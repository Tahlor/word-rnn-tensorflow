The shades of night were falling fast,
As through an Eastern village passed
A youth who bore, through dust and heat,
A stencil-plate, that read complete--"SAPOLIO."
His brow was sad, but underneath,
White with "Odonto" shone his teeth,
And through them hissed the words, "Well, blow
Me tight if here is 'ary show!" "SAPOLIO."
On household fences, gleaming bright,
Shone "Gargling Oil," in black and white,
Once "Bixby's Blacking" stood alone,
He straight beside it clapped his own--"SAPOLIO."
"Try not my fence," the old man said,
"With 'Mustang Liniment' 'tis spread,
Another vacant spot thar aint."
He answered with a dash of paint--"SAPOLIO."
"O, stay," the maiden said, "A rest
Pray give us! What with 'Bixby's Best,'
And 'Simmons' Pills,' we're like to die."
He only answered, "Will you try--SAPOLIO?"
"Beware them peaks! That wall so bright
Is but a snow bank, gleaming white,
Your paint wont stick!" Came the reply,
"I've done it! 'How is that for high?'" "SAPOLIO."
One Sabbath morn, as heavenward
White Mountain tourists slowly spurred,
On ev'ry rock, to their dismay,
They read that legend strange, alway--"SAPOLIO"
There on the summit, old and fat,
Shameless, but vigorous, he sat,
While on their luggage as they passed,
He checked that word, from first to last, "SAPOLIO."
