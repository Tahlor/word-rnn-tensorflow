A Frog he would a-wooing go,
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
Whether his Mother would let him or no.
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
So off he set with his opera-hat,
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
And on his way he met with a Rat.
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
"Pray, MR. RAT, will you go with me,"
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
"Pretty MISS MOUSEY for to see?"
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
Now they soon arrived at Mousey's Hall,
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
And gave a loud knock, and gave a loud call.
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
"Pray, Miss MOUSEY, are you within?"
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
"Oh, yes, kind Sirs, I'm sitting to spin."
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
"Pray, Miss MOUSE, will you give us some beer?"
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
"For Froggy and I are fond of good cheer."
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho says_, ANTHONY ROWLEY!
"Pray, Mr. FROG, will you give us a song?
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
"But let it be something that's not very long."
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
"Indeed, Miss MOUSE," replied Mr FROG,
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
"A cold has made me as hoarse as a Hog."
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
"Since you have caught cold," Miss MOUSEY said.
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
"I'll sing you a song that I have just made."
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
But while they were all thus a merry-making,
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
A Cat and her Kittens came tumbling in.
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
The Cat she seized the Rat by the crown;
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
The Kittens they pulled the little Mouse down.
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
This put Mr. FROG in a terrible fright;
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
He took up his hat, and he wished them good night.
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
But as Froggy was crossing a silvery brook,
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
A lily-white Duck came and gobbled him up.
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
So there was an end of one, two, and three,
_Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
The Rat, the Mouse, and the little Frog-gee!
_With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
_Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
