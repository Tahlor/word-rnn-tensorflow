INTRODUCTION.


In the heart of the Perthshire Highlands, and not far from the northern
shore of Loch Tay, there lies a secluded vale of about six miles
long. The river Lyon, which issues from the long and narrow valley of
Glenlyon through the pass of Chesthill, hardly less beautiful than
the celebrated pass of Killichranky, meanders through it. On the east
bank of a small stream which falls into the Lyon about the centre of
the vale, is the Clachan or Kirkton of Fortingall, anciently called
Fothergill, from which it takes its name; and on the west or opposite
bank is the mansion of Glenlyon House, anciently called Tullichmullin.

A stranger stationed at the clachan or little village of Fortingall,
would almost fancy that there was neither egress from nor ingress to
this little district, so secluded and shut in among the surrounding
mountains does it appear to be. It is a spot where one could well
suppose that the traditions of former times, and the remains of a
forgotten oral literature, might still linger in the memories of its
inhabitants; while the local names of the mountains and streams about
it are redolent of the mythic times of the Feine. On the west is the
glen of Glenlyon, the ancient Cromgleann nan Clach or Crooked Glen of
the Stones, associated with many a tradition of the Feine, and where
the remains of those rude forts, termed Caistealan na Feine, crown many
a rocky summit; and the vale is bounded on the south and east by the
ridge of Druimfhionn or Finn‚Äôs Ridge.

In the latter part of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth
centuries, there dwelt here a family of the name of Macgregor. They
were descended from a vicar of Fortingall, who, at the time when,
during the century preceding the Reformation, the Catholic Church was
breaking up, and their benefices passing into the hands of laymen,
secured for himself and his descendants the vicarage of Fortingall and
a lease of the church lands.

Of the history of this family we know somewhat from an obituary
commenced by one of his descendants, and continued to the year 1579 by
the Curate of Fothergill, which is still preserved.

His son, whether legitimate or illegitimate we know not, was Ian
Rewych, or John the Grizzled, termed Makgewykar or son of the Vicar.[1]

His grandson was Dougall Maol, or Dougall the Bald or Tonsured, called
patronymically Dougall Johnson, or the son of John.

MacGewykar apud Aychly in Mense Decembris anno Domini Mvcxlij.--Chron.
Fort.

This Dougall Johnson appears in 1511 as a notary-public,[2] and
dwelt at Tullichmullin, where his wife Katherine, daughter of Donald
M‚ÄôClawe, _alias_ Grant, died in 1512.[3] He is twice mentioned in the
obituary or Chronicle of Fortingall; in 1526, as repairing the cross in
Inchadin, or the old church of Kenmore, situated on the north bank of
the river Tay, nearly opposite Taymouth Castle; and in 1529, as placing
a stone cross in Larkmonemerkyth, the name of a pass among the hills
which leads from Inchadin to the south.[4]

Of Dougall the Bald, the son of John the Grizzled, we have no further
mention; but of his family we know of two sons, James and Duncan.

James was a Churchman. He appears as a notary-public, an office then
held by ecclesiastics, along with his father, in the year 1511, and
he early attained to honour and influence, through what channel is
unknown; for, in 1514, we find him Dean of Lismore,[5] an island in
Argyllshire, lying between the districts of Lorn and Morvern, which
was at that time the Episcopal seat of the Bishops of Argyll. He was,
besides, Vicar of Fortingall and Firmarius or tenant of the church
lands; and died possessed of these benefices in the year 1551, and was
buried in the choir of the old church of Inchadin.[6]

In 1552, a year after his death, Gregor Macgregor, son of the deceased
Sir James Macgregor, Dean of Lismore, as became the head of a small
but independent sept of the Macgregors, and with a due regard to its
safety, bound himself to Colin Campbell of Glenurchy and his heirs,
‚Äútaking him for his chief, in place of the Laird of Macgregor, and
giving him his calp.‚Äù[7]

In 1557 Gregor and Dougall Macgregors, natural sons of Sir James
Macgregor, receive letters of legitimation;[8] and, in 1574, Dougall
Macgregor appears as Chancellor of Lismore.[9]

It is unnecessary for our purpose to follow the history of this
family any further; suffice it to say, that the two brothers, James
and Duncan,[10] members of a clan which, though under the ban of the
Government, and exposed to the grasping aggression of their powerful
neighbours, the Campbells of Glenurchy, considered themselves as
peculiarly Highland, and had high pretensions, as descended from the
old Celtic monarchs of Scotland--connected with the Church, and as
such, possessing some cultivation of mind and such literary taste as
Churchmen at that time had, yet born and reared in the farm-house of
Tullichmullin, in the secluded vale of Fortingall, and imbued with that
love of old Highland story and cherished fondness for Highland song,
which manifests itself in so many a quiet country Highlander, and which
the scenery and associations around them were so well calculated to
foster--the one, from his high position in the Church of Argyll, having
peculiar facilities for collecting the poetry current in the West
Highlands--the other, though his brother, yet, as was not uncommon in
those days, his servitor or amanuensis, and himself a poet--and both
natives of the Perthshire Highlands--collected and transcribed into a
commonplace book Gaelic poetry obtained from all quarters.

This collection has fortunately been preserved. It is, unquestionably,
a native compilation made in the central Highlands, upwards of
three hundred years ago. It contains the remains of an otherwise
lost literature. In it we find all that we can now recover of
native compositions current in the Highlands prior to the sixteenth
century, as well as the means of ascertaining the extent to which the
Highlanders were familiar with the works of Irish poets.

It is a quarto volume of some 311 pages, and is written in the current
Roman hand of the period. Though much injured by time, the leaves in
part worn away, and the ink faint, it is still possible to read the
greater part of its contents.

With the exception of a short Latin obituary, and one or two other
short pieces, it consists entirely of a collection of Gaelic poetry
made by the two brothers.

At the bottom of the 27th page appears the following note in
Latin:--Liber Dni Jacobi Macgregor Decani Lismoren.

At page 78, there is a chronological list of Scottish kings written in
the Scottish language, which ends thus:--‚ÄúJames the Fyfte reignis now
in great felicitie.‚Äù He reigned from 1513 to 1542; and, on page 161,
there is a genealogy of the Macgregors, written by the brother Duncan,
deducing their descent from the old Scottish kings, and he adds a
docquet in Gaelic, which may be thus translated:--Duncan the Servitor,
the son of Dougall, who was son of John the Grizzled, wrote this from
the Book of the History of the Kings, and it was done in the year
1512.[11]

There can be no question, therefore, that this collection was formed
during the lifetime of the Dean of Lismore, and a great part of it
as early as the year 1512. How it was preserved through that and
the succeeding century is unknown. In the last century it passed
into the possession of the Highland Society of London, by whom it
was transferred to the custody of the Highland Society of Scotland,
when a committee of that Society was engaged in an inquiry into the
authenticity of the Poems of Ossian, published by Macpherson. It has
now been deposited, along with other Gaelic MSS. in the possession of
that Society, in the Library of the Faculty of Advocates, and forms
part of that collection of Gaelic MSS. which have been brought together
within the last few years, and contain nearly all the Gaelic MSS. which
are known still to exist.[12]

Deyroclych is Daoroglach, and is the Gaelic rendering of Servitor.

[12] This collection has been formed within the last few years mainly
through the instrumentality of the writer. When he commenced, the
Faculty of Advocates possessed four Gaelic MSS. The collection now
consists of sixty-five.

The writer formed the plan of collecting the remains of the MS. Gaelic
literature of Scotland, which was rapidly disappearing, into one
place, where they could be preserved, by inducing the possessors of
Gaelic MSS. to deposit them in some public library for preservation;
and as the Faculty of Advocates were already in the possession of some
MSS., their library was evidently the most appropriate depository for
this purpose. The valuable MSS. belonging to the Highland Society of
Scotland formed the basis of the collection; the directors, and their
secretary, John Hall Maxwell, Esq., C.B., having at once responded to
the call, and the fortunate discovery of the Kilbride collection, which
its possessor likewise agreed to deposit, added a large number. The
remainder consists of MSS. deposited by individual possessors, and the
collection now embraces nearly all the MSS. known or believed still to
exist.

It is hoped that, if any Gaelic MSS. still remain in the hands of
individual possessors, they will add to the value of this collection by
making them known, and depositing them in the Advocates‚Äô Library for
preservation.

The MSS. are preserved in a locked cabinet, and a general catalogue of
the whole has been prepared by the writer.

The Dean‚Äôs MS. differs from all the other MSS. in that collection in
two essential particulars. It is not, like the other MSS., written in
what is called the Irish character, but in the current Roman character
of the early part of the sixteenth century; and the language is not
written in the orthography used in writing Irish, and now universally
employed in writing Scotch Gaelic, but in a peculiar kind of phonetic
orthography, which aims at presenting the words in English orthography
as they are pronounced.

The peculiar orthography employed is, however, evidently not the mere
attempt of a person ignorant of the proper orthography to write the
words in English letters in an arbitrary manner, so as to present, as
nearly as possible, the sound of the words as they struck his ear when
repeated to him, but bears evident marks of having been a regular and
known system of orthography, which, although we have few specimens
of it left, may not the less have once prevailed in that part of the
Highlands more removed from the influence of Irish teaching.

It is a peculiarity of all the Celtic dialects, that the consonants
suffer a change in the beginning of words, from the influence of the
preceding words, or in forming the oblique cases, and likewise change
their sound in the middle of words by being aspirated.

In the Irish orthography, the original consonant is invariably
preserved; and the change is indicated by prefixing another consonant
when the sound is affected by eclipsis, or the influence of the
preceding word, or by adding the letter _h_, when it is changed by
aspiration.

In the Welsh dialects, however, and in the Manx, which is a dialect
of the Gaelic division of the Celtic languages, a different system of
orthography has always prevailed. Instead of retaining the original
letter, and indicating the change in the sound by prefixing or adding
another, a different letter expressing simply the new sound, is
substituted for the original letter; and hence the orthography bears
more of a phonetic and less of an etymologic character.

Both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. In the one, the
original form of the word is preserved, and the primary sounds of the
letters are retained. The alteration in their sound in inflection is
marked by prefixing another letter, or adding the letter _h_. It is by
the application of grammatical rules that the pronunciation of the word
is ascertained, and that pronunciation may deviate from time to time
to a greater degree from the original standard, while the orthography,
always remaining the same, fails to chronicle it.

In the other, a new letter is substituted for the original letter, when
the sound is changed by inflection, or by the position of the word in a
sentence, and the orthography employed expresses the pronunciation of
the word in its inflected, without reference to its original form.

The one presents the language in its etymologic form, without reference
to its pronunciation, and is of value in preserving the original form
of the written speech.

The other stereotypes its sounds as spoken at the time; it is committed
to writing without reference to the original form or primary shape of
the words; and is of value in exhibiting the living dialects as spoken
by the people.

An apt illustration of this is afforded by the English language and its
dialects.

The English orthography exhibits the language as it once was, but
from which it has greatly deviated in pronunciation; and it is hardly
possible to frame rules by applying which, to the orthography, the
present pronunciation can be deduced. It is obvious that if the words,
which are differently pronounced in the Scotch dialect, were spelt
according to the English orthography, no clue would be afforded to
its peculiarities. On the other hand, when the Scotch dialect is spelt
phonetically, as is done, for instance, by Sir Walter Scott in his
Scotch romances, the peculiarities in the pronunciation of a living
dialect are vividly presented, and these elements of the original
language, which may have been preserved in this dialect, are made
available for philological purposes.

The collection of Gaelic poetry made by the Dean of Lismore and his
brother is thus written in an orthography of this latter class. It
attracted some notice when the Highland Society was engaged in its
inquiry into the authenticity of Ossian‚Äôs Poems, from its including
among its contents some poems attributed to Ossian. Three of these are
printed in the report, though incorrectly and imperfectly, but little
was known of the other contents of the MS.

A transcript was made of the MS. for the Highland Society by the late
Mr. Ewen M‚ÄôLachlan, an accomplished Gaelic scholar, who was employed
to examine their MS. It, however, passed into the possession of the
Rev. J. Macintyre of Kilmanievaig, who allowed it to be examined for
a short time by the editors, but no full or correct account was given
of the MS. till the Rev. T. M‚ÄôLauchlan, one of the editors of this
work, read an account of it to the Society of Scottish Antiquaries in
the year 1856, which is printed in their proceedings.[13] This account
attracted considerable notice to the MS., and led to its value being
more appreciated. The present publication has, in consequence, been
undertaken.

[13] Vol. ii. pt. i. p. 35.

The Dean‚Äôs MS. has a double value, philological and literary, and is
calculated to throw light both on the language and the literature of
the Highlands of Scotland. It has a philological value, because its
peculiar orthography presents the language at the time in its aspect
and character as a spoken language, and enables us to ascertain
whether many of the peculiarities which now distinguish it were in
existence three hundred years ago; and it has a literary value, because
it contains poems attributed to Ossian, and to other poets prior to
the sixteenth century, which are not to be found elsewhere; and thus
presents to us specimens of the traditionary poetry current in the
Highlands prior to that period, which are above suspicion, having
been collected upwards of three hundred years ago, and before any
controversy on the subject had arisen.

It has been found impossible to present so large a collection entire,
but the selection has been made with reference to these two objects.
Each poem selected for publication has been presented entire. There
is a literal translation of the poem made by the Rev. T. M‚ÄôLauchlan,
and appended is the original Gaelic text of the poem in the Dean‚Äôs
orthography, exactly as it appears in the MS.; and, on the opposite
page, the same Gaelic has been transferred by Mr. M‚ÄôLauchlan into
the modern orthography of the Scotch Gaelic, which is nearly the
same as that of the Irish, so as to afford the means of comparing
the one orthography with the other, and the modern spoken dialect in
the Highlands with the language of the poems collected by the Dean
upwards of three hundred years ago, as well as to furnish a test of
the accuracy of the translation, by showing the rendering given to the
Dean‚Äôs language.[14]

The present spoken language of the Highlands of Scotland is, as is
well known, a dialect[15] of that great branch of the Celtic languages
termed the Gwyddelian or Gaelic, and to which belong also the Irish
and Manx, or spoken language of the Isle of Man. These three dialects
of the Gaelic branch of the Celtic languages, the Irish, the Scotch
Gaelic, and the Manx, approach each other so nearly, as to form in fact
but one language; and the peculiarities which distinguish them from one
another are not of a nature sufficiently broad or vital to constitute
either of them a distinct language.

[14] It is hardly possible to convey to the reader an adequate
conception of the labour of the task undertaken by Mr. M‚ÄôLauchlan,
or of the courage, perseverance, and ability with which it has been
overcome. Mr. M‚ÄôLauchlan had first to read the Dean‚Äôs transcript--no
ordinary task, when, to a strange orthography, affording no clue to the
original word, was added a careless handwriting of the beginning of the
sixteenth century, faded ink, and decayed paper. He had then to convert
it into the corresponding Gaelic in its modern shape and orthography,
and then to translate it into English, in which he had to combine
the literal rendering of an idiomatic language with an intelligible
exhibition of its meaning in English.

It may be as well to take this opportunity of stating, that Mr.
M‚ÄôLauchlan is solely responsible for the selection made from the Dean‚Äôs
MS., the rendering in modern Gaelic, the English translation, and the
notes at the foot of the page. The writer of this is responsible only
for the Introduction and the additional notes, to which his name is
attached.

[15] I use the word _dialect_ throughout, in the restricted sense of
the German word _mundart_, for want of a better English word to express
it.

The language spoken by the Highlanders of Scotland is termed by them
simply Gaelic; but the name of Erse has occasionally been bestowed upon
it during the last few centuries by the Lowlanders.[16] As early as the
year 1690 a short vocabulary of Scotch Gaelic words was appended to an
edition of Bedel‚Äôs Irish Bible, to adapt it to the use of the Scotch
Highlanders; and a somewhat fuller vocabulary, by the same author, was
published in Nicolson‚Äôs Scottish Historical Library in 1702.

In 1741, a more complete vocabulary was published by the Society for
Propagating Christian Knowledge, for the use of their schools in the
Highlands. It was compiled by Mr. Alexander M‚ÄôDonald, schoolmaster
at Ardnamurchan. Another vocabulary was published in 1795 by Robert
M‚ÄôFarlane; and, in 1815, a further step in advance was made by the
larger vocabulary of Mr. P. M‚ÄôFarlane.

In 1825, a large quarto dictionary of the Scotch Gaelic was published
by R. A. Armstrong; and in three years afterwards the splendid
dictionary compiled by the first Gaelic scholars, under the auspices of
the Highland Society of Scotland, appeared. In this dictionary Gaelic
words from all quarters are inserted; but those which belong to the
vernacular dialect of the Scotch Highlands are carefully distinguished.

The small dictionary compiled by M‚ÄôAlpine, a schoolmaster in Islay,
affords a genuine representation of the Gaelic spoken in that island.

[16] This term is unknown to the Highlanders, who call themselves
Albanaich; and was a term of reproach applied to them by the
Lowlanders, from their language being the same as the Irish. It is
curious that the same reproach was applied by the English to the Scotch
in the twelfth century. Lambarde records that, at the battle of the
Standard, when the Scots shouted _Albany, Albany!_ the English soldiers
retorted with _Yry, Yry!_ ‚Äúa term of great reproach at that time.‚Äù

The only grammar of the Scotch Gaelic which it is necessary to notice,
is the able and philosophic grammar by Alexander Stewart, Minister of
the Gospel at Dingwall, the first edition of which was published in
1801, and the second in 1812. As a first attempt to reduce the spoken
language of the Scotch Highlanders to a grammatical system, it is a
work of rare excellence and fidelity, and all other grammars have been
more or less taken from it.

This grammar, then, and the vocabularies and dictionaries above
referred to, contain the Gaelic language as spoken, at the time of
their compilation, in the Highlands of Scotland, and afford the
materials for judging of the character of those peculiarities which
distinguish it from the Irish and Manx Gaelic.[17]

[17] I reject from this list the grammar and dictionary by the Rev. Wm.
Shaw, published in 1778 and 1780, because, so far as they purport to
be a grammar and dictionary of the Scotch Gaelic dialect, they are a
deception, and not trustworthy.

Shaw was a native of Arran, where a corrupt and Irishised Gaelic is
spoken; and it is well known that he failed in his attempt to compile
his dictionary from the spoken language in the Highlands, where he made
a tour for the purpose, and resorted to Ireland, where he manufactured
his works from Irish sources and authorities, adapting the Irish
grammar to a very imperfect knowledge of the language.

The subscribers complained of the deception, and refused to take the
work, till compelled by a process at law. The evidence taken in this
process is very instructive as to the position of Shaw‚Äôs grammar and
dictionary, so far as their Irish element is concerned, towards the
Scotch Gaelic dialect at that period.

The differences between the spoken language of the Scottish Highlands
and the Irish exist partly in the pronunciation, where the accentuation
of the language is different, where that peculiar change in the initial
consonant, produced by the influence of the previous word, and termed
by the Irish grammarians eclipsis, is unknown except in the sibilant,
where the vowel sounds are different, and there are even traces of
a consonantal permutation; partly in the grammar, where the Scotch
Gaelic prefers the analytic form of the verb, and has no present
tense, the old present being now used for the future, and the present
formed by the auxiliary verb, where the plural of one class of the
nouns is formed in a peculiar manner, resembling the Anglo-Saxon, and
a different negative is used; partly in the idioms of the language,
where a greater preference is shown to express the idea by the use of
substantives, and the verb is anxiously avoided; and in the vocabulary,
which varies to a considerable extent, where words now obsolete in
Irish are still living words, and others are used in a different
sense.[18]

The Scotch Gaelic is spoken in its greatest purity in the central
districts of the Highlands, including Mull, Morvern, Ardnamurchan,
Ardgowar, Appin, Lochaber, and that district termed the Garbh
chriochan, or rough bounds, consisting of Arisaig, Moydart, Moror,
and Knoydart. The language here spoken is characterized by a closer
adherence to grammatical rules, by a fuller and more careful
pronunciation of the vowel sounds, by a selection of the best words to
express the idea, and by their use in their primary sense.

In the county of Argyll, and the islands which face the coast of
Ireland, the language approaches much more nearly to the Ulster dialect
of the Irish, there being probably no perceptible difference between
the form of the language in Isla and Rachrin, or in Cantyre and the
opposite coast of Antrim.

[18] A more detailed statement of the differences between Scotch and
Irish Gaelic will be found in the additional Notes.

In the Gaelic of Sutherland and Caithness, again, there are marked
differences of a different and opposite character, a native of
Sutherland and the southern districts of Argyll having some difficulty
in understanding each other; and in Perthshire, on the other hand, the
influence of the English language is apparent, the pronunciation is
more careless, the words selected less pure, and the secondary senses
of many are only used.

The central districts afford the best type of that variety of Gaelic
which forms the spoken language of the Highlands of Scotland.

Of this language two views may be taken. The peculiarities of the
language may have sprung up quite recently, and the language may, at no
very distant period, have been absolutely identical in form and sound
with the Irish, from which it may have become corrupted by the absence
of cultivation, and must be regarded merely as the rude _patois_ of
a people whose ignorance of the cultivated language has led to their
adoption of peculiarities sanctioned by no grammatical rule; or, on the
other hand, these peculiarities may partake rather of the character
of dialectic differences, and enter more deeply into the organization
of the language, and thus may have characterized it from that remoter
period, when geographical separation and political isolation may have
led to the formation, in the Highlands of Scotland, of a dialectic
variety of the common language.

The first is the view taken by Irish grammarians, and if correct, these
differences cannot be considered as of any philological importance. The
question has not, however, been treated by them in a candid spirit, or
with any grasp of the subject; and their opinion must be based upon
a more accurate knowledge of the spoken dialect which is the subject
of it, and upon a sounder and more impartial examination of those
philologic elements which ought to enter into its consideration, before
it can be accepted as conclusive. If the second view is the correct
one, then it is obvious that the Scotch Gaelic is well deserving of
study, as a distinct variety of the Gaelic language which was common
to Scotland and Ireland; and everything that tends to throw light upon
it, and upon the existence and origin of these differences, acquires a
philologic value.

In the study of language, the spoken dialects are of great value. It is
from the study of the living dialects, which are not merely corruptions
of the spoken language, but present dialectic peculiarities, that we
arrive at a full perception of the character and tendencies of the
mother tongue.

It is the destiny of all languages, that they no sooner enter upon the
domain of history than they begin to alter, decompose, and split into
dialects. The formation of the mother tongue belongs to the prehistoric
period; and it is a process which, carried on in the infancy and growth
of the social state, is concealed from observation. When its possessors
first emerge into view, and take their place among the history of
nations, counter influences have already been at work, their language
has already entered upon its downward course, and we can only watch it
in its process of decomposition and alteration, and reach its primitive
condition, through the medium of its dialects.

There are two opposing influences by which all languages are
affected--the etymologic and the phonetic. The etymologic principle
is all-powerful in the formation and original structure of the
language, producing combinations of sounds demanded by the laws of
its composition, but irrespective altogether of the requirements of
harmony, or the tendencies of the human organs of sound. It contains
in it, however, the seeds of its own destruction, and has no sooner
completed its work of formation than a process of modification and
decomposition commences, caused by the respective idiosyncrasies of
its speakers, their craving after harmony of combination and ease of
utterance, and the influence of physical situation and surrounding
agents upon the organs of speech.

These phonetic causes enter at once into conflict with the strictly
etymologic formations of the language, moulding its sounds, decomposing
its structure, and interchanging the organs producing the sounds; and
these effects are perpetuated by circumstances causing the separation
or isolation of the people who have adopted them, while new words
and combinations are added to their vocabulary by new wants arising
in their separate state, by their advance in social condition, or by
the peculiarities of their new condition. Thus innumerable dialects
spring up. Whenever a difference of situation takes place among the
people composing the aggregate by whom the original language was
spoken, a diversity of dialect is at once created. In these dialects
are preserved the bones of the mother tongue; and it is only by a
comparison of these that her full character can be ascertained.

This tendency of the mother tongue, to break up into as many dialects
as there are shades of difference in the position and tendencies
of its speakers, is only arrested by the formation of a cultivated
dialect, created when the wants of an educated or cultivated class in
the community demand a common medium of interchanging their ideas.
This cultivated language is usually first formed by poetry, completed
by writing, and adopted by education. Its first stage is that of the
language in which the songs and poems, the first literature of a rude
people, are recited by its bards, its earliest literary class; and,
by the introduction of the art of writing, it passes over into the
written speech. It then becomes a common dialect, spoken and written by
the cultivated class of the community, and to a knowledge of which a
portion of the people are raised by education.

This cultivated or written language may have been originally one of
the numerous dialects spoken by the people composing the community,
and which circumstances have elevated into that position; or it may
have been introduced from another country speaking a sister dialect,
which has preceded it in cultivation; or it may, like the German,
have been developed from an unspoken variety of the language created
by other causes and for other purposes. In the one case, the language
first cultivated by poetry passes over into the written language. In
the other, it remains an indigenous, cultivated, spoken language, which
is antagonistic to, and contends with, the imported written speech till
the influence of the latter prevails, and it is either extinguished
by it, or remains as popular poetry in the vernacular tongue, while
everything prose is absorbed.

But however it originates, the spoken dialects still remain as the
vernacular speech of portions of the community. They are not the
children or creatures of the written speech, still less corruptions of
it, but are equally ancient, and retain much of the elements of the
original language which the written speech has rejected.

The formation of a cultivated or written language is always an eclectic
process. It selects, it modifies, and it rejects, while the living
dialects retain many of the forms and much of the structure modified
and rejected by it. Hence, for the study of the character and formation
of the mother tongue, the living spoken dialects are of the first
importance; and a restricted attention to the written language, and the
contemptuous rejection of everything in the spoken dialects which vary
from it, as barbarisms and corruptions, is simply to part with much
valuable material for the study, and to narrow the range of inquiry.[19]

[19] Professor Max M√ºller has the following excellent remarks in his
recent lectures on the Science of Language, p. 49. ‚ÄúThe real and
natural life of language is in its dialects; and in spite of the
tyranny exercised by the classical or literary idioms, the day is still
very far off which is to see the dialects entirely eradicated....

‚ÄúIt is a mistake to imagine that dialects are everywhere corruptions
of the literary language.... Dialects have always been the feeders
rather than the channels of a literary language; anyhow, they are
parallel streams which existed long before one of them was raised to
that temporary eminence which is the result of literary cultivation.‚Äù
The whole of the lecture in which this passage occurs is well worthy
of perusal, in regard to the proper view and position of the spoken
dialects in the study of language.

Schleicher takes the same view in his masterly work, ‚ÄúDie Deutsche
Sprache.‚Äù He says, in relation to the German language, what is equally
true of the Gaelic:

‚ÄúDie mundarten sind die nat√ºrlichen nach den Gesetzen der
Sprachgeschichtlichen Ver√§nderungen gewordenen Formen im Gegensatze
zu der mehr oder minder gemachten and schulmeisterisch geregelten and
zugestutzten Sprache der Schrift. Schon hieraus folgt der hohe Werth
derselben f√ºr die wissenschaftliche Erforschung unserer Sprache; hier
ist eine reiche F√ºllevon Worten und Formen, die, an sich gut und echt,
von der Schriftsprache verschm√§ht wurden; hier finden wir manches,
was wir zur Erkl√§rung der √§lteren Sprachdenkmale, ja zur Erkenntniss
der jetzigen Schriftsprache verwerthen k√∂nnen, abgesehen von dem
Sprachgeschichtlichen, dem lautphysiologischen Interesse, welches die
√ºberaus reiche Mannigfaltigkeit unserer Mundarten bietet.

‚ÄúWer einer Mundart kundig ist, der hat beim Studium des altdeutschen
einen grossen Vorsprung vor demjenigen voraus der nur in der
Schriftsprache heimisch ist.

‚Äú_Nichts ist th√∂richter, nichts verr√§th mehr den Mangel wahrer Bildung
als das Verrachten unserer Mundarten._‚Äù--P. 110.

Perhaps the English language affords an illustration of these remarks.
As a written and cultivated language, it took its rise in England, but
was introduced from England into Scotland.

In England, the provincial dialects have remained as the spoken
language of the uncultivated class in the respective provinces side
by side with it; but their antiquity and their value for philological
purposes is fully acknowledged. No one dreams of viewing them as
merely corruptions of the written language, arising from rudeness and
ignorance.

In Scotland, the English language has been introduced as the written
or cultivated language, but a different form of the language, the
Broad Scotch, is the vernacular speech of the people, and preceded the
English language as the written language of the country in which its
earliest literature was contained. Its great value, as an early form of
the original Anglic tongue which formed the language of the country,
is so fully acknowledged, that Jamieson‚Äôs Dictionary of the Scotch
language has been called the best dictionary of the English language.
It has ceased to be a vehicle for prose composition; but there exists
a ballad literature in the Scotch dialect which has resisted the
absorbing influence of the English.

So it was also in the Scotch Highlands, where the written and
cultivated language did not originate in this country, but was brought
over from Ireland in the sixth century, though in this case the analogy
is not so great, from the various dialects of the Gaelic having
probably at all times approached each other much more nearly than the
provincial dialects of England and Scotland, and been more greatly
influenced by the written language.

In order to determine the philological position and value of the Scotch
Gaelic, it is necessary to form a more accurate conception of the
historical position of the people who spoke it, and of the influences
to which they have been exposed, and by which the language was likely
to be affected.

Two races seem to have entered, as original elements, into the
population of Ireland and of the Highlands of Scotland. These were the
race of the Scots and the people termed by the early Irish authorities
the race of the Cruithne. The latter appear everywhere to have
preceded the former.

Prior to the sixth century, the Cruithne alone seem to have formed the
population of the Scotch Highlands. In Ireland they formed the original
population of Ulster and the north part of Leinster. Connaught, the
rest of Leinster, and Munster, were Scottish. The east and north of
Ireland appear to have been most exposed to external influences, and to
have suffered the greatest changes in their population. In the south
and west it was more permanent; and from Connaught and Leinster the
royal races of the Scots emerged, while their colonies proceeded from
south and west to north and east.

The traditionary history of Ireland records an early settlement of the
Scots among the Cruithne of Ulster, termed from its mythic founder
Dalriada, and likewise the fall of the great seat of the Cruithnian
kingdom, called Emania, before an expedition, led by a scion of the
Scottish royal race, who established the kingdom of Orgialla on its
ruins. It is certain that, while we have reason to believe that the
Cruithne formed the original population of the whole of Ulster, we find
them in the historic period confined to certain districts in Ulster
only, although their kings retained the title of kings of Ulster.

In the beginning of the sixth century, the Scots, who are frequently
recorded by the Roman writers as forming part of the predatory bands
who, from time to time, assailed the Roman province, and finally
overthrew their empire in Britain, passed over to the opposite coast
of Argyll, and effected a permanent settlement there, which, from its
mother tribe, was also called Dalriada. This settlement is recorded,
by the oldest authority, to have taken place twenty years after the
battle of Ocha, which was fought in the year 483, and, therefore, in
the year 503. The territory occupied by this settlement of the Scots
was the south part of Argyllshire, consisting of the districts of
Cowall, Kintyre, Knapdale, Argyll-proper, Lorn, and probably part of
Morvern, with the islands of Isla, Iona, Arran, and the small islands
adjacent. The boundary which separated them from the Cruithne was on
the east, the range of mountains termed Drumalban, a mountain chain
which still separates the county of Argyll from that of Perth. On the
north, the boundary, which probably was not very distinct, and varied
from time to time, seems to have been coincident with a line extending
from the Island of Colonsay through the Island of Mull to the centre
of the district of Morvern, through which it passed to the shores of
the Luine Loch opposite Appin.[20] The rest of the Highlands was still
occupied by the Cruithne, who were Pagans, while the Dalriadic Scots
were Christians.

[20] In the Island of Colonsay there is a cairn called Carn cul ri
Erin. In Bleau‚Äôs Atlas, the map of the Island of Mull marks, on the
high mountain which separates the north from the south of the island,
two cairns, called Carn cul ri Erin and Carn cul ri Allabyn. These
seem to mark some ancient boundary; but as they are exactly in a line
with Iona,--which seems to have lain so nearly on the boundary as
to be claimed by both races, and also with the line which separates
the ancient parishes of Killintach and Killcholumkill in Morvern,
and Killintach is said, in an old document, to be in Garwmorvaren,
a district which extended as far north as Loch Hourn, while
Killcholumkill is said to be in Kinelbadon, which belonged to the
ancient kingdom of Lorn,--there seems much reason to conclude that this
may have been the line of the boundary between the Dalriad Scots from
Erin and the Cruithne of Alban.

In the year 563, an event took place which was destined to exercise
a powerful influence both on the condition and the language of the
population. This was the mission of Saint Columba, a Scot from Ireland,
to convert the Cruithne to the Christian faith, and the consequent
foundation of the Monastery of Iona, which became the seat of learning,
and the source of all ecclesiastical authority, both for the Cruithne
and the Dalriadic Scots, from whence innumerable Scottish clergy
issued, who spread over the country and founded churches among the
Cruithne under its influence and authority.

The platform occupied by the two populations, embracing both Ireland
and the Highlands of Scotland, in the sixth century, thus showed in the
south and west of Ireland pure Scots; in the north and east settlements
of Scots among the Cruithne, gradually confining the latter to isolated
districts; in Argyll, a Scottish settlement among the Cruithne of
Alban; and in the rest of the Highlands pure Cruithne; but over both
Scots and Cruithne in Alban a Scottish clergy, who brought a cultivated
and literary language with them.

In Ireland the Gaelic spoken in the different provinces varies, and
probably has always varied from each other. They differ in words,
pronunciation, and idiom; and in grammatical construction and idiom
there is a marked difference between the Gaelic of the northern and
of the southern half of Ireland. The written language resembles most
the language of the south and west of Ireland. It seems to have been
formed from it, and to have become the common language of the literary
and cultivated class, while the other dialects remained as the spoken
language of their respective populations.

This written language was brought over to Scotland in the sixth century
by Columba and his clergy, who introduced it, with Christianity, among
the Cruithne; where, however, the native dialect must have received
some cultivation, as we find that he was opposed by Magi, which implies
a literary class among the Pagan Cruithne. At this time there was so
little political separation between the two countries, that the Scots
of British Dalriada remained subject to the Irish Dalriada, from which
they emerged, till the year 573, when Aedan, son of Gabran, became
king of Scotch Dalriada, and, at the great Council of Drumceat, it was
declared independent of Irish Dalriada, and he was crowned as its first
independent monarch. The Cruithne of Ireland, likewise, formed part of
that great Cruithnian kingdom, which had its head-quarters in Scotland,
till the reign of Fiacha mac Baedan, King of Ulster, who ruled over the
Irish Cruithne from 589 to 626, and probably in the year 608, when they
threw off the yoke of the Cruithne of Scotland.[21]

[21] There were thirty kings of the Cruithne over Eri and Alba,
viz., of the Cruithne of Alba and of the Cruithne of Eri, _i.e._,
of Dalaraidhe. They were from Ollamhan to Fiachna mac Baedain, who
fettered the hostages of Eri and Alba.

A.D. 608. Bass Fiachrach chraich mic Baedan la Cruithnechu.--(Tigh.
An.)

The Cruithne and the Scots of Ireland and of Scotland then first
became separated from, and independent of, each other, and a complete
political separation took place between the two countries.

The Cruithne of Scotland remained under the influence of the Scottish
clergy till the beginning of the eighth century, when their king,
Nectan, adopted the usages of the Romish party, and in 717 expelled
the Scottish clergy out of his dominions across the boundary of
Drumalban,[22] which separated them from the Scots of Dalriada, and
a new clergy was introduced into that part of the country, occupied
by the Cruithne, from the Anglic kingdom of Northumberland. In 731,
we learn from Bede, who then closes his history, that the Scots of
Dalriada were still confined within the same limits; and that no change
had up to that date taken place in the relative positions of the two
populations, the Cruithne and the Scots. After this date we know little
of the history of the population of the Highlands till the middle
of the ninth century, when we find that a great change had, in the
interval, taken place in their political condition. The two populations
had now become united in one kingdom, and a family of undoubted
Scottish race ruled over the united people.

rege.

Of the events which brought about this great change, authentic history
tells us nothing--of the fact there can be no doubt; and the question
arises of how the Gaelic language originated in the undalriadic part
of the Highlands. Prior to this date, it was exclusively occupied by
people of the race of the Cruithne, first Pagan under native Magi,
then Christian, and for 150 years under clergy of Scottish race, who
were, however, driven out in the year 717. Either then these Cruithne
spoke a Gaelic dialect, or, if they spoke a different language, we
must suppose that the language of Gaelic Dalriada had, subsequently to
the ninth century, spread, with the rule of a Scottish king, over the
whole of the Highlands not embraced in that limited territory. We have
no materials for determining this question. The latter supposition has
always been assumed by the Irish historians, but without proof; and
they have never attempted to account for the entire disappearance of
the previous language, and the expulsion of the previous population
of so extensive a district, so mountainous and inaccessible in its
character, and so tenacious of the language of its early inhabitants in
its topography, which such a theory involves.

If the first supposition be the correct one, and the Cruithne spoke
a Gaelic dialect, we can easily understand how, though originally
different from the Gaelic dialect of Dalriada, it may, by the influence
of the written language, and its vernacular use by their clergy for
so long a period, have become modified and assimilated to it; and
if, as is probable, their dialect had been so far cultivated, as the
existence of popular poetry, the first literature of a rude people, was
calculated to effect, the influence of the clergy would probably be
antagonistic to such literature, and be employed to suppress it; and
the language in which it was conveyed might remain for some time in
opposition to the written language, as a vernacular and popular form of
the language, the type and symbol of the anti-Christian party, till it
was finally amalgamated with, or assimilated to it as the party itself
was ultimately overcome.

But another event had taken place during this obscure period, extending
to little more than a century, and in which the union of the two
populations under a Scottish royal race had been effected, which
must have interposed an obstacle to the spread of an influence from
Ireland into the nondalriadic portion of the Highlands, and greatly
counteracted that arising from a dominant royal family of Scottish
descent. This was the destruction of Iona by the Scandinavian pirates,
and their subsequent occupation of the Western Isles and western
seaboard of Scotland. Towards the end of the eighth century, these
hordes of Vikings or sea-robbers, issuing from Norway and Denmark, had
appeared in the western sea, ravaging and plundering the coasts and
islands, and their course was everywhere marked by the burning and
sacking of the monasteries and religious establishments. In 794, the
ravaging of the islands and the destruction of Iona by these Gentiles,
as they were termed, is recorded in the Irish annals. In 802, the
Monastery of Iona was burnt by them, and in 806 the community or family
of Iona, as it was termed, slain, to the number of sixty-eight. In
consequence of the insecurity of Iona, the abbot eventually retired
to Kells, another foundation of St. Columba, and the reliques of St.
Columba were subsequently taken to Ireland, when Derry became the head
of the Columbian houses in Ireland, while a part of the reliques were
removed to Dunkeld, which represented the Columbian clergy in Scotland.
The influence of Iona, as the nucleus and centre of Gaelic learning,
and of its Scottish clergy upon the population of the Highlands, thus
ceased for ever.

The islands were, by degrees, occupied by these pirates, till
eventually the Norwegian Kingdom of Man and the Isles was formed; and
after they had passed over from Paganism to Christianity, and their
power became constituted, the bishopric of the Isles became included in
the Norwegian diocese of Man. During this period, which lasted till the
middle of the twelfth century, while the Western Isles and the western
shores of the mainland were in the occupation of the Norwegians,
and a royal family of Scottish race was on the throne of the united
population, all that remained intact of the Gaelic population of the
Highlands was mainly represented by the great province of Moray, which
contained the mainland part of the modern counties of Inverness and
Ross, and whose chiefs or maormors are found, during the whole of
this period, maintaining a struggle for local independence against
the ruling powers, whether Scottish or Saxon, till they were finally
suppressed in the year 1130 by the great battle in which Angus, the
Celtic Earl of Moray, was defeated and slain by David the First.

The Norwegian Kingdom of Man and the Isles was now approaching its
fall, and a new power arose on the ruins of that of the Maormors of
Moray, which soon became paramount in the Western Highlands, and
exercised a very different influence upon its language and population.
This was the dynasty of the Celtic kings or Lords of the Isles, which
took its rise under Somarled, the founder of the race in the twelfth
century, and maintained a powerful sway in the West Highlands till the
Lord of the Isles was forfeited at the close of the fifteenth century;
and, after several ineffectual attempts to maintain their ground
against the Government, finally fell in the middle of the succeeding
century.

Whether the race of the Lords of the Isles was of Irish descent or not,
is a question which depends upon the precise degree of credibility to
be given to a Celtic pedigree which reaches back to the beginning of
the fourth century; but certain it is, that the spirit and tendency
of the whole race was essentially Irish. The history of Somarled, the
founder of the family, who may, from female connexion, have possessed a
Norwegian name, is quite incompatible with the idea of his representing
a Norwegian house, or deriving his position by inheritance from them.
The names of his father Gillabride, and his grandfather Gillaagamnan,
are purely Celtic. The interest of his family was antagonistic to that
of the Norwegians; their efforts were to supplant and drive them out,
and to elevate a Gaelic kingdom upon their ruins. In the foundation
of this kingdom, Irish aid and Irish interest entered largely, and
the connexion of the family with Ireland became always more and more
closely connected,--an influence and connexion extending to the
powerful Celtic families who rose under their auspices and owned their
sway.

Somarled, the founder of the race, first appears in history as regulus
or petty king of Oirirgaidheal, or, as it is given in the Irish form,
Airergaidheal, and, in the Latin, Argathelia, a name which had sprung
up subsequently to the ninth century, signifying the coast-lands of the
Gael, and embracing the entire west coast from Cowall to Loch Broom.

To this district he must have had hereditary claims; and an ancient
sennachy of the race thus details the steps by which he recovered
possession of it:--

 Gillabride, the son of Gillaagamnan, the son and grandson of the
 Toiseach of Argyll, and descendant of Colla, being amongst his kindred
 in Ireland, the clan Colla, that is, the Macguires and Macmahons, held
 a great meeting and assembly in Fermanagh, the country of Macguire,
 regarding the affairs of Gillabride, how they might restore him to his
 patrimony, from which he had been driven by the power of the Lochlans
 and Finngalls. When Gillabride saw such a large body of men assembled
 together, he besought them to embark in his cause, and to assist the
 people of Alban, who were favourable to him in an attempt to win
 back the possession of the country. The people declared themselves
 willing to go, and four or five hundred put themselves under his
 command. With this company Gillabride proceeded to Alban, and landing
 there, commenced a series of skirmishes and sudden assaults, with
 the assistance of friends, for his name was then very powerful. The
 Lochlans possessed the islands from Man to the Orkneys; but the Gael
 retained possession of the woods and mountains in the districts,
 extending from Dumbarton to Caithness, north of the two oirirs,[23]
 and in Mar. Somarled, the son of Gillabride, was now becoming manly
 and illustrious, and a band attached themselves to him, who had
 possession of the hills and woods of Ardgowar and Morvaren. Here he
 came upon a large army of Lochlans and Fingalls, and assembled round
 him all the soldiers he could muster and the people engaged in herding
 the flocks, and ranged them in order of battle. He practised a great
 deception on his enemies, for he made the same company pass before
 them three times, so that it appeared to them as if there were three
 companies, and then attacked them. The enemy were broken by Somarled
 and fled, till they reached the north bank of the river Shiell, and
 part escaped with their king to the Isles. Somarled did not desist
 from his efforts till he had cleared the whole west side of Alban from
 the Lochlans, except the islands of the Finnlochlans, called Innsegall.

[23] The two oirirs were the Oirir a tuath and the Oirir a deas, which
make up the district known as Oirir Gaedheal, or Oirir Alban, and in
Latin, Argathelia.

Having married the daughter of Olave the Red, the Norwegian king of
Man and the Isles, he succeeded in 1154 in obtaining one-half of
the Western Isles for his eldest son Dougall, the ancestor of the
M‚ÄôDougalls, Lords of Lorn, in right of his mother. The portion of
the Isles thus added to the Gaelic kingdom of Oirirgaidheal were
those south of the point of Ardnamurchan, including Mull, Isla, and
Jura. Ten years afterwards, in 1164, he showed still further his
close relation with Ireland, by placing the Monastery of Iona under
the Abbacy of Derry, and in the same year he was slain in Renfrew,
in an attempt which he made to subvert the Scottish throne itself,
with Irish assistance. His successors remained in possession of this
territory, consisting of Oirirgaidheal, or the western districts,
from Cowall to Loch Broom, and the southern half of the Isles, till
1222, when Alexander the Second took possession of Argathelia, and
annexed the north part of it to the earldom of Ross, and the central
portion to the district of Moray, leaving the districts of Morvaren and
Garwmorvaren, and parts of South Argyll, with the south half of the
Isles, to the descendants of Somarled. On the conquest of the Norwegian
kingdom of Man and the Isles by the King of Scotland in 1266, Skye
and Lewis were annexed to the earldom of Ross, the rest of the Isles
went to Somarled‚Äôs family, their possessions were further increased
by grants from Robert Bruce, and in the end of the fourteenth century
they inherited the possessions of the earldom of Ross, by which they
regained possession of the Oirir a tuath. A petty kingdom was thus
formed, consisting of Argathelia, or the western districts, from Cowall
to Loch Broom and the Western Isles, nominally subordinate to the
Scottish throne, but in reality all powerful among the population of
the Highlands; the clans of the centre and north Highlands, which had
once looked up to the almost equally powerful Maormors of Moray, alone
representing a different interest.

The marriage of the Lord of the Isles, the head of this race, with a
daughter of the great Irish house of O‚ÄôCathan, princes of an extensive
territory in the north of Ireland, towards the close of the thirteenth
century, still further cemented the connexion with Ireland. Tradition
records that twenty-four families followed this lady from Ulster to
the Scottish Highlands, and founded as many houses there, and, in the
subsequent century, a scion of the House of the Isles acquired land in
the north of Ireland, and founded the Antrim family. In all the Irish
wars this race took generally a part, and, in their own wars at home,
were rarely without assistance from Ireland.

The struggle between this great Celtic family and the Crown assumed
an aspect at length which could only terminate in the ruin of the
former or the humiliation of the latter, and at length resulted in
the forfeiture of the Lord of the Isles in 1478, and his subsequent
submission, when he resigned his hereditary Celtic title, and received
in exchange the feudal dignity of Lord of the Isles; a humiliation
which gave deep offence to his subjects, and was not acquiesced in
by them, and produced such internal dissensions, that the Crown took
advantage of them to enforce the final forfeiture of the Lordship
of the Isles in the year 1493. A series of insurrections followed
in favour of the descendants of the forfeited Lord, which finally
terminated in the utter extinction of the kingdom of the Isles in the
year 1545.

During this period, which extends to nearly four centuries, there was
not only a close political connexion between the Western Highlands and
Islands and Ireland, but the literary influence was equally close and
strong; the Irish sennachies and bards were heads of a school which
included the West Highlands, and the Highland sennachies were either
of Irish descent, or, if of native origin, resorted to bardic schools
in Ireland for instruction in the language and the accomplishments of
their art.

The annals of the four masters record the following Irish sennachies as
being recognised masters in the Highlands:--

In 1185 died Maclosa O‚ÄôDaly, ollav, or chief sage or poet of Erin and
Alban; a man illustrious for his poetry, hospitality, and nobility.

In 1328 died the blind O‚ÄôCarril, chief minstrel of Erin and Alban in
his time.

In 1448 died Tadg og, son of Tadg, son of Giollacoluim O‚ÄôHiggin, chief
preceptor of the poets of Erin and Alban.

In 1554 died Tadg, son of Aodh O‚ÄôCoffey, chief teacher of poetry in
Erin and Alban.

The oldest of the Gaelic MSS., preserved in the Library of the Faculty
of Advocates, belong to this period. They are all written in the
Irish character; the language is the written language of Ireland; and
they contain numerous specimens of the poetry of these Irish masters,
especially of Tadg og and the O‚ÄôDalys.

The Betons, or, as their name was in Gaelic, Macbheatha, who were
hereditary physicians in Isla and Mull, and who were also sennachies of
the Macleans, were of Irish descent, being O‚ÄôNeills, and are said by
tradition to be one of the families who accompanied O‚ÄôCathan‚Äôs daughter
to Scotland; and many of these MSS. belonged to them. The M‚ÄôVurichs,
who were hereditary sennachies to Clanranald, were likewise of Irish
descent, and are said ‚Äúto have received their education in Irish
Colleges of poetry and writing.‚Äù[24] Many of these MSS. were compiled
by them; and the earliest are likewise written in the Irish character
and idiom. The sennachies of the other great families, comprised within
the dominions of the Lords of the Isles, appear likewise to have all
resorted to Ireland for instruction and training in their art.

A powerful influence must thus have been exercised upon the language
and literature of the Highlands, which must have become by degrees more
and more assimilated to that of Ireland; and it may well be doubted
whether, towards the close of this period, there existed the means
of acquiring the art of writing the language except in Ireland, or
the conception of a written and cultivated literature, which was not
identified with its language and learning.

[24] Highland Society‚Äôs Report, App. p. 6.

We have no reason, however, to conclude, on that account, that there
was not a vernacular Gaelic, which preserved many of the independent
features of a native language, and existed among the people as a
spoken dialect; or that a popular and unwritten literature may not at
the same time have existed in that native and idiomatic Gaelic in the
poetry handed down by tradition, or composed by native bards, innocent
of all extraneous education in the written language of Ireland. It
is, in fact, in poetry, or rather in popular ballad poetry, that the
nervous and idiomatic vernacular of the people is usually preserved.
Prose readily assimilates itself and succumbs to the influence of a
cultivated and written language, but the tyranny of rhythm and metre
preserves the language in which poetry is composed in its original form
and idiom.[25]

The fall of the great House of the Isles was coincident with another
event, destined to effect a great change in the position of the
Highland population and of their literature. This was the Reformation
of the sixteenth century and its attendant events, the establishment of
a Reformed Church, the introduction of printing, and the translation of
the Scriptures and religious works for the instruction of the people.

From this source sprung up a religious literature, which, commencing in
the written or Irish Gaelic, gradually approached nearer and nearer to
the spoken dialect of the country, and, accompanied by the preaching of
the clergy in the vernacular dialect, tended to preserve and stereotype
the language spoken in the Highlands in its native form and idiom.

[25] Prose originally written in a vernacular dialect readily adapts
itself to the changes in the language, or passes into a new and
cultivated form of it; but not so ballad poetry. The poems of Burns,
for instance, could not be written in English without sacrificing, to a
great extent, the rhyme and cadence of the verses, and almost entirely
their nerve and power.

The first printed book was a translation of the Form of Prayer issued
by John Knox, which was made by John Carsewell, the Protestant Bishop
of the Isles, and printed at ‚ÄúDunedin darab comhainm Dunmonaidh,‚Äù that
is, at Dunedin or Edinburgh, otherwise called Dunmonaidh, 24th April
1567. Bishop Carsewell was a native of Kilmartin, in the southern part
of the country of Argyll. He prefixes to his translation an address,
which is written in the Irish orthography, and in the pure Irish or
written dialect. In it he says, that ‚Äúwe, the Gael of Alban and Erin,
have laboured under the want that our dialects of the Gaelic have never
been printed;‚Äù and he alludes to the dialects of the language and to
the manuscript literature then existing, ‚Äúwritten in manuscript books
in the compositions of poets and ollaos, and in the remains of learned
men,‚Äù and characterizes them not unjustly as full of ‚Äúlying, worldly
stories concerning the Tuatha de Dannan, the sons of Milesius, the
heroes, and Finn mac Cumhal with his Feine.‚Äù

The second printed book was a translation of Calvin‚Äôs Catechism, which
was published, along with an English edition, in 1631. This translation
seems likewise to have been made in Argyllshire, and is in the Irish
orthography and idiom.

In 1659, the Presbyterian Synod of Argyll took up the work of issuing
translations into Gaelic of the metrical Psalms and of the Scriptures,
and commenced with a portion of the Psalter, which was completed in
1694. This also is in the Irish dialect; but, in 1753, an amended
version was published by the Rev. Alexander Macfarlane, minister of
Kilninver and Kilmelford, who had previously, in 1750, published a
translation into Gaelic of Baxter‚Äôs Call to the Unconverted, adapted to
the Gaelic of the central and north Highlands; and, in 1787, another
version was issued by Dr. J. Smith, minister of Kilbrandon, and
afterwards of Campbelltown, who had in 1781 translated Alleine‚Äôs Alarm
into Gaelic, and in this version the north country words and Irishisms
were thrown out, and the metre suited to the west country dialect; and,
finally, in 1807, an edition of the Psalter was published by Thomas
Ross for the use of the northern districts, in which the Irish words,
unintelligible to them, are explained at the bottom of the page by
synonymous words used in that part of the Highlands.

In 1690, the first Bible was published for the use of the Highlands. It
was simply an edition of the Irish version of the Bible, by the Rev.
Robert Kirke, minister of Balquhidder, to which he appended a short
vocabulary.

In 1767, the first translation of the New Testament was published.
It was translated by the Rev. James Stewart of Killin. It was then
considered as pure Scotch Gaelic, and free from Irish idiom; and, in
1796, it was revised and altered by his son, Dr. Stewart of Luss. In
1783, a translation of the Old Testament was undertaken by the Society
for Propagating Christian Knowledge in Scotland, and completed in 1787,
and various editions subsequently appeared. In 1816, a memorial was
presented to the General Assembly of the Church, urging the necessity
of a final revision of the Gaelic Scriptures, and a committee of the
best Gaelic scholars appointed to superintend it, under whose auspices
an amended edition was published of the Old Testament in 1820, and
of the whole Scriptures in 1826, which may now be considered as the
standard of the orthography and idiom of the Scotch Gaelic.

It will be seen that the earlier printed books emanated entirely from
Argyllshire, where the spoken dialect approaches more nearly to the
Irish; and the work of translating and publishing the Psalter and
Scriptures into Gaelic being a new and difficult task, the translators
resorted to Ireland and to the written and cultivated dialect of the
Irish as the medium through which to convey it; but as subsequent
editions were issued, they were brought more and more near to the
spoken language of the Scotch Highlands in its purest form and idiom,
and the Irish orthography by degrees adapted to it, till at length the
Scotch Gaelic became clothed in that orthography in which we now find
it, and elevated to the position of a written and cultivated language.

Throughout the whole of this period, however, there existed, side by
side with this printed religious literature, another literature in
the popular poetry of the uncultivated native bards, removed from the
influence of Irish training, whose compositions were expressed in the
pure idiom of the spoken dialect; and in the poems of Ian Lom, the
Lochaber poet of the Wars of Montrose; Duncan Ban Macintyre, whose
exquisite poem of Bendoran is a beautiful specimen of pure Gaelic, and
whose poems were printed in 1778; Ailen Buidhe Macdougall, W. Ross,
and Allan Dall Macdougall--all natives of the central districts of the
Highlands,--we find ample evidence of the existence and character of
a vernacular dialect, in which the people interchanged their homely
ideas, and their favourite bards composed their poems which found an
immediate access to the hearts and imagination of the people; while the
language in which their scriptures and formularies were conveyed was
looked upon as a sort of sacred dialect, through which they received
their religious teaching.

There was thus, throughout, a double influence exercised upon the
language and literature of the Highlands. One from Ireland, which was
associated with the written and cultivated dialect of Gaelic which had
there been formed, and brought over with Christianity to Scotland. With
it came the Irish orthography. It was mainly connected with learning
and religious teaching, and its influence was most powerful in the
western districts and islands, and the territories subject to the power
of the Lord of the Isles. The other, indigenous and antagonistic to it,
falling back upon a literary influence from the south and east, when
not predominant, and associated more with the popular poetry of the
Highlands. Its orthography seems to have resembled that of the other
Celtic languages, the Welsh and the Manx; and its influence prevailed
in the central and north Highlands, where the best and purest type of
the Scotch Gaelic is still to be found.[26]

[26] Mr. Donald Macintosh, the Keeper of the Highland Society‚Äôs MSS.,
in his list of MSS. then existing in Scotland in 1806, mentions
that ‚ÄúMr. Matheson of Fernaig has a paper MS., written in the Roman
character, and in an _orthography like that of the Dean of Lismore_,
containing songs and hymns, some by Bishop Carsewell.‚Äù This MS. has not
been recovered; but if we had it, we might find that, while the Bishop
resorted to Ireland for his prose translation of Knox‚Äôs Liturgy, his
original poetry was in a different dialect and orthography.

The literary history of the Highlands falls into periods as these
influences respectively prevailed.

The first period is prior to the seventh century, when there was
no political separation between Ireland and Gaelic Scotland. The
great divisions of the people were regulated by race rather than by
geographical distribution. The Cruithne everywhere were united by
common origin and ties of race; and the Scots, wherever settled, owned
the Milesian Ardrigh in Ireland. The countries were simply viewed
as the east and the west, and were known as Erin and Alban, and the
communication between them was free and unrestrained. The second period
commences with the separation of the Scotch Dalriada from the Irish in
573, and of the Irish Cruithne from the present race, some thirty years
later, when a political as well as a geographical separation between
the Celtic tribes of the two countries took place; but, for upwards
of a century afterwards, the church and clergy of the Highlands were
Irish, and the written Irish dialect imported by them must still have
remained in use, and exercised its accustomed influence on the spoken
language.

After the expulsion of the Scotch clergy in 717, a period of great
obscurity in the history of Scotland occurs, extending to nearly a
century and a half, during which the ecclesiastical influence exercised
was from the south, taking its origin from the Anglic kingdom of
Northumbria; some revolution also took place, which placed a Scottish
royal family upon the throne of a kingdom consisting of the united
tribes situated to the north of the Forth and Clyde. But during the
same period another event took place, of great significance in the
literary history of the country; the Monastery of Icholumkill or
Iona, the time-honoured seat of Gaelic learning, went down amidst the
troubled waters of Scandinavian piracy, and its position, as head of
the learning and religion of the country, was gone for ever.

During the fourth period, which lasted for three hundred years, the
Norwegian kingdom of Man and the Isles, which likewise embraced the
western seaboard of the Highlands, interposed itself between the
Highlands and Ireland; and the influence from the latter country must
for the time have been paralysed, while the indigenous and native
influence maintained itself in the extensive Highland province of Moray.

At the close of this period we have a hint of the existence of an
Albanic dialect of Gaelic in the Life of St. Kentigern, first Bishop
of Glasgow, by Jocelyn, the biographer also of St. Patrick, who wrote
in the year 1180. He says that the name of Kentigern was justly given
to one who might be called their dominus capitaneus; ‚Äúnam _ken_ caput
Latine, _tyern Albanice_, dominus Latine interpretatur.‚Äù This is nearly
a phonetic orthography, and not unlike that of the Dean of Lismore‚Äôs
MS. In Irish orthography the words would be _cend_, signifying caput,
or a head; _tigerna_, dominus, or lord; but in pronunciation the _d_ in
_cend_ is quiescent, and the aspirated _g_ in _tigerna_, so that the
sound is exactly represented even as now pronounced. Jocelyn seems to
recognise the existence of a native dialect designated by _Albanice_;
and one of the peculiarities of Scotch Gaelic is also present in the
omission of the final _a_ from the word _tigerna_.[27]

[27] In the older life of St. Kentigern, written prior to 1164, it is
said that Servanus, at Culross, when he heard of Kentigern‚Äôs birth,
exclaimed, ‚Äú_A dia cur fir sin_, quod sonat Latine O utinam sic esset.‚Äù
In modern Scotch Gaelic the phrase would be, _A dhia gur fior sin_.

The fate of the great Celtic earldom of Moray, and the decay of the
Norwegian power in the Isles, was followed by the powerful sway of the
Celtic Lords of the Isles, who, during the fifth period, extending from
three to four centuries, were dominant in the western districts; and,
as far as their sway extended, the spirit, influence, and literature
were all Irish, and it was only when the fall of the almost independent
kingdom of the Isles, and the Reformation again separated the country
from Ireland, that a reaction towards the vernacular and spoken Scotch
Gaelic took place, which has resulted in a clear development of its
grammatical rules and construction, and the establishment of a fixed
orthography.

It was at the close of the fifth period, during which the Lords of the
Isles were all-powerful in the west, and just before the middle of the
sixteenth century ushered in the Reformation, that the collection,
of which selections are now published, was made by the Vicar of
Fortingal, who was also Dean of Lismore. It is a collection, formed
upwards of three hundred years ago, from all quarters, and presents
to us a specimen of the literature which was current in the Highlands
during this period. There are poems by the Irish bards, whose schools
extended also to the Highlands, by the O‚ÄôDalys, who lived during the
fifteenth century; by Teague og O‚ÄôHiggin, who died in 1448; by Dermod
O‚ÄôHiffernan; and by Turn O‚ÄôMeilchonair, Ollav of the Sil Murray, who
died in 1468. There are poems by Allan M‚ÄôRuadrie and Gillecallum Mac
an Olla, who seem to have been native bards; by John of Knoydart, who
celebrates the murder of the young Lord of the Isles by his Irish
harper in 1490; by Finlay M‚ÄôNab, called the Good Poet; and by the
transcriber of the greater part of the manuscript, Duncan, the Dean‚Äôs
brother, who wrote in praise of the M‚ÄôGregors.

The great value of this collection, as regards the language, arises
from the peculiar orthography used, which presents it as it must have
been pronounced, and affords a means of testing one of the chief
differences which characterize the different provincial dialects, the
vowel and consonantal sounds, and the presence or absence of eclipsis
and aspiration.

It has been found impossible to print the whole of the contents of the
MS., but the selection which has been made, chiefly with reference to
the literature of the Highlands, will also afford a fair specimen of
the shades of difference which characterized the language in which
the poems are written. Some are in pure Irish, and must have been
transferred from the Irish orthography into that used in the MS. Others
are in pure Scotch Gaelic, as the poems of Duncan, son of Dougall Maol,
Finlay M‚ÄôNab, the bard roy, and John of Knoydart. Others are in a
mixed dialect, in some of which the Irish idiom, in others the Scotch,
predominates.

In general, it will be found that the language approaches more or less
nearly to the Irish, as the writers appear to have had more or less
cultivation in the written language, or were more or less removed from
Irish influence; and the MS. may be viewed as the only known record
of those vernacular dialects of Gaelic in the sixteenth century which
differed in any degree from the written and cultivated language.

But while the Dean of Lismore‚Äôs MS. has in this respect a philological
value, it has likewise no mean literary value, from the circumstance
that it contains no fewer than twenty-eight Ossianic poems, extending
to upwards of 2500 lines, nine directly attributed to Ossian, two to
Farris or Ferghus Filidh, and one to Caolte M‚ÄôRonan, the three bards of
the Feine; two to Allan M‚ÄôRuadri, and one to Gillecallum Mac an Olla,
bards hitherto unknown; and eleven poems, Ossianic in their style and
subject, to which no author‚Äôs name is attached.

The circumstances under which the controversy regarding the
authenticity of the poems of Ossian, published by James Macpherson,
arose, and the extent to which it for the time agitated the minds of
the _literati_ of England and Scotland, are well known.

In the summer of 1759, Mr. John Home, the author of Douglas, met Mr.
James Macpherson, then a tutor in the family of Graham of Balgowan,
at Moffat. Mr. Home had previously been told by Professor Adam
Fergusson, a native of Atholl, and acquainted with Gaelic, that there
existed in the country some remains of ancient Gaelic poetry. Mr. Home
mentioned the circumstance to James Macpherson, also a Highlander, and
a native of Badenoch, and was told by him that he had some pieces of
ancient Gaelic poetry in his possession. After some difficulty, Mr.
Home obtained translations of them from Macpherson, and took them to
Edinburgh, and showed the translations to Drs. Blair, Fergusson, and
Robertson, by whom they were much admired. Macpherson was importuned
to translate all he had, and the translations furnished by him
were published in a little volume in June 1760, under the title of
‚ÄúFragments of Ancient Poetry collected in the Highlands of Scotland.‚Äù

There seems little reason to doubt that these translations were
made from genuine fragments in Macpherson‚Äôs possession. If they
existed at all, they were in his possession before any talk had
arisen of translating Gaelic poetry. There was no pretext of going
to the Highlands to collect them. There was no idea, at the time the
translations were produced, that such poetry could have any value in
the eyes of the literary world, and there seems no motive for any
deception. In the fragments, or rather short poems, contained in this
little work, the proper names are smoothed down from their original
Gaelic form to suit English ears; and Macpherson had already hit upon
that happy prose version, the conception of which has great merit,
and had no little share in the popularity which immediately attached
to them; but, in other respects, they have every appearance of having
been translations from short Gaelic poems which really existed. The
admiration which they excited in the minds of men of the great literary
reputation of Home, Blair, Fergusson, and Robertson, must have first
astonished, and then greatly flattered, a man of the disposition of
Macpherson. He was urged to undertake a journey to the Highlands,
to collect all that remained of poetry of this description, and a
subscription was raised to defray the expense. This proposal must
have raised a prospect sufficiently dazzling before the poor Highland
tutor, who seemed likely to exchange a life of poverty, obscurity,
and irksome duty, for one of comparative independence and literary
fame; and he acceded to it with affected reluctance. At that time,
anything like that spirit of severe and critical antiquarianism,
which attaches the chief value to the relics of past ages from their
being genuine fragments of a past literature, and demands a rigid and
literal adherence to the form and shape in which they are found, was
totally unknown. That feeling is the creation of subsequent times. At
that time literary excellence was mainly looked to, their authority
was usually taken on trust, and it was thought that the claims of
such criticism were sufficiently satisfied when the remains of the
past were woven into an elegant and flowing narrative. With Homer and
other classical epics before him, such a proposal as the publication
of the ancient poetry of the Highlands, assuming, as we now know to be
the fact, that Ossianic poetry of some kind did exist, and looking to
the high expectations formed, must have at once suggested to him the
idea that he should not do justice to the task he had undertaken if
he could not likewise produce a Gaelic epic. This idea seems early to
have suggested itself to Macpherson‚Äôs mind; it is obscurely hinted at
in the preface to the Fragments; and Macpherson seems to have started
on his tour with the preconceived determination to view any short poems
and fragments he might find as parts of longer poems, and, if possible,
by welding them together, to produce a national epic which should do
honour to his country, and confirm his own reputation as its recoverer
and translator. He was accompanied, in the earlier part of his journey,
by a countryman of his own, Mr. Lachlan Macpherson of Strathmashie,
who was a better Gaelic scholar than he was himself, and an excellent
Gaelic poet. It is certain that, in this tour, a number of MSS. were
collected by them, and poetry taken down from recitation; and that he
was joined in it by another Gaelic scholar, Captain Alexander Morrison,
who likewise assisted him. On his return, he proceeded to Badenoch,
his native place and that of Lachlan Macpherson, and here he remained
till January 1761, engaged, with the assistance of Lachlan Macpherson
and Alexander Morrison, in preparing the materials for the next
publication of Ossian; and then proceeded to Edinburgh, from whence
he writes to the Rev. James M‚ÄôLagan, in a letter dated 16th January
1761,--‚ÄúI have been lucky enough to lay my hands on a pretty complete
poem, and truly epic, concerning Fingal.... I have some thoughts of
publishing the original, if it will not clog the work too much.‚Äù

His task, whatever it was, had then been accomplished; and after
remaining some time in Edinburgh, engaged in preparing the English
version for the press, he went to London, and early in 1762 issued a
quarto volume, containing the epic poem of Fingal, in six books, and
sixteen other poems. In the following year another quarto appeared,
containing another epic poem in eight books, called Temora, and five
other poems. This volume also contained what was called ‚Äúa specimen of
the original of Temora,‚Äù being a Gaelic version of the seventh book,
and the only Gaelic bearing to be the original of any of the poems
which appeared.

The English version, contained in these two quartos, possessed the same
character as the English of the Fragments; the same accommodation of
the Gaelic proper names to the supposed requirements of English ears,
and the prose style, originated by Macpherson, sustained with equal
spirit; the poems, however, were longer, and more elaborate.

The literary public, who had welcomed the Fragments with admiration,
received the volume containing the epic of Fingal with startled but
silent acquiescence, and exploded under the eight books of Temora. It
seemed incredible that poems such as these could have been handed down
by oral recitation from the supposed age of Ossian; the refined manners
described, and the allusions to the Roman Emperors, awakened suspicion,
and a storm of adverse criticism and questioning incredulity arose, in
which Dr. Johnson--at that time in the zenith of his reputation--took
the lead.

Macpherson, who found the fair breeze of flattery and laudation,
before which he had been sailing so smoothly on his heavy quartos,
without a suspicion that he had not attained the full success he
aimed at, so suddenly changed into an adverse storm of criticism and
depreciation, knew not how to meet the crisis. He had not courage to
avow the truth, and state candidly to the world how much of his work
was based on original authority, and to what extent he had carried the
process of adapting, interpolating, and weaving into epic poems. He
took refuge first in sulky silence, and eventually seemed to find a
sort of compensation for his denunciation, as a detected forger, in the
necessary alternative, the credit of having been a successful composer,
and by half hints encouraged that view.[28]

[28] In 1778 and 1780 a collection of Ossianic poems, in the original
Gaelic, was made by Duncan Kennedy, schoolmaster. His MS. collection
was purchased by the Highland Society, and is now in the collection of
MSS. in the Advocates‚Äô Library. There is appended to it a list of the
persons from whose recitations the poems were taken down.

In 1780, Dr. Smith, of Campbellton, published a quarto volume, entitled
Gaelic Antiquities, containing versions in English of poems attributed
to Ossian, Ullin, etc.; and in 1787 the originals were published under
the title of Sean Dana.

Unhappily, Dr. Smith, instead of publishing the poems as he got
them, with a literal English version, was ambitious of shining, like
Macpherson, as an editor of Ossian, and of sharing in his notoriety;
but the poems of the latter had already lost their lustre, and Smith
did not possess the wonderful tact and originality Macpherson really
showed in producing his English version, and which alone made them
bearable; his version was diffuse, heavy, and turgid, and his book fell
dead from the press.

The Sean Dana showed that he had largely made use of Kennedy‚Äôs
collection.

Kennedy, with the strange desire that all of these collectors of
Ossianic poems showed to be supposed capable of composing them, and
thus to acquire literary credit at the expense of their honesty, laid
claim to the authorship of part of them, and furnished the Highland
Society with a statement of those parts of the poems he had really
taken down from recitation, and those he claimed to have composed.

It is strange that the passages he claimed as his own composition are
just those which have been most clearly established to be genuine.

Thus, lines which Kennedy marked as his own composition, are found
_verbatim_ in the Dean‚Äôs MS.

I believe that there was little or no truth in Kennedy‚Äôs assertion,
which was dictated by vanity, and that his collection is, on the whole,
genuine.

The journey which Dr. Johnson took to the Hebrides, in order to examine
the question, and of his Journal of which, one passage seems to have
adhered to men‚Äôs recollections almost as pertinaciously as that of
Ossian‚Äôs Address to the Sun did to the Highland reciters of his
poems--the celebrated description of Iona--was not likely to do much in
the way of solving the question.

A man of the obstinate prejudices and overbearing temper of Dr.
Johnson, with a firm belief that no Ossianic poems really existed, and
that Gaelic was not a written language, with an entire ignorance of
that language, and a colossal reputation as a critic, bursting suddenly
among the frightened Highland ministers, who believed in him, and
trembled before him, could hardly return with any other result than
that he had found no poems of Ossian, and no one bold enough to avow,
in his presence, that he believed in their existence; and most men now
subsided into the conviction that the whole thing was an imposture, an
opinion embodied and elaborately worked out by Malcolm Laing.

This led to the Highland Society of Scotland undertaking an inquiry
into the authenticity of the poems of Ossian published by Macpherson,
which involved the subsidiary inquiry of whether such poems existed
in the Highlands in the original Gaelic. The result of this inquiry
is contained in the elaborate report prepared by Henry Mackenzie, the
author of the Man of Feeling, and published in 1806.

The inquiry was conducted with much candour. The committee were aided
by receiving from Mr. John Mackenzie, Secretary of the Highland Society
of London, and executor of Mr. James Macpherson, all the Gaelic MSS.
in his possession, including those which Macpherson had left behind
him; and they resorted to every means within their reach to obtain
information.

The whole of the materials for forming a judgment which they had
collected were placed impartially before the public; and the subject,
so far as such materials then existed or were at their command, is
really exhausted by this report.

The committee were cautious in giving an opinion, but the result they
arrived at seems to have been--

_1st_, That the characters introduced into Macpherson‚Äôs poems were not
invented, but were really the subjects of tradition in the Highlands;
and that poems certainly existed which might be called Ossianic, as
relating to the persons and events of that mythic age.

_2d_, That such poems, though usually either entire poems of no very
great length, or fragments, had been handed down from an unknown
period by oral recitation, and that there existed many persons in the
Highlands who could repeat them.

_3d_, That such poems had likewise been committed to writing, and were
to be found to some extent in MSS.

_4th_, That Macpherson had used many such poems in his work; but by
joining separated pieces together, and by adding a connecting narrative
of his own, had woven them into longer poems, and into the so-called
epics.

No materials existed, however, to show the extent to which this process
had been carried, and the amount of genuine matter the poems, as
published by Macpherson, contained.[29]

[29] A comparison of the poems in the Fragments, with those in the
first quarto, containing the epic of Fingal, shows indications of the
mode in which Macpherson dealt with his materials.

There are sixteen poems in the Fragments, all short; and some bearing
the usual mark of a complete poem, by the first line being repeated at
the end.

Thus, the second fragment begins with the sentence, ‚ÄúI sit by the mossy
fountain; on the top of the hill of winds.‚Äù And the same expression is
introduced at the end--‚ÄúBy the mossy fountain I will sit; on the top of
the hill of winds;‚Äù marking a complete poem.

The first and fourth fragments we find in the quarto volume, containing
Fingal, forming part of a longer poem termed Carrickthura, and here
they are joined together by intermediate passages of some length,
evidently interpolated by Macpherson.

The sixth and twelfth fragments contain dialogues between the poet
and the son of Alpine. This was no doubt, in the original, the usual
dialogue between Ossian and Patrick, always called in Scotch Gaelic
poems Macalpine. The sixth fragment appears also in the quarto, in
the so-called Epic of Fingal; but the dialogue is omitted, and the
translation greatly altered.

To the fourteenth fragment there is appended the following note:--‚ÄúThis
is the opening of the epic poem mentioned in the preface. The two
following fragments are parts of some episodes of the same work,‚Äù and
they accordingly appear in the quarto, in the epic poem of Fingal.

The fourteenth fragment, however, relates to Cuchullin alone; and in
those tales and poems which we know to be genuine, Cuchullin and Fingal
are never brought together.

Macpherson seems, at this stage of his collection, to have conceived
the idea of weaving the short poems into one epic; but his unskilful
junction of Cuchullin and Fingal in the same transactions, betrays its
artificial construction.

Such was the result to which the committee appeared to come, and which
may fairly be deduced from this inquiry; all intelligent inquirers
seemed now to adopt this result, and the unbiassed public generally
acquiesced in it,--the only difference of opinion being as to the
greater or less extent to which Macpherson carried his process of
adaptation and amalgamation.

The publication in 1806 of what was called the original Gaelic of
Ossian, did not affect this conclusion, or tend to alter the general
acquiescence of the public in it. Instead of consisting of genuine
extracts from old MSS., or copies of pieces taken down from oral
recitation, it proved to be a complete version in Gaelic poetry of the
English version transcribed under James Macpherson‚Äôs eye, and left by
him in a state for publication. It was a smooth and polished version
in Gaelic verse of the entire poems, in the same shape as they were
presented in English, and written in the modern Gaelic of that time.

It is very difficult, however, to believe that this Gaelic version had
been composed subsequently to the publication of the English Ossian,
and translated from it. To any one capable, from a knowledge of Gaelic,
of judging, such a theory seems almost impossible; and it is difficult
to acquiesce in it. A review of all the circumstances which have been
allowed to transpire regarding the proceedings of James Macpherson,
seems rather to lead to the conclusion that the Gaelic version, in
the shape in which it was afterwards published, had been prepared in
Badenoch, during the months Macpherson passed there, after his return
from his Highland tour, with the assistance of Lachlan Macpherson of
Strathmashie, and Captain Morrison, and that the English translation
was made from it by Macpherson in the same manner in which he had
translated the fragments,--a conclusion which is the more probable, as,
while James Macpherson‚Äôs acquaintance with the language seems not to
have been sufficiently complete to qualify him for such a task, there
appears to be no doubt of the Laird of Strathmashie‚Äôs perfect ability
to accomplish it.[30]

[30] Some years ago I happened to pass a couple of months in the
immediate neighbourhood of Strathmashie, and I recollect having been
informed at that time, but by whom I cannot now tell, that, after
Lachlan Macpherson‚Äôs death, a paper was found in his repositories
containing the Gaelic of the seventh book of Temora, in his
handwriting, with numerous corrections and alterations, with this
title,--‚ÄúFirst rude draft of the seventh book of Temora.‚Äù

Mr. Gallie sent to the Highland Society a part of the Gaelic of Fingal,
which afterwards appeared in the Gaelic version subsequently published.
He said he had taken it from a MS. he had recovered, written by a
friend ‚Äúwho was at that time with Mr. Macpherson and me, a gentleman
well known for an uncommon acquaintance with the Gaelic, and a happy
facility for writing it in Roman characters.‚Äù

On being pressed to say who this friend was, he says, ‚Äúhis name was
Lachlane Macpherson of Strathmashy. He died in 1767.‚Äù

This Gaelic version seems, therefore, to have been put together before
1767; and if before 1762, it will account for the original of the
seventh book of Temora having been published in that year, and also
for an advertisement which appeared soon after the publication of the
second quarto, that the originals were lying at the publisher‚Äôs, and
would be published if a sufficient number of subscribers came forward;
but as few subscribers appeared, and fewer came to look at them, they
were withdrawn.

The so-called originals were, no doubt, this Gaelic version, which
there is every reason to believe had preceded the English version in
its preparation.

But while from this date the controversy in England may be said to
have terminated, with the exception of an occasional reproduction of
old arguments and of criticism long superseded, by enthusiastic young
Highlanders, and occasional discussions at young debating societies, it
broke out from a new quarter, and in a different shape.

The Irish, who had been long murmuring under the neglect of their
claims to literary notice, and the absorbing attention obtained by
the Highlands, suddenly burst forth with a succession of violent and
spasmodic attacks, of which the partial detection of the Ossian of
Macpherson afforded a favourable opportunity.

In 1784 Dr. Young, afterwards Bishop of Clonfert, a good Irish scholar,
had made a tour in the Highlands, with the view of collecting Gaelic
poems, and ascertaining from what materials Macpherson had constructed
his Ossian. He published an account of his journey in the first volume
of the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, in which he maintained
that any poems that existed were Irish, and that Macpherson had founded
his Ossian on some of these, ‚Äúretrenching, adding, and altering as he
judged proper.‚Äù

In 1789 a collection of Irish Ossianic poems was published by Miss
Brooke, termed Reliques of Irish Poetry. They consisted of short
poems, either attributed to Ossian or on Ossianic subjects, and
were accompanied by the original Irish version from which they were
translated. Where that was obtained is not stated.

In 1807 the Dublin Gaelic Society was formed, for the purpose of
publishing the contents of Irish MSS.; and in the only volume of
transactions published, the subject of Ossian was taken up. The prose
tale of Deirdre, the original of Macpherson‚Äôs Darthula, interspersed
with fragments of poetry, is there given; and the volume likewise
contains strictures upon Macpherson, in which his work is boldly
denounced as an entire fabrication and imposture from beginning to end,
and the assertion made, that no poems of Ossian ever existed in Gaelic
except those in Ireland.

In 1827 the Royal Irish Academy offered a prize for the best essay
on the poems of Ossian. The subject proposed was ‚Äúto investigate the
authenticity of the poems of Ossian, both as given in Macpherson‚Äôs
translation and as published in Gaelic (London, 1807), under the
sanction of the Highland Society of London.‚Äù The prize was awarded in
1829 to Dr. Drummond, their librarian, whose essay is published in the
sixteenth volume of their Transactions. In this essay the arguments of
Dr. Johnson and Malcolm Laing are adopted; and the assertion of the
former is re-echoed, that ‚Äúthere does not exist in the whole Highlands
a person who can repeat one poem of Macpherson‚Äôs Ossian.‚Äù Another
essay, given in by Edward O‚ÄôReilly, the author of an Irish dictionary
of no great repute, is printed in continuation of Dr. Drummond‚Äôs, also
asserting the modern fabrication of the whole of the poems published by
Macpherson, and that the Gaelic poems of Macpherson contain in them the
substance stolen from Irish poems.

In 1853 a society was formed in Dublin, ‚Äúwhose object should be the
publication of Fenian poems, tales, and romances illustrative of the
Fenian period of Irish history, in the Irish language and character,
with literal translations and notes explanatory of the text.‚Äù This
society was termed the Ossianic Society, and they have already issued
six volumes of Transactions.

In the fifth volume there is an essay on the poems of Ossian by
Macpherson, which may be considered as a summary of the case of Ireland
against Scotland as to these poems.

This essay is, like the others, violent in language and uncandid
in spirit. It deals with the controversy as it existed in the last
century, and its strength consists in simply ignoring altogether the
inquiry made by the Highland Society of Scotland, the whole of the
great mass of facts collected by them being passed over in silence, and
in imputing to the Scots of the present day the views and feelings of
those of a century back, before the rise of a true spirit of historic
inquiry and genuine criticism had led them to a just appreciation of
their national history, and of the claims of Macpherson‚Äôs Ossian to be
viewed as an authentic work.

The publications of the Dublin Gaelic Society and of the Ossianic
Society have, however, not merely assailed the Ossian of Macpherson as
a fabrication, and denied to Scotland the possession of any Ossianic
poems whatever; they have at length given to the world those genuine
Ossianic poems alleged to exist solely in Ireland.

The former contains the prose tale of Deirdre, interspersed with short
poems. The latter have presented to the public a number of poems in the
original Irish, with literal translations. The first volume contains
a poem extending to no fewer than 180 quatrains, termed the Battle of
Gabhra, to which is added a short poem termed the Rosg Catha of Oscar
son of Ossian; but, strangely enough, though there is an elaborate
introduction, no hint is given of where the originals of these poems
were obtained. The second volume, besides a short poem given in a
long and elaborate introduction, contains a prose tale called the
Festivities of the House of Conan of Ceann-sleibhe; and in this volume,
for the first time, the source from which this tale and the poem in the
previous volume was taken is stated. They are from a MS. collection
made by a celebrated scribe named Foran, who resided at Portland, in
the county of Waterford, in the year 1780, that is, twenty years after
Macpherson had published his Ossian.

The third volume contains a long prose tale, interspersed with poetry,
termed the Pursuit of Diarmaid and Grainne; another prose tale, termed
How Cormac mac Art got his Branch; and a poem, termed the Lamentation
of Oisin after the Feinne. And the sources of these tales are stated
to be--_1st_, The collection made by Laurence Foran in 1780, termed
Bolg an tsalathar; and _2dly_, A closely written quarto of 881 pages,
from the pen of Martan O‚ÄôGriobhta or Martin Griffin, an intelligent
blacksmith of Kilrush, in the county of Clare, 1842-43, called an
Sgeulaidhe, and containing thirty-eight Fenian and other legends, some
of which are said to have been transcribed from MSS. of 1749.[31]

The fourth volume contains ten poems, which, with the exception of two,
were taken from the collection of 1780, from another collection made in
1812 by the Rev. Thomas Hill of Cooreclure, and from the volume of the
intelligent blacksmith in 1844.

The fifth volume contains a long prose tale termed the Proceedings
of the Great Bardic Institution, an essay on the poems of Ossian,
published by Macpherson, and several short poems which are ancient, but
not Ossianic.

And the sixth and last contains nine Ossianic poems, which are stated
to be taken from Foran‚Äôs collection in 1780, from that of Mr. Hill in
1812, and from the intelligent blacksmith of 1844.

No information whatever is given as to the sources from whence these
respectable collectors obtained their poems; they are all posterior
to the publication of Ossian‚Äôs poems by Macpherson; and, so far as we
are yet informed by the Irish editors, the Ossianic poems published
by them stand in no better position in regard to their antiquity or
authenticity than those of Macpherson.[32]

[31] In vol. iv. p. 230 of these Transactions, it is admitted that some
of the poems transcribed in 1749 were the composition of the writer,
Michael Comyn.

[32] Those poems published by the Ossianic Society which are of any
length, and especially the poem termed the Battle of Gabhra, show
evident indications of the same process of patching and dovetailing
together of shorter poems which characterize Macpherson‚Äôs Ossian.

Professor O‚ÄôCurry, in his valuable lectures on Irish literature,
with that scrupulous accuracy which always distinguishes him, admits
that there exists in Ireland only eleven Ossianic poems prior to the
fifteenth century--seven ascribed to Fionn himself, two to his son
Oisin, one to Fergus Filidh, and one to Caoilte. Most of these are
extremely short, and are found principally in the book of Leinster,
supposed to be compiled in the twelfth century, and in the book of
Lecan in the fifteenth.

The theory, that Macpherson stole his poems directly from Ireland,
is obviously untenable and inconsistent with all that we know of
his proceedings, for he never was there, and had apparently no
communication with Irishmen, or access to their MSS. What he obtained,
he got in the Highlands of Scotland, and the collection of poems made
by the Dean of Lismore and his brother tends to confirm the result
which had been attained by the inquiry made by the Highland Society
of Scotland, for it contains poems attributed directly to Ossian and
others which may be called Ossianic, collected in the Highlands of
Scotland upwards of three hundred years ago. The persons named, and the
subjects, are of the same character with those in Macpherson, and such
poems must have been handed down by oral recitation, as many of the
poems obtained from recitation during the Highland Society‚Äôs inquiry
are the same as those in this MS.

Assuming, then, that Ossianic poems existed in the Highlands of
Scotland, and were both preserved by oral tradition, and transcribed
in MS. collections, the question arises, What is their real position
in the literature of the Highlands? and this question leads to a
preliminary question which will materially aid its solution.

Who were the Feinne of tradition, and to what country and period are
they to be assigned?

To this question the Irish historians give a ready response.

They were a body of Irish militia, forming a kind of standing army,
employed for the purpose of defending the coasts of Ireland from the
invasion of foreign foes. They were billeted upon the inhabitants
during winter, and obliged to maintain themselves by hunting and
fishing during summer. Each of the four provinces had its band of these
warriors, termed Curaidhe or champions. Those of Ulster were termed the
Curaidhe na Craoibh Ruaidhe, or champions of the red branch, and were
stationed at Eamhain or Eamania, near Ulster. To this body belonged the
celebrated Cuchullin and the sons of Uisneach. The militia of Connaught
were the Curaidhe or champions of Jorras Domnan, otherwise called the
Clanna Morna, to which belonged Goll Mac Morn, stationed at Dun Domnan,
in Mayo. The militia of Munster were the Curaidhe Clann Deaghadh, to
which belonged Curigh Mac Daire, stationed at Cathair Conrigh, in
Kerry. The militia of Leinster were the Curaighe Clanna Baoisgne,
to which belonged the renowned Finn Mac Cumhal, his sons, Ossin and
Fergus Filidh, his grandson Oscar, and his relation, Caoilte Mac
Ronan. Cuchullin lived in the first century, in the reign of Conaire
Mac Eidersgeoil, King of Ireland, and Conchobar Mac Nessa, a king of
Ulster; and at the same period lived Curigh Mac Daire, who was slain by
him. Finn Mac Cumhal lived in the reign of Cormac Mac Art, who ruled
from A.D. 227 to 266, and whose daughter Graine he married, and Goll
Mac Moirna was his cotemporary. Finn was slain in the year 285, his
grandson Oscar having fallen in the battle of Gahbra, fought in the
following year. Oissin and Caoilte survived to the time of St. Patrick,
whose mission to Ireland fell in the year 432, and related to him the
exploits of the Feinne; one conversation between these aged Feinne and
the apostle of Ireland having been preserved, and is termed Agallamh na
seanorach or the Dialogue of the Sages.

Such is the account of the Feinne given by the Irish.

If this is history, _cadit questio_. The ancient Irish militia, like
their more modern representatives, could not, it is presumed, be called
upon to leave their country, except in case of invasion; and poems
narrating their adventures and exploits must have been as Irish as the
heroes which were the subject of them.

But we cannot accept it as history in any sense of the term. It is
as illusory and uncertain as are the dates of St. Patrick, and the
narrative of which the one forms a part, is as little to be regarded as
a veracious chronicle, as the life of the other can be accepted as a
genuine biography. The chronology of the one is as questionable as the
era of the other.

Prior to the year 483, the Irish have, strictly speaking, no
chronological history. The battle of Ocha, fought in that year, which
established the dynasty of the Hy‚ÄôNeills on the Irish throne, and the
order of things which existed subsequent to that date, is the great
chronological era which separates the true from the empirical, the
genuine annals of the country from an artificially constructed history.

Prior to that date, we find the reigns of a long succession of monarchs
recorded, with a strange mixture of minute detail, chronological
exactness, and the wildest fable, a wonderful structure of history
palpably artificial, and ranging over a period of upwards of 3000
years. Passing over the arrival of Casar, Noah‚Äôs niece, who landed in
Ireland forty days before the deluge, on the fifteenth day of the moon,
the so-called Irish history records the arrival of four colonies before
that of the Milesians. First, that of Partolan and his followers, who
landed at Inversceine, in the west of Munster, on the 14th day of May,
in the year of the world 2320 or 2680 years B.C., and who all perished
by a pestilence in one week to the number of 9000 on the Hill of Howth,
thirty years after their arrival. Secondly, the Nemedians, under their
leader Nemedius, thirty years after, who, after remaining 217 years
in the island, left it, in consequence of the tyranny and oppression
of the pirates, termed the Fomorians, in three bands,--one going to
Thrace, from whom descended the Firbolg; the second to the North of
Europe or Lochlan, from whom descended the Tuatha De Danann; and the
third to Alban or Scotland, from whom descended the Britons. The third
colony were the Firbolg, who returned to Ireland 217 years after the
arrival of the Nemedians, and consisted of three tribes, the Firbolg,
the Firdomnan, and the Firgailian under five leaders, by whom Ireland
was divided into five provinces. With Slainge, the eldest of the five
brothers, the Irish historians commence the monarchy of Ireland and the
list of her kings. The fourth colony were the Tuatha De Danann, who
went from Lochlan to Alban or Scotland, and from thence to Ireland,
where they landed on Monday the 1st of May, and drove out the Firbolgs,
after they had been thirty-six years in Ireland, to be in their turn
driven out by the Scots, under the three sons of Milesius, Eremon,
Eber, and Ir, who, with their uncle‚Äôs son Lughadh, the son of Ith, led
the fifth and last colony from Spain to Ireland. The island was divided
between the two brothers Eremon and Eber, the former having the north,
and the latter the south half of Ireland; Ir obtaining Ulster under
Eremon, and Lughadh a settlement in Munster under Eber.

From the sons of Milesius to the reign of Lughadh, who was placed on
the throne by the battle of Ocha, there proceeded a line of monarchs
amounting to 116 in number, and extending over a period of upwards of
twenty-one centuries, the descendants of the different sons of Milesius
alternating with each other from time to time, and the reign of each
given with an exactness of date and minuteness of event which betrays
its artificial character. As part of this narrative is introduced the
existence of these bands of Fenian militia, with the dates at which
their leaders are said to have lived.

Is it possible, however, to accept this extraordinary bead-roll of
shadowy monarchs during Pagan times, with their exact chronology,
and the strange and almost ludicrous peculiarities by which each are
distinguished, as serious history, or even to attempt to discriminate
between what may be true and what is false? Are there any materials, or
any data upon which we can even fix upon a date, within a reasonable
compass of time, and say all before that is fable, all after may be
history, till we arrive on firm ground, after the introduction of
Christianity? Professor O‚ÄôCurry is right when he says, in his admirable
lectures on the MS. materials of ancient Irish history, that he cannot
discover any ground on which the annalist Tighernac was able to say,
‚Äúomnia monumenta Scotorum usque Cimbaoth (a king of Ulster, who
flourished in the seventh century, B.C.) incerta erant.‚Äù

From Slainge, the first king of the Firbolgs, who began to reign 1934
years B.C., and ruled only one year, or even from Eremon, the first
monarch of all Ireland of the Milesian race, who began to reign 1700
years B.C., down to Dathy, who was killed by a flash of lightning at
the foot of the Alps in the year 428, and Laogare, his successor, who
was slain by the elements for refusing obedience to St. Patrick‚Äôs
mission which is said to have taken place during his reign, every
reign is stamped with the same character; and what to accept and what
to reject is a problem, for the solution of which the history itself
affords no materials.

If this narrative is to be submitted to historic criticism, is the
later portion less an object of such criticism than the earlier? There
seems no reason why we should accept the history of Neill of the nine
hostages, who reigned from 379 to 405, and had subjected all Britain
and part of France to his sway, and reject that of Ugony More, who
reigned 1000 years earlier, and whose conquests were equally extensive
and equally unknown to European history, or why Ugony‚Äôs twenty-five
sons are less worthy of credit than the thirty sons of Cathoirmor, who
reigned 750 years later. Why the division of Ireland into the two great
portions of north and south, between Conn of the hundred battles and
Modha Nuadhat, in the second century, is to be accepted in preference
to the original division into the same districts between Eremon and
Eber, the sons of Milesius; or which of the divisions of Ireland into
five provinces, that by Tuathal the acceptable, or Eochaddh, called
Feidhlioch, from the deep sighs which he constantly heaved from his
heart, or that by Slainge, the first king of the Firbolgs, is to be
held to represent the event which produced it.

Are the conquests in Scotland by Crimthan mor, and Dathy in the fourth
and fifth centuries, to be accepted, and these equally detailed battles
of Aongus olmucadha and Rechtgidh righ-derg, some centuries earlier, to
be rejected because they occupy a different place in this succession
of unreal monarchs? Are we to accept the reign of Conchobar Mac Nessa
in the first century--to whom the death of Christ upon the cross was
revealed by a Druid at the time it happened, and who became Christian
in consequence, and died from over-exertion in attacking a forest of
trees with his sword which he mistook for the Jews; and the reign of
Cormac Mac Art, called Ulfada, either from the length of his beard
and hair, or because he drove the Uladh or Ultonians far from their
country, where, however, they are ever after found notwithstanding; who
was also miraculously converted to Christianity two centuries before
the supposed arrival of St. Patrick, the apostle of Ireland, and died
by choking upon the bone of an enchanted fish, or, according to other
accounts, was strangled by a number of infernal fiends,--as history,
in preference to the reigns of scores of older monarchs, the events of
whose reigns cannot be said to be less probable.

Must we hold that the chronology of Cuchullin and Corroi, of Finn Mac
Cumhal and Goll Mac Morn, is fixed, because the two former are placed
in the reign of Conchobar Mac Nessa, and the two latter in that of
Cormac Ulfada, or that their Irish character is demonstrated because
they are woven into this Milesian fable?[33]

[33] The following passage is quoted by Petrie (_Round Towers_, p. 96)
from an ancient tract termed the Senchas na Relec, preserved in the
leabhar na h‚Äôuidhre, a MS. of the year 1100:--

‚ÄúCormac Mac Art was the third person who had believed in Erin before
the arrival of St. Patrick; Conchobar Mac Nessa, to whom ≈ítno had
told concerning the crucifixion of Christ, was the first; Moran, the
son of Cairpre Cinncait, was the second; and Cormac was the third.‚Äù

Cairpre Cinncait was the leader of the Attachtuatha in the insurrection
above referred to; and it is remarkable that the reign of Conchobar,
in which Cuchullin and Curoi are said to have flourished, the era of
the occupation of the country by the Attachtuatha, the descendants of
the ante-Milesian population, and the reign of Cormac Mac Art, in which
Finn Mac Cumhal and Goll Mac Morn are said to have lived and fought,
should be connected by the link of a conversion to Christianity. It
seems to synchronize these three periods in tradition with each other,
and with the first introduction of Christianity into Ireland.

The same tract states, that the mythic King Cormac Mac Art ‚Äúwas slain
by Siabhras, _id est_, the Tuatha De Danann, for they were called
Siabhras.‚Äù

In fact, the whole of this history presents a structure so artificial,
so compact, and so alike in all its features, that it is impossible
for any one, like Samson, to withdraw any two pillars without bringing
the whole edifice about his ears, and crushing the entire bead-roll of
unbaptized monarchs beneath its ruins.

The truth is, that notwithstanding the claims of the Irish to an
early cultivation and to a knowledge of letters in Pagan times, the
art of writing was unknown in Ireland till after the introduction of
Christianity, and written history there was none. The only materials
that existed for it were poems, legends, historic tales, and pedigrees,
handed down by tradition; and from these, at a subsequent period, when,
as in all countries, the leisure hours of monks and ecclesiastics
were employed in constructing a history of ante-Christian times, in
imitation of more classical histories, a highly artificial system
was by degrees constructed, embodying the substance of traditions
and myths, real facts and imaginative poems, with bardic and monkish
creations, and the whole based upon the classical model, by which the
different ethnological elements which entered into the population of
the country were cloaked under an artificial and symbolical genealogy.

But it is not chronological history. The dates are quite artificial,
and the whole creation melts and resolves itself into its original
elements upon investigation. The pre-Milesian colonies are found
existing and occupying large tracts of the country down to a late
period of the ante-Christian history. The provincial kings, when
closely examined, lose their Milesian name, and are found ruling
over Firbolgs, Firdomnan and Cruithne; and notwithstanding that the
Milesians had been for 1600 years in possession of the country, and a
flourishing monarchy is supposed to have existed for so long a period,
we find, as late as the second century after Christ, the Attachtuatha,
as the descendants of the Firbolg, Firdomnan, and Tuatha De Danann
were termed during the Milesian monarchy, in full possession of the
country for nearly a century, and in close alliance with the Cruithne
of Ulster; during which time the Milesian kings were in exile, and
the process of subjugating these tribes, supposed to be completed
1600 years before by Eremon and Eber, is again repeated by Tuathal
teachtmhar, who arrives with an army from Alban.

The descendants of the different sons of Milesius likewise assume
foreign characteristics. The race of Ir, son of Milesius, who possessed
the whole of Ulster till the Heremonian settlements almost within
the domain of history, are found calling themselves on all occasions
Cruithne. The descendants of Ith called themselves Clanna Breogan,
and occupy the territory where Ptolemy, in the second century, places
an offshoot of British Brigantes. Eremon and Eber seem to represent
the northern and southern Scots distinguished by Bede, a distinction
reproduced in Conn of the hundred battles, and Modha Nuadha.

The legend of St. Patrick, too, in its present shape, is not older than
the ninth century; and, under the influence of an investigation into
older authorities, he dissolves into three personages; Sen-Patricius,
whose day in the calendar is the 24th August; Palladius _qui est
Patricius_, to whom the mission in 432 properly belongs, and who
is said to have retired to Alban or Scotland, where he died among
the Cruithne; and Patricius, whose day is the 17th of March, and
to whom alone a certain date can be assigned,--for he died, in the
chronological period, in the year 493,--and from the acts of these
three saints the subsequent legend of the great apostle of Ireland was
compiled, and an arbitrary chronology applied to it.

The Feine also, when looked at a little more closely, emerge from under
the guise of a Milesian militia, and assume the features of a distinct
race. Cuchullin, Conall cearnach, and the children of Uisneach belong
to the race of Ir, and are Cruithne. Goll Mac Morn and his Clanna
Moirne are Firbolg; Curigh Mac Daire and his Clanna Deaghadh are Ernai;
and though they are called Heremonians in Irish history, yet they
are also said to be a Firbolg tribe of the same race with the Clanna
Morna; and in the poem of Maolmura, who died in 884, they are said to
be of the race of Ith, and, therefore, probably Britons,--a conjecture
singularly corroborated by the fact that there exists, in Welsh, a poem
on the death of Curigh Mac Daire; and, finally, Finn Mac Cumhal and
his Clanna Baiosgne, although a Heremonian pedigree is given to them,
it is not the only one known to the old Irish MSS. There is a second,
deducing him from the Clanna Deaghaidh, the same race with that of
Curigh Mac Daire; and a third, and probably the oldest, states that he
was of the Ui Tairsigh, and that they were of the Attachtuatha, as the
descendants of the non-Milesian tribes were called, a fact corroborated
by Maolmura, who says--

    Six tribes not of Breoghan‚Äôs people
    Who hold lands,
    The Gabhraighe Succa, _Ui Tairsigh_,
    Galeons of Leinster.

The fact is, when the fictitious catalogue of Milesian kings was
extended over so many centuries, and the Milesian monarchy drawn
back to so remote a period, it became necessary to account for the
appearance of non-Milesian races in the old traditional stories, and
they were either clothed with a Milesian name and pedigree, or some
device hit upon to account for their separate existence; and thus the
Feinne, a pre-Milesian warrior race they could not account for, appear
under the somewhat clumsy guise of a standing body of Milesian militia,
having peculiar privileges and strange customs.

The Irish Ossianic poems, as well as those in the Dean‚Äôs MS., indicate
that the Feinne were not a body of troops confined to Ireland, but
belonged, whoever they were, to a much wider extent of territory.

Thus, the poem on the battle of Gabhra, published in the first volume
of the Transactions of the Ossianic Society--a battle in which Oscar
the son of Ossian was slain, and the Feinne from all quarters took
part--we find the following verses:

    The bands of the Fians of Alban,
    And the supreme King of Breatan,
    Belonging to the order of the Feinne of Alban,
    Joined us in that battle.

    The Fians of Lochlin were powerful.
    From the chief to the leader of nine men,
    They mustered along with us
    To share in the struggle.

Again--

    Boinne, the son of Breacal, exclaimed,
    With quickness, fierceness, and valour,--
    I and the Fians of Breatan,
    Will be with Oscar of Eamhain.

There were thus in this battle, besides Feinne of Erin, Feinne of
Alban, Breatan, and Lochlan.

Alba or Alban was Scotland, north of the Firths of Forth and Clyde.

Breatan was not Wales, but the southern districts of Scotland, of which
Dunbreatan, now Dumbarton, was the chief seat.

Lochlan was the north of Germany, extending from the Rhine to the
Elbe;[34] and the name of Lochlanach was originally applied to the
ancient traditionary pirates termed the Fomorians. When the Norwegian
and Danish pirates appeared in the ninth century, they were likewise
called Lochlanach; and the name of Lochlan was transferred to Norway
and Denmark, from whence they came. There is every reason to believe
that the Low German race were preceded, in the more ancient Lochlan, by
a Celtic people.

[34] A passage in one of the oldest of the MSS., deposited in the
Library of the Faculty of Advocates, shows that the term Lochlan was
anciently applied to the districts east of the Rhine. ‚ÄúC√¶sar came with
some entire legions of the ruthless youth of Italy into the rough land
of Gallia, and the wide and long country of Lochlain. For these are one
and the same country; _but for the interposition of the clear current
of the Rhine, which divides and sunders the two lands_.‚Äù

The Feinne then belonged to the pre-Milesian races, and were connected,
not only with Erin, but likewise with Alban, Breatan, and Lochlan.
Now, there are just two people mentioned in the Irish records who had
settlements in Ireland, and who yet were connected with Alban, Breatan,
and Lochlan. These were the people termed the Tuatha De Danann, and the
Cruithne.

The traditionary migration of the Tuatha De Danann brings them from
Lochlan, where they possessed four cities, to Alban, where they
inhabited a district termed Dobhar and Jr Dobhar; and from thence they
went to Erin, where they drove out the Firbolg, to be subdued in their
turn by the Milesian Scots.

The Cruithne are likewise brought from Lochlan to Erin and from Erin to
Alban, where they founded a kingdom, which included, till the seventh
century, the Cruithne of Ulster, and which was subverted in the ninth
century by the Milesian Scots.

These two tribes were thus the prior race in each country. Both must
have been prior to the Low German population of Lochlan. The Cruithne
were the race prior to the Scots in Alban, and the Tuatha De Dannan
the prior colony to the Milesian Scots in Erin. The Feinne are brought
by all the old historic tales into close contact with the Tuatha De
Danann; a portion of them were avowedly Cruithne; and if they were,
as we have seen, in Erin, not of the Milesian race, but of the prior
population, and likewise connected with Alban, Breatan, and Lochlan,
the inference is obvious, that, whether a denomination for an entire
people or for a body of warriors, they belonged to the previous
population which preceded the Germans in Lochlan and the Scots in Erin
and Alban.

This view is corroborated by the fact, that in the old poems and tales
the Feinne appear, as we have said, in close connexion with the Tuatha
De Danann. They are likewise connected with the Cruithne, as in the
Lamentation of Cuchullin over the body of his son Conlaoch, in Miss
Brooke‚Äôs collection, where he says--

    Alas! that it was not in the land of the Cruithne
    Of the Feinne bloody and fierce,
    That thou didst fall, active youth,
    Or in the gloomy land of Sorcha.

While the traditions of the Cruithne, in narrating their migration and
the names of their leaders, mention, as the mythic poet of their race,
a name singularly like that of Ossian--

    Cathmolodar the hardknobbed,
    And Cathmachan the bright,
    Were glorious youths;
    The two valiant sons of Cathluan,

    His hardy puissant champions;
    Heavy, stern was their trampling,
    Cing victorious in his victory.
    Im, son of Pernn, were their names;
    _Huasein_ was the name of his poet,
    Who sought out the path of pleasantry.

In answering, then, the preliminary questions of who were the Feinne?
and to what period do they belong? we may fairly infer that they were
of the population who immediately preceded the Scots in Erin and in
Alban, and that they belong to that period in the history of both
countries, before a political separation had taken place between them,
when they were viewed as parts of one territory, though physically
separated, and when a free and unrestrained intercourse took place
between them; when race and not territory was the great bond of
association, and the movements of their respective populations from one
country to the other were not restrained by any feeling of national
separation.

It was natural that the deeds and events connected with this warrior
race, associated as they must have been with the physical features of
the country in which they dwelt, should have formed the subject of
the early poems and legendary tales of their successors, and that a
body of popular poetry should have sprung up in each country, which
occupied itself with adventures, expeditions, and feats of bravery of
this previous race, which were common to both countries, and which,
attributed to their mythic poets, and full of the names of heroes, and
of the scenes of their exploits, would be appropriated by the bards of
each country to their own districts. The names of the places connected
in tradition with these events would, as they were localized in the
respective countries, be identified with its scenery and physical
features, and thus a species of Fenian topography would spring up
in each country, which, having a common origin, would bear the same
character, and possess a mutual resemblance. Each country would thus
claim the Feinne as their exclusive property, and could point to a
body of popular Ossianic poetry in support of their claim, and to the
Fenian names of their localities, in proof of the events which form the
subject of the poems having there occurred.

The allusions to Fingal in the older Scottish historians who wrote long
before Macpherson‚Äôs Ossian appeared, or the controversy arose, show
that stories of the Feinne were current in Scotland, and that they were
regarded as belonging to this country as much as to Ireland, while the
Fenian names of localities in charters and other documents evince that
a Fenian topography likewise existed in Scotland before that period.[35]

[35] It is unnecessary here to repeat these references. They will be
found in the Report of the Highland Society, page 21.

The quotation from Barbour shows that the name of Fingal was known
long before the time of Macpherson; and as most Gaelic proper names
had a corresponding name in English which resembled it in sound, and
was held to represent it, as Hector for Eachin, or Hugh for Aodh, it
is not unlikely that Fingal may have been known as the recognised
representative in English of Finn.

In fact, Finn and Fingal are both real names, and closely related to
each other.

_Gal_ is a syllable of unknown origin and meaning, which enters largely
into the composition of Gaelic proper names. Thus we have Aedgal,
Aelgal, Angal, Ardgal, Artgal, Bodgal, Comgal, Congal, Donngal,
Dubhgal, Dungal, Feargal, Fingal, Gormgal, Leargal, Maengal, Riagal,
Saergal, Smiorgal. Some also take the form of _galach_; as Congalach,
Dungalach, Fiangalach, Irgalach.

Those in which the first syllable expresses a colour appear both alone
and with the affix _gal_, as Dubh and Dubhgal, Finn and Finngal, and
are really the same name. The annals of the Four Masters mention
several persons of the name of Finn, and, in 741, Finghal of Lismore.

Kirke, in his Psalter, published in 1684, adds the following address:--

      Imthigh a Dhuilleachan gu dan,
      Le dan glan diagha duisgiad thall;
    Cuir failte arfonn fial nab fionn,
    Ar-gharbh chriocha is Inseadh Gall.

That is,--

    Little volume go boldly forth,
    Rouse whom you reach to pure and godly strains;
    Hail the generous land of the Feinne,
    The Roughbounds and the Western Isles.

The Roughbounds were the districts from Morvaren to Glenelg, which,
with the Isles, are thus called the land of the Feinne.

The districts in which the Fenian names enter most largely into the
topography of the Highlands are Atholl, Lochaber, Lorn, and Morvaren,
Glenelg, and the districts about Loch Ness; and the antiquity of this
topography in the Highlands of Scotland is proved by an old gloss to a
charter by Alexander the Second to the monks of Kinloss of the lands of
Burgyn, within the ancient Celtic province of Moray, which is preserved
in the Chartulary of the Bishopric. The boundary of the lands passes
by a place called Tuber na Fein, meaning literally the well of the
Feinne, and the gloss is ‚Äúor _feyne_, of the grett or kempis men callit
_ffenis_, is ane well.‚Äù

Cuchullin was of the race of the Cruithne, and belongs both to Ulster
and to Scotland. In Ulster his seat was Dundealgan, and the scene of
his exploits the district of Cuailgne and the mountains of Sleave
Cuillin; but even Irish tradition admits that he was reared by
Sgathaig, in the Isle of Skye, and here we have Dunsgathaig and the
Cuillin Hills.

The children of Uisneach were likewise Cruithne, and must have preceded
the Scots, for the great scene of their Scotch adventures are the
districts of Lorn, Loch Aw, and Cowall, afterwards the possessions of
the Dalriadic Scots; thus, in the vicinity of Oban, we have Dun mhic
Uisneachan, now corruptly called in guide-books Dun mac Sniachan, a
fort with vitrified remains; and here we have on Loch Etive, Glen
Uisneach, and Suidhe Deardhuil. The names of the three sons of Uisneach
were Ainle, Ardan, and Naoise; and it is remarkable that Adomnan, in
his life of St. Columba, written in the seventh century, appears to
mention only three localities in connexion with St. Columba‚Äôs journey
to the palace of the king of the Picts, near Loch Ness, and these are
Cainle, Arcardan, and the flumen Nesae. Two vitrified forts in the
neighbourhood of Lochness are called Dundeardhuil.[36]

[36] It is remarkable that the ancient legends of Cuchullin and the
sons of Uisneach connect them with those remarkable structures termed
vitrified forts. Dun Scathaig, Dun mhic Uisneachan, and Dundheardhuil,
are all vitrified forts, and the latter is a common name for them.
There is probably a mythic meaning under this.

The hunt of Diarmed O‚ÄôDuine after the boar on Bengulbain, and his
death by measuring his length against the bristles, enters into Scotch
topography in three different localities; in Glenshee, where there
is a hill called Bengulbain, also in Glenroy, where we have also a
Bengulbain and an Eassroy, and also on the south bank of Loch Ness.
Daire donn, who appears in the Cath Finntragha identified by the Irish
with Ventry, has also deposited his name on a mountain in Ardgour,
close to the west sea, called Meall Dayre donn.

The mountain streams and lakes in these districts of the Highlands are
everywhere redolent of names connected with the heroes and actions of
the Feinne, and show that a body of popular legends connected with
them, whether in poetry or in prose, preserved by oral recitation
or committed to writing, must have existed in the country when this
topography sprung up, though it does not follow that the events, though
now associated with the scenery of the country, originally happened
there any more than does the Fenian topography of Ireland.

These legendary poems and tales seem to have passed through three
different stages.

In the first and oldest form they were pure poems, of more or less
excellence, narrating the adventures and deeds of these warrior bands,
whose memory still lingered in the country; each poem being complete in
itself, and constructed upon a metrical system which brought the aid
of alliteration and of rhyme, or correspondence of sounds, to assist
the memory in retaining what had been received by oral recitation,
and to render it less easy to forget or lose a part. These poems seem
generally to have been attributed to one mythic poet of the race they
celebrate.

Then, as the language in which these poems were composed became altered
or modified, or as the reciters were less able to retain the whole,
they would narrate, in ordinary prose, the events of the part of the
poem they had forgotten, and merely recite the poetry of what they
recollected; and thus they would pass into the second stage of prose
tales, interspersed with fragments of poetry.

Bards who were themselves composers as well as reciters, besides
composing poems on the subjects of the day in which they lived,
would likewise select the Fenian legends as their themes, and become
imitators of the older Ossianic poetry. The prose narrative would form
the basis of their poem; and thus would arise the third stage of their
poems, in which they were reconstructed from the prose tales, and again
appear as long poems, the names and incidents being the same as in the
older poems, and the fragments of them preserved in the prose tale,
imbedded in the new poem.

The poems of the first stage were probably common to Ireland and to
Scotland, and traces of them are to be found wherever the Feinne
were supposed to have once existed; though, in countries where their
successors were of a different race, and spoke a different language,
the continuity of the tradition would be at once broken.

Among the ancient poems in the Welsh language which have been
preserved, there exists an Ossianic poem called Marwnad Coire map
Daire, or the death-song of Curoi, son of Daire, the traditionary head,
according to Irish history, of the Fenian militia of Munster, but who,
as we have seen, appears to belong to the body called the Feinne of
Breatan; and the poem, no doubt, belongs to the northern Cumbrian
kingdom, which had Dunbreatan for its chief seat. Curoi is called Chief
of the Southern Sea, and the contest between him and Cuchullin is
mentioned.[37]

[37] This poem, with a translation, is given in the Additional Notes,
pp. 143, 144.

Poems of the same character seem also to have been known in the Isle
of Man, as O‚ÄôConnor, in his catalogue of the Stow ms., mentions a MS.
containing ‚ÄúFinn and Ossian,--a Manx coronach, with Manx on one side of
the page, and Irish on the other.‚Äù

The oldest which has been found in any MSS. preserved in the Highlands
is a poem of five quatrains, at the end of a glossary contained in a
MS. written prior to the year 1500. It is in old Gaelic, and there is
an interlineal gloss, explaining the meaning of the expressions in more
familiar language. At the end there is a line stating that Ossian was
the author of the poem.

It may be not uninteresting to insert here the text of the poem, with
its glosses:--

TRANSLATION.

    My eyes slumbered in sleep,
    My spear was with my shield,
    My sword was in my hand,
    And my hand under my ear.
    A strange dream happened to me,
    I set swiftly my dogs
    On a sow in the plain upon flesh.
    She was fat to the tusk in her jaw,
    Thirty feet for me with my shoes
    In her side to the beard of her snout.
    Thirty inches for Finn in her tusk
    Fat above on her under her hide.
    Large as a caldron was each eye,
    Large as a vessel the hollow beneath.
    My sword hewed in her neck,
    And my dogs fixed on her ear.
    Sow of the sea of eastern Tallann,
    Which strikes the rock where the wave touches.
    My limbs were to me a protection to me strong,
    As thyself not weak like thee.

Ossian sung this at the shore of the sea of Tallann, for the champion
of the sow.[38]

[38] The scene of this poem is in Scotland, the sea of Tallann being
said to be in the east, and it must have been written in Scotland, as
the accent is placed on the first syllable of the name Oisin.

The Highlanders call a whale _muic mhara_, and, from the description,
this creature appears to have been a whale.

On communicating this curious poem to Professor O‚ÄôCurry, he informs
me that there is a copy of it in the Book of Leinster, an MS. of the
thirteenth century. The text is the same, but the glosses a little
different.

I may take this opportunity of calling attention to Professor O‚ÄôCurry‚Äôs
admirable Lectures on the MS. literature of Ireland, just published.
They are most interesting and instructive, and for the masterly and
complete survey taken of the subject, as well as for accurate and
minute detail, they are almost unexampled in the annals of literature.
They will well repay perusal.

The tales of Cuchullin and Conlaoch, and the tale of the Sons of
Uisneach, are good specimens of the second class. The latter is one
of three tales, called the Three Woes, the two others relating to
families of the Tuatha De Danann; but though these tales may be Irish,
and of this period, they contain fragments of poems probably much
older, and which may have been derived from another source. One of the
poems in the tale of the Children of Uisneach contains such a tender
recollection of and touching allusion to Highland scenery, that it is
hardly possible to suppose that it was not originally composed by a
genuine son of Alban.

It is the lament of Deirdre or Darthula over Alban, and the following
is a translation:--

    Beloved land that Eastern land,
    Alba, with its wonders.
    O that I might not depart from it,
    But that I go with Naise.

    Beloved is Dunfidhgha and Dun Finn;
    Beloved the Dun above them;
    Beloved is Innisdraighende,
    And beloved Dun Suibhne.

    Coillchuan! O Coillchuan!
    Where Ainnle would, alas! resort;
    Too short, I deem, was then my stay
    With Ainnle in Oirir Alban.

    Glenlaidhe! O Glenlaidhe!
    I used to sleep by its soothing murmur;
    Fish, and flesh of wild boar and badger
    Was my repast in Glenlaidhe.

    Glenmasan! O Glenmasan;
    High its herbs, fair its boughs.
    Solitary was the place of our repose
    On grassy Invermasan.

    Gleneitche! O Gleneitche!
    There was raised my earliest home.
    Beautiful its woods on rising,
    When the sun struck on Gleneitche.

    Glen Urchain! O Glen Urchain!
    It was the straight glen of smooth ridges.
    Not more joyful was a man of his age
    Than Naoise in Glen Urchain.

    Glendaruadh! O Glendaruadh!
    My love each man of its inheritance.
    Sweet the voice of the cuckoo on bending bough,
    On the hill above Glendaruadh.

    Beloved is Draighen and its sounding shore;
    Beloved the water o‚Äôer pure sand.
    O that I might not depart from the east,
    But that I go with my beloved![39]

[39] The oldest copy of this tale, which was the foundation of
Macpherson‚Äôs Darthula, is in the Glenmasan MS., in the collection
in the Advocates‚Äô Library, which bears the date of 1238, and this
translation is made from it.

The scenery is all in Argyllshire. Inis Draighen is Inistrynich
in Loch-awe; Dun Suibhne, Castle Sween; Glenlaidhe is now called
Glenlochy, where is Benlaoidhe; Glenmasan still bears the name;
Gleneitche, in another copy called Loch Eitche, is Glenetive and
Loch Etive; Glenurchain is Glenurchay; and Glendaruadh is now called
Glendaruail.

The third class of Ossianic poems belongs principally to that period
when, during the sway of the Lords of the Isles, Irish influence was
so much felt on the language and literature of the Highlands, and when
the Highland bards and sennachies were trained in bardic schools,
presided over by Irish bards of eminence. It was at this period mainly
that the Irish poems assumed so much the shape of a dialogue between
the Ossianic poets and St. Patrick, the apostle of Ireland; and the
Highland bards imitated this form, often adding or prefixing a few
sentences of such dialogue to older poems, or composing poems in
imitation of Ossian in this form; but the imitation, in this respect,
of Irish poems by native bards is apparent from this, that Patrick is
in the Irish poems correctly called Mac Calphurn or M‚ÄôAlphurn, his
father, according to his own ‚ÄúConfessio,‚Äù having been Calphurnius, but
the Highland bards, to whom Patrick‚Äôs history was strange, and this
epithet unintelligible, have substituted the peculiarly Scotch form of
Alpine, and styled him Patrick Mac Alpine.

One of the poems in Macpherson‚Äôs fragments has been one of these--the
sixth fragment,--which begins and ends with a dialogue between Ossian
and the son of Alpin.

It was at the same period that the collection of Gaelic poems was
made by the Dean of Lismore, and it includes many poems in which this
dialogue occurs, but in most the saint is termed Macalpine, showing its
non-Irish source.

The Ossianic poems in this collection attributed to Ossian, Fergus
Filidh, and Caoilte, the three Fenian bards, and those which are either
anonymous or composed by imitators, as Gillecalum Mac an Olla and Allan
Mac Ruadhri, with the other poems which are not Ossianic, afford a fair
specimen of the poetic literature current in the Highlands of Scotland
at the close of this period, and before the fall of the Lords of the
Isles, and the Reformation again severed that country from Ireland,
and ushered in a period of reaction and return towards the native
dialect and literature.

On the whole, then, we fully admit the claims of Ireland to Fenian
legends and tales, and their attendant poems, but not to an exclusive
possession of them.

We admit that its Fenian topography is authentic, but it is not the
only one.

We admit its claim to an early written and cultivated speech, but not
to the only dialect of Gaelic in which such poems once existed.

We hold that Scotland possesses likewise Fenian legends and Ossianic
poetry derived from an independent source, and a Fenian topography
equally genuine; and we consider her dialect of the common Gaelic
tongue not undeserving of the attention of philologers.

[Illustration: I. AUTOGRAPH OF DEAN M‚ÄôGREGOR]

[Illustration: II. PART OF OSSIAN‚ÄôS ODE TO FINN P. 26.,18-19.]




THE BOOK OF THE DEAN OF LISMORE.


The author of this is Ossian,[40] the son of Finn:[41]


    I‚Äôve seen the household of Finn.
    No men were they of coward race.
    I saw by my side a vision
    Of the hero‚Äôs household yesterday.
    I‚Äôve seen the household[42] of Art,[43]
    He with the brown-haired son of gentle speech;
    No better man I ever saw.
    I‚Äôve seen the household of Finn.
    Who ever saw what I have seen?
    I‚Äôve seen Finn armed with Luno‚Äôs son.[44]
    How sad the mournful memory.
    I‚Äôve seen the household of Finn.
    Never can I recount the ills
    Which now do crown my head.
    Do thou free us for ever from pain.
    I‚Äôve seen the household of Finn.
                             I‚Äôve seen, etc.

[40] The name of this poet has given rise to some controversy between
the Scotch and Irish Gael. By the latter it is pronounced _Ois√¨n_, the
accent falling on the last syllable; by the former it is pronounced
_Ossian_, the accent falling on the first. Dean M‚ÄôGregor spells the
word sometimes _Ossan_, but usually _Ossin_. It is manifest from the
use of the _ss_ that he intends the accent to fall upon the first
syllable, according to the Scottish mode. The Scottish pronunciation
would appear to have been the same in his days as now. This form of the
word we have retained in our translation. We do not mean to institute
any comparison between the Irish and Scottish mode. The difference
clearly arises from the peculiarity of each dialect, the Irish almost
uniformly, in words of two syllables, laying the accent on the last,
and the Scottish upon the first syllable.

[41] The Dean‚Äôs Finn is the Fingal of some writers. ‚ÄúFionn,‚Äù pronounced
‚ÄúFi≈≠ghn,‚Äù genitive, ‚ÄúFhinn,‚Äù pronounced ‚ÄúIghn,‚Äù is the present Scottish
and Irish form of the word, and we have preserved this in M‚ÄôGregor‚Äôs
own orthography. Scottish writers have, however, been unjustly accused
of manufacturing the term ‚ÄúFingal.‚Äù It is not, as some Irish scholars
have maintained, a modern corruption of Fin mac C√πil, but a word known
and in use for centuries. John Barbour, who wrote his metrical life of
King Robert Bruce in 1375, uses it as a familiar term:--

    ‚ÄúHe said, Methinks Martheoke‚Äôs son
    Right as Gow-mac-Morn was won,
    To have from Fingal his menzie.‚Äù

It would appear, from the analogies of the Gaelic language, to be the
complete form of the word. ‚ÄúFionn‚Äù means _fair_, being in reality an
adjective noun; ‚ÄúGal‚Äù is a common termination of Celtic proper names.
Hence, ‚ÄúFionn Ghal,‚Äù or ‚ÄúFingal,‚Äù means the ‚Äúfair-haired one.‚Äú In like
manner, we have ‚ÄúDubh,‚Äú _black_, ‚ÄúGhal,‚Äù ‚ÄúDubhghal,‚Äù or ‚ÄúDugald;‚Äù
‚ÄúDonn,‚Äù brown, ‚ÄúGhal,‚Äù ‚ÄúDonnghal,‚Äù _Dungal_, _Donald_, the brown-haired
one. Hence, Fionn is a contraction of the name. It is remarkable as
an instance of the changes which take place in the use of words, that
in modern times ‚ÄúFionnghal‚Äù is the name of a woman, and is usually
translated ‚ÄúFlora.‚Äú

[42] In the original the word translated here, ‚Äúhousehold,‚Äú is
‚Äútylych,‚Äú or ‚Äúteaghlach,‚Äú a _family_. The literal translation would
be, ‚Äúthe family of Art.‚Äù But this would not convey the idea in the
original, the Celtic _family_ in such a case as this implying the
military followers of the head or chief. It seems probable that these
ancient Celtic chiefs, like chiefs in more recent times, had their
armed followers in constant attendance on them.

[43] Art was King of Ireland, according to Irish authorities, in the
beginning of the third century. Tradition says that he was the father
of Grainne, the wife of Finn, whose defection and escape with Diarmad
led to the event so famous in ancient Celtic poetry, the death of
Diarmad. A poem relating the event will be found in this collection.

[44] ‚ÄúMac an Loinn,‚Äù or ‚ÄúLuno‚Äôs son,‚Äú was the famous sword of Fingal,
manufactured by Loinn mac Liobhaidh, the celebrated smith, or ‚ÄúVulcan,‚Äú
of the Celts. The sword was so effective that in no case was it ever
required to give a second stroke. The Gaelic words are, ‚ÄúCha d‚Äô fh√†g
e fuigheall beuma,‚Äù--It left no remnant for its stroke. We have heard
of a remarkable instance of the effective use of this phrase in the
pulpit by a distinguished Highland minister, Mr. Lachlan M‚ÄôKenzie of
Lochcarron. In illustrating the completeness of the one sacrifice of
our Lord, he said, and to a Highland audience it was electrifying,
‚ÄúChuala sibh mu ‚Äôn chlaidheamh bh‚Äô aig Fionn, nach d‚Äô fh√†g riamh
fuigheall beuma,‚Äù--_You have heard of Fingal‚Äôs sword, which never
needed to give a second blow._ ‚ÄúLoinn mac Liobhaidh,‚Äù the ‚ÄúVulcan‚Äù of
the Celts, is in reality _Brightness, the son of polishing_, a fact
which would go far to prove the mythical character of this famous
artisan.


The author of this is Ossian:[45]


    Long are the clouds this night above me;
    The last was a long night to me.
    This day, although I find it long,
    Yesterday was longer still.
    Each day that comes is long to me,
    Such indeed was not my wont.
    Now is no fight, or battle-field,
    No learning noble feats of arms
    Without maiden, song, or harp;
    No crushing bones or warlike deeds,
    No studious learning any more,
    No hospitable heart or board,
    No soft wooing, and no chase,
    In both of which I took delight.
    Without the battle-march or fight,
    Alas! how sorrowful life‚Äôs close;
    No hunting of the hind or stag,
    How different from my heart‚Äôs desire!
    No trappings for our hounds, no hounds.
    Long are the clouds this night above me.
    No rising up to noble feats,
    No mirthful sport as we would wish,
    No swimming heroes in our lakes.
    Long are the clouds this night above me;
    In this great world none is like me,
    So sad, how sad my case!
    A poor old man now dragging stones.
    Long are the clouds this night above me,
    The last man of the Feine am I,
    The great Ossian, the son of Finn,
    Listening to the sound of bells.[46]
    Long are the clouds this night above me.

    Find, O Patrick, from thy God
    What our eternal state shall be.
    Freed may we ever be from ill.
    Long are the clouds this night above me.
                            Long are the clouds, etc.

[45] This piece is extracted and printed in the report on the Poems
of Ossian, published by the Highland Society. Dr. Smith, however,
who made the extract, appears not to have read it with much care
or accuracy, and the concluding portion, from the twentieth line
downwards, is suppressed altogether. This seems to have arisen from a
desire to suppress all the references in those poems to St. Patrick,
and thus to establish by all possible means their Scottish origin.
If any of the Poems are the genuine compositions of Ossian, there is
sufficient evidence that the references to the Saint are of more recent
introduction, in the fact, that if Ossian saw Art, who lived in the
opening of the third century, as he tells us in the preceding fragment,
he could hardly hold a dialogue with St. Patrick, who flourished in the
fifth. In the present publication the poems of every kind are given
just as they stand, without any reference to the effect on existing
systems and theories, Scotch or Irish.

[46] The bells used in Christian worship. ‚ÄúPatrick of the bells,‚Äù is a
common appellation of St. Patrick in these compositions.

The Author of this is Ossian:

    Once on a time when Finn my loved
    Went to hunt on the ‚ÄúFair maids‚Äô hill,‚Äù[47]
    With three thousand nobles of the Feine,
    Their shields aloft o‚Äôer their heads.
    Ossian! thy words are sweet to me,
    My blessing on the soul of Finn.[48]
    Tell us the number of the deer
    That fell on the ‚ÄúFair maids‚Äô hill.‚Äù

[47] ‚ÄúSliabh nam ban fionn,‚Äù or the ‚Äúhill of the fair-haired women,‚Äù is
said to be one of the mountains of Tipperary, in the neighbourhood of
Clonmel. It is now called ‚ÄúSliabh nam ban,‚Äù and has several traditions
of the Feine associated with it. The writer is not aware of any
mountain of the name in Scotland; besides, although the word ‚ÄúSliabh‚Äù
is well known and in common use among the Scottish Highlanders, it is
seldom found in the topography of the country, in which the almost
uniform term for a mountain is ‚ÄúBeinn,‚Äù the English ‚ÄúBen.‚Äù This is
one of the marked differences between Irish and Scottish topography.
The term under consideration has sometimes been called in Scotland
‚ÄúSliabh nam beann fionn,‚Äù ‚Äúthe hill of the fair hills,‚Äù a manifest
mistake, which the meaningless tautology should be enough to prove.
Topographical phrases in the Gaelic language are usually not only
grammatically accurate, but of remarkable elegance in their structure.
The interpretations often put upon them are a monstrous outrage upon
this sound and invariable principle.

[48] It is obvious that parts of these compositions are dialogues, for
the most part between Ossian and St. Patrick. The dialogue portion in
these editions of Dean M‚ÄôGregor‚Äôs is generally either prefixed or added
to the body of the poem. This is quite consistent with the genuineness
of the work, and can be explained upon the supposition, that these
portions were either prefixed or adjoined at an after period by some
other hand to serve a purpose. This cannot be said of those poems which
are in the form of dialogues throughout.

    How vigorously we shook our spears,
    For never hast thou sung the deer
    Slain on the ‚ÄúFair maids‚Äô hill,‚Äù
    By the hand of Finn of the feasts.
    Tell them the tale in full,
    My blessing on thy guileless lips.
    Had you your dress and your armour
    When you went forth to the chase?

    We had our dress and our armour
    When we went forth to the chase;
    There was no Fian amongst us all
    Without his fine soft flaxen shirt,
    Without his under coat of substance soft,
    Without a coat of mail of brightest steel,
    The covering for his head adorned with gems,
    And in his hand he bore two spears,
    Besides a fierce and conquering shield,
    And sword that never failed to cleave the skull.
    Wert thou to search the universe
    Thou would‚Äôst not find a braver man than Finn;
    Of noblest race and fairest form,
    No arm from him could carry victory.
    As he went forth to try his snow-white hound
    Who ‚Äômongst us all was like to Finn?
    Westward we went, an ordered band,
    To hunt on the ‚ÄúFair maids‚Äô hill.‚Äù
    O Patrick, pupil of the church‚Äôs head,
    Bright was the sun above us,
    As in the midst of us sat Finn.
    Eastward and westward sweetly rung,
    From hill to hill the voice of hounds,
    Arousing boars and harts.
    Then Finn and Bran[49] did sit alone
    A little while upon the mountain side,
    Each of them panting for the chase,
    Their fierceness and their wrath aroused.
    Then did we unloose three thousand hounds
    Of matchless vigour and unequalled strength.
    Each of the hounds brought down two deer,
    Long ere ‚Äôtwas time to bind them in their thongs.
    That day there fell six thousand deer,
    Down in the vale that lies beneath the hill;
    There never fell so many deer and roe
    In any hunt that e‚Äôer till this took place.
    But sad was the chase down to the east,
    Thou cleric of the church and bells,
    Ten hundred of our hounds, with golden chains,
    Fell wounded by ten hundred boars:
    Then by our hands there fell the boars,
    Which wrought the ill upon the plain.
    And were it not for blades and vigorous arms,
    That chase had been a slaughter.

[49] Bran was the famous hound of Finn. The word means ‚Äúa raven,‚Äù but
used as an adjective it signifies ‚Äúblack,‚Äù which is apparently the
origin of the name. Another of his dogs was called ‚ÄúLuath,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSwift,‚Äù
also an adjective. These are common names for staghounds in the
Highlands at this day. Reference is made a few lines before this to a
white dog, ‚Äúachoin ghil,‚Äù translated ‚Äúsnow-white,‚Äù ‚Äúgeal,‚Äù implying the
most intense whiteness.

    O Patrick of the holy crosier,
    Eastward or westward, hast thou ever seen,
    Another chase, in all thy days,
    Greater than that of Finn and of the Feine?
    This then was the hunt of Finn,
    Thou son of Alpin[50] of the holy relics,
    More than thy howling in the church
    Do I love to tell the day.
                            Once on a time, etc.


The author of this is Ossian:[51]


    Once on a time as Patrick of the holy crook
    Betook him to his cell,
    He sought as his companion
    Ossian of gentle mien.

    Now let me hear, he said,
    Ossian, whose courage has made foes retreat,
    Who of all those whom thou ne‚Äôer sang‚Äôst,
    Most vexed the Feine of Finn?

    Priest of the spotted crook,[52]
    Thy lifetime it would take
    To tell in human speech
    The glory of the Feine of Finn.

[50] The Irish call this word ‚ÄúArpluinn,‚Äù in Latin, ‚ÄúCalphurnius.‚Äù In
the Highlands the name is uniformly ‚ÄúAlpin,‚Äù--‚ÄúPadruig mac Alpain.‚Äù

[51] This composition the Irish call the battle of ‚ÄúVentry Harbour,‚Äù a
place in the county of Kerry in Ireland. There are, however, Fintrays
in Scotland, which are apparently the same name, and Mr. Skene has
called the attention of the writer to the fact, that there is a Sg√πir
Dhaire dhuinn, ‚Äúthe hill of Daire donn,‚Äù in Duror in Argyleshire.
Irish Antiquaries say the battle was fought in the third century
between the F√©ine of Ireland and Daire donn, or Daire the brown, King
of the world. It will be seen in this copy that Daire is introduced
as King of Lochlin or Scandinavia, although afterwards called King of
the world. It is very probable that both to the Scotch and Irish Celt
Scandinavia was at this period synonymous with the world. This poem is
here attributed to Ossian, although it is very doubtful whether it is
so in the MS. The writing is so indistinct, that it is impossible to
read the title correctly. It is hardly necessary to remind the reader
that the poem is in the form of a dialogue between the bard, whoever
he may be, and St. Patrick. The name of the saint seems to have been a
favourite one with the bards, and was used no doubt to give consequence
and currency to their compositions.

[52] The crozier of St. Patrick. Several ancient Celtic croziers are
still in existence. Two are well known in Scotland. One of them is the
Quigrich, or crozier of St. Fillan, now in possession of a family of
the name of Dewar in Canada, to whose progenitor it was intrusted by
Robert Bruce at the battle of Bannockburn. An interesting notice of
this relic has recently been published by Dr. D. Wilson of Toronto.
Another is the crozier of St. Munn, now in the Museum of the Society of
Antiquaries in Scotland, and long in possession of a family called the
Barons of Bachul (a _crozier_, from the Latin _Baculus_), in the island
of Lismore. A notice of this relic will be found in the transactions
of the Scottish Antiquaries, from the able pen of Mr. Cosmo Innes. The
word ‚Äúbreac,‚Äù or _spotted_, applied to the crozier, must refer to its
ornamentation. The term will be found elsewhere applied to spears or
swords.

    Since without guile thou art,
    And now that they are dead, dost live,
    Watch thou for ever on,
    And tell the deeds done by the Feine.

    Should I be spared for fifty years,
    Hearing thy music in thy cell
    Till my death‚Äôs day, I could not tell
    The noble deeds of the Feine of Finn.
    The kingdoms of the earth in all its breadth
    Belonged to us on every side.
    Tribute we raised from all of them for Finn,[53]
    Else filled them with the shout of war.
    In this wide earth there was not one
    That dared refuse us,
    Not ev‚Äôn in Alve[54] of the spotted spears,
    With all its power and its untold renown.

[53] This is a curious piece of Bardic exaggeration. But there may be
some history hidden within its folds. There is sufficient evidence to
prove that the F√©ine, whoever they were, were not confined to Ireland.
We have numerous ancient Celtic compositions in which reference is made
to the F√©ine of Scotland, and the F√©ine of Britain, meaning either
Wales, or England and Wales together. The truth with regard to Finn and
his F√©ine seems even yet to be a long way off.

[54] This is said to be ‚ÄúAlmhuin,‚Äù or Allen, the residence of Finn,
according to Irish accounts, in the county of Kildare. The word has
a strong resemblance to ‚ÄúAlba,‚Äù the Gaelic name for Scotland; and in
reading ancient Gaelic MSS., care must be taken to distinguish the two.
We give the name in the Dean‚Äôs orthography, whatever the place may be.

    Would‚Äôst thou but tell them now,
    Ossian, of the fierce assaults,
    Which was the stoutest arm
    Among the men that followed Finn.

    Thou sett‚Äôst me to a painful task,
    O Priest, thou pupil of the heavenly king,
    I could not till the judgment day,
    Tell of the Feine, the men and deeds.

    Yet since it so fell out that thou outliv‚Äôst them
    Ossian of sweet and pleasing songs,
    Which would‚Äôst thou chuse of all the Feinn,
    To stand in battle by thy shield?

    Oscar and Caoilte and Gaul,
    And Luthy‚Äôs son, of sharpest swords;
    Round Cumhal‚Äôs son,[55] they well might stand,
    No nobler band in battle fought;
    Bloody Fargon, son to the king,
    And Carroll with the murderous spear;
    Dermin, brave and fair, who nothing feared,
    And bore his pointed shield aloft,
    Coll Caoilte‚Äôs son, so gentle at the feast;
    Corc, a warrior of no tender blows;
    Ryno, son to the king;--
    A band than which no braver fought.
    The fair-haired Fillan, who was son to Finn,
    And Garry, than whom no bloodier foe;
    The guileless Dyrin, Doveran‚Äôs son,
    Hugh, son of Garry of the powerful arm,
    I, myself, and Gaul the son of Smail,
    And Daire of oaken frame, brave Ronan‚Äôs son;
    The armourer‚Äôs three sons, men without guile,
    Whose ruddy armour gleamed, adorned with gold.
    Now that I tell my tale to thee,
    Cleric that dwell‚Äôst at Port-na-minna,
    No man of all the Feine was known to me
    But one, to whom all other men must yield.
    But, now, do thou be seated in thy chair,
    Take up thy pen, we‚Äôll number all the host,
    The host of brave and noble men
    Who came, well-ordered bands, unto the Feine.
    Across the sea the King of Lochlin came,
    The brown-haired[56] Daire of famous shield,
    From Conn to wrest the tribute paid by Erin,
    A mournful tale for us and all our host.
    Our Feinn had friends who came to give them aid,
    Men from the sides of every hill,
    Led on by Cairbar of the sinewy arm.
    Of these four bands came safe to land.
    Of the Feinn themselves came seven bands,
    Three from the east, the half of Erin called from Conn.[57]
    The greater number in the battle fell,
    But few escaped the bands of Daire donn.
    Down with his fleet lay Daire donn
    Himself and all his host.
    Of these were thirty score[58]
    Who ne‚Äôer again did see their native land.
    There watched them near the shore
    Conn Crithear of the well-aimed strokes.
    He seized the men of India there,
    And raised the king‚Äôs head on the mountain side.
    This famous Conn, the son of Ulster‚Äôs king,
    And Dollir, no less famed for warlike deeds,
    We left upon the strand,
    Drowned in mutual clasp beneath the waves.
    Dathach‚Äôs three sons, no braver men,
    Ascending from the place where lay the ships,
    Feartan and Kerkal, he with the large round head,
    We left their bodies naked on the strand.
    Owar,[59] the armed daughter of the King of Greece,
    And Forna of the heavy sturdy blows
    We left, a vacant grin upon their faces.
    We knew no sorrow as we left them there.
    Four of the King of Lochlin‚Äôs sons we left,
    Slain by our fierce, resistless arms.
    The three Balas from Borrin in the east,
    Hardly escaped our murderous blows.
    Great as was the king of the world,
    Daire donn, with shield of purest white,
    We left his body, too, upon the strand,
    Slain by the blows of the victorious Feine.
    Of all the world‚Äôs hosts, brave though they were,
    None did escape the slaughter
    Except the King of France alone,
    Who, like a swallow as it grasps the air,
    Fled from fear of noble Oscar,
    And even once his sole ne‚Äôer touched the earth
    Until he got to Glenabaltan, as men relate;
    Then and there only did he find him rest.
    It was on Fintray‚Äôs strand, down at the sea,
    Our people made this slaughter,
    Of these, the kings of all the world,
    And drank our full of vengeance.
    Our fierce and conquering arms
    Laid many a noble warrior low;
    Many a sword and shield
    Lay shattered on the strand,
    The strand of Fintray of the port;
    Many dead bodies lay upon the earth,
    Many a hero with a vacant grin.
    Much was the spoil we gathered in the fight.
    Patrick, son of noble Alpin,
    Even of the Feine themselves, none did escape
    The fierce and murderous fight
    Except two ordered bands,
    Nor were their bodies whole.
    The sons of Boisgne[60] made one band of those,
    A race, with hands that knew no tender grasp,
    Then came the sons of Morn,[61] who with the sons of Smail
    Made up the second band.
    By thy hand, O noble Priest
    In that sore fight, there perished of our Feine
    Five well-trained bands
    Who left us for the strand.
    Thirty luckless bands,
    A thousand score in each,
    We numbered of the men of Daire donn,
    That never reached the waves.
    Were I to answer thee, O Priest,
    As thou desir‚Äôst to hear my every tale,
    Down to the time we[62] Gawra‚Äôs battle fought,
    We never lost our power.
    Then did we seize the ships;
    We took the heavy silver of the king,
    The gold, the garments, and the other spoil;
    Each half of Erin had its share.
    Holy Patrick of the relics,
    Shall I meet death within thy house of prayer?
    Cover thou my form with earth,
    Since thou knowest well my tale.

    Ossian, since thou art wearied now,
    Make thy peace, that thou may‚Äôst die,
    Take up thy prayer and ask for mercy,
    Early each day call on thy God,
    And when, on the judgment day, thou reachest Sion,
    Where all men shall be gathered,
    May Michael, Mary, and the Son of God
    Take thee kindly by the hand.

    May the Twelve Apostles, with their song of praise,
    Each holy cleric, and each prophet,
    Me save from hell,
    For I‚Äôve been very sinful in my day.
                                  Once on a time.[63]

[55] Finn was Cumhal‚Äôs son. The word is pronounced ‚ÄúFinn mac
C√∫il,‚Äù--very much as M‚ÄôDougal is pronounced in the speaking of Gaelic.
The writer has been led to think that traces of ‚ÄúCual‚Äù (Cumhal) might
be found in the King Coil of Ayrshire. The whole region about the scene
of Coil‚Äôs territory and sepulchre has been purely Celtic, and the grave
itself bears marks of being constructed in the early Celtic method.

[56] As already observed, Daire donn, or ‚ÄúDaire the brown,‚Äù is called
here the King of Lochlin.

[57] Ireland was divided into two great sections: the northern, called
Leth Chuinn, or Conn‚Äôs half, from Conn of the hundred battles, King of
Ulster; the southern, called Leth Mhogha, or Mogh‚Äôs half, called from
Mogha Nuadhat, King of Munster, both in the second century.

[58] The Celts always count by twenties up to 400. When a Highlander
speaks of 340 or 360 of anything, he uniformly says seventeen score or
eighteen score. The numbers given here are an instance of the poetic
license.

[59] This daughter of the King of Greece is well known in Celtic
tradition. In Mr. J. F. Campbell‚Äôs _Tales of the West Highlands_, vol.
ii. p. 470, it will be seen that traces of her existence are found
still in the island of Barra. Greece was not unknown to the ancients.
C√¶sar tells us that the Gauls, although not committing their religious
mysteries to paper, in common writing which was familiar to them, used
the Greek letters. This is a remarkable statement, and one of which
too little use has been made in discussing the social condition of the
early Gael. At the same time, we learn from the history of the Gallic
war that the literature of Gaul was drawn from Britain, at least her
priests studied there, which can have no other meaning.

[60] The race of the F√©ine to which Finn belonged. The Irish say they
occupied Leinster and the eastern part of Ulster.

[61] The race to which the famous Gaul belonged. They are said to
have occupied Connaught and the west of Ireland. These are the Irish
accounts, and must be taken as contributions to a correct elucidation
of the history of these events, if they have a real history.

[62] A poem on this famous battle will be found in a subsequent part of
this collection.

[63] It will be seen in this and the previous pieces, that the first
few lines are repeated at the close of every poem. This practice
is uniformly followed in all ancient Celtic Poetry, and is a sure
indication that we have reached the end of the piece.


The author of this is Ossian:


    Feeble this night is the power of my arm,
    My strength is no more as it was;
    No wonder though I should mourn,
    Poor old relic that I am;
    Sad that such should be my lot,
    Beyond all men who tread the earth,
    Wearily dragging stones along
    To the church on the hill of the priest.
    I have a tale which I would tell
    Regarding our people, O Patrick:
    Listen to Finn‚Äôs prediction.
    Shortly ere thou cam‚Äôst, O Priest,
    The hero was to build a fort,
    On Cuailgne‚Äôs[64] bare and rounded hill.
    He laid it on the Feine of Fail[65]
    Materials for the work to get.
    Two-thirds of all his famous fort
    He laid upon the sons of Morn;
    The other third he laid on me,
    And on the other sons of Boisgne.
    I answered, but not aright,
    The son of Cumhal, son of Trenmor.
    I said I would cast off his rule,
    And would submit to him no more.
    Then for long Finn held his peace,
    The hero hard to vanquish,
    He who knew no guile nor fear,
    When my answer he had heard,
    His words to me were these,
    The words of Finn, prince of the Feine:

[64] A hill said to be in the county of Armagh, celebrated in the
ancient poem of ‚ÄúTain bo Chuailgne,‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe cattle spoil of Cuilinn.‚Äù
It is said to have been here that Cuchullin resided, whence probably
his name, Cu Chuailgne, or Cuchullin, the Hound of Cuillinn. In Irish
History Cuchullin is said to have lived a couple of centuries previous
to the era of Fingal.

The reader may be reminded that there is a mountain in Skye called
Cuilinn, one of the grandest of the Scottish mountains. The person
from whom both this and the Irish hills of the name were called, is
said to have been Cuilionn, a Druidical priest of great fame. The word
means also the Holly tree, from whence the derivation is sufficiently
probable.

[65] ‚ÄúFail‚Äù is an ancient name for Ireland. The word signifies _fate_;
hence ‚ÄúInnisfail,‚Äù or the ‚ÄúIsland of fate,‚Äù or, more probably, ‚Äúthe
sacred island.‚Äù

    Thou shalt be dragging stones awhile
    Ere to thy mournful home thou goest.
    Then did I rise up in wrath,
    From Cumhal‚Äôs son of bloody sword.
    There followed me of all the Feine,
    The fourth battalion, hardy and brave.
    Then was I long with the Feine,
    On all things I my judgment gave.
    Many were there with me then,
    But now, alas, I‚Äôm feeble, feeble;
    I was counsellor to the Feine,
    In all emergencies, how feeble.
    How many men that do not know
    That on this earth I‚Äôm feeble, feeble.
    This night my body‚Äôs frame is feeble,
    Patrick, I believe thy words.
    My hands, my feet, and head,
    All of them are feeble, feeble.
                              Feeble, etc.


The author of this is Ossian:


    Here have I seen the Feine,
    I have seen Conan and Gaul,
    Finn, and Oscar my son,
    Ryno, Art, and brown-haired Diarmad,[66]
    Brave M‚ÄôLuy,[67] he of noble mien,
    The red-haired Garry,[68] also Hugh the less,
    Hugh Garry‚Äôs son, who never quailed,
    The three Finns, and with them Fead,
    Glass and Gow and Garry,
    The long-haired Galve, and the impetuous Conan;[69]
    Gaul and Crooin, Gaul‚Äôs son,
    Socach, the son of Finn, and Bran;[70]
    Caoilte, the son of warlike Ronan,[71]
    Who swiftest ran, and leaped o‚Äôer valleys,
    The readiest to scatter gold,
    One of them of sweetest voice;
    Bayne, son of Brassil of the swords,
    The son of Cromchin, son of Smail,
    And Oscar, son of powerful Garry,[72]
    The three Balas, and the three Skails,
    Three battalions from Glenstroil,
    Three bands from Monaree;
    Caoilte‚Äôs seven sons best trained to fight;
    The three named Glass from Glassrananseir;
    The three Beths from Cnokandurd,
    Three of unfailing excellence;
    Deach Fichid‚Äôs son from Borruinn mor,
    Of them who always conquered.
    Here have I seen the Feine
    Whose liberal hand did music buy,[73]
    Ranged around Ossian and Finn,
    Traversing valleys to dispense their gold.
    Fearton and brave Carroll were there,
    Who never fought but where they won.
    I sing them, and generous Felan,
    All of whom here have I seen.
                          Here have I seen.

[66] Diarmad was the Adonis of the Feine. He is celebrated for his
beauty, which led finally to his death, as will be seen in a future
poem. He is said to have been the Ancestor of the clan Campbell, who
are hence called ‚ÄúClann Diarmaid,‚Äù or the ‚Äúchildren of Diarmad.‚Äù The
M‚ÄôDiarmads, as well as some other subordinate clans, are also said to
be of the same stock.

[67] A grandson of Finn by his son Daire dearg. His mother‚Äôs name was
Luigheach, whence he was called the son of Luigheach, pronounced Luy.
He was a famous man among the Feine, according to Irish authorities.

[68] There were several among the Feine of this name. The name is
widely known in the topography of Scotland. There are two Rivers Garry,
two lochs, and two large rivers. These are found in Inverness-shire and
Perthshire.

[69] Conan is usually called ‚ÄúConan maol,‚Äù or ‚ÄúConan the bald,‚Äù
and was known among the Feine for his thoughtless impetuosity. He
was, in consequence of this peculiar temperament, ever getting into
difficulties, and exposing himself to the ridicule and reprehension of
his companions. There are both a river and valley in Scotland called
after him, the River Conan and Strathconan in Rosshire.

[70] ‚ÄúBran,‚Äù the name of Finn‚Äôs celebrated hound, is here obviously the
name of a man. There is a ‚Äústrath‚Äù or valley in Rosshire which still
retains his name, Strathbran. The extent to which Fenian names are
found in Scottish topography, goes far to show the close connexion of
the Feine themselves with that country.

[71] Caoilte was one of the most famous of the Feine. He was
distinguished for his swiftness, and not without reason, as is shown
in his chase of Loinn mac Liobhaidh, the Fenian blacksmith, whom he
overtook, although he could cross a valley at a stride.

[72] This Oscar must be distinguished from the famous Oscar, the Poet‚Äôs
son. Of the latter he never speaks without applying to him some term of
endearment, as ‚Äúmy son,‚Äù ‚Äúmy own son,‚Äù etc.

[73] This line refers to the liberal rewards which the Bards usually
received among the Celts. A eulogy was sometimes rewarded by the Chief
with a silver cup. Even poetry had need to be purchased; and probably
were it not for the hope of reward of some kind, many of the noblest
Poems which have adorned human history would never have seen the light.
At a meeting of Skye gentlemen on some public occasion some years
ago, the question was put, ‚ÄúWhere are the bards?‚Äù One of the company
replied, ‚ÄúThey are gone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Nicolson of Scorrybreck, ‚Äúthey are
still with us; but the men who fostered them are gone.‚Äù


The author of this is Ossian, the son of Finn.[74]


[74] This piece is what is usually called ‚ÄúUrnuidh Oisiain,‚Äù or
‚ÄúOssian‚Äôs prayer.‚Äù There are many such colloquies in the Gaelic, many
of them bearing no marks of great antiquity. It will be found that
in the Gaelic the poem is divided. This arose from a misplacing of
different parts of it in the MS., which was not observed till the first
part was printed off. In the English the whole is given consecutively.

    Tell us, O Patrick, what honour is ours,
    Do the Feine of Ireland in heaven now dwell?

    In truth I can tell thee, thou Ossian of fame,
    That no heaven has thy father, Oscar, or Gaul.

    Sad is the tale thou tellest me, Priest,
    I worshipping God while the Feine have no heaven.

    Shalt thou not fare well thyself in that city,
    Though ne‚Äôer should thy father, Caoilte, and Oscar be there?

    Little joy would it bring to me to sit in that city,
    Without Caoilte, and Oscar, as well as my father.

    Better see the face of heaven‚Äôs son each day,
    Than all the gold on earth, were it thine to possess.

    Tell us, thou Priest of the Holy city, the tale;
    In return I‚Äôll recount thee the battle of Gaura.

    If the tale of that city thou desir‚Äôst, old man,
    No thirst, no hunger, want, reproach are there.

    Who are heaven‚Äôs sons? more noble are the Feinn:
    Are they hard of heart? have thou mercy, Cleric;

    Unlike them are the Feine, unlike them altogether,
    Never on the green plain did they seek the chase.

    For thy love‚Äôs sake, Patrick, forsake not the heroes,
    Unknown to heaven‚Äôs King, bring thou in the Feinn.

    Though little room you‚Äôd take, not one of your race,
    Unknown to heaven‚Äôs King, shall get beneath his roof.

    How different Mac Cumhail, the Feinn‚Äôs noble king,
    All men, uninvited, might enter his great house.

    Sad is that, old man, and thy life‚Äôs close so near,
    That thou should‚Äôst so unjustly judge of my great king.

    Better the fierce conflict of Finn and his Feinn,
    Than thy holy master, and thyself together.

    Mournful, poor old man, that thou should‚Äôst folly speak,
    Better God for a day than all of Erin‚Äôs Feinn.

    Though few be my days, and my life‚Äôs close near,
    Patrick defame not the nobles of clan Boisgne.

    Thou can‚Äôst never tell, Ossian, son to the Queen,
    How different your nobles from those of my Lord.

    Were even Conan living, the least of the Feinn,
    He would not suffer thy insolence, Cleric.

    Speak not thus, Ossian, savage are thy words,
    Take thee now thy rest, and guide thee by my rule.

    Did‚Äôst thou see the fight, and the noble banners,
    Never would‚Äôst thou think but of the glory of the Feinn.

    Ossian, Prince‚Äôs son, ‚Äôtwill be thy soul‚Äôs great loss
    That thou now think‚Äôst only of the battles of the Feinn.

    Did‚Äôst thou hear the hounds, and the sounds of the hunt,
    Thou would‚Äôst rather be there than in the holy city.

    That is sad, old man, if the glory of the chase
    Be greater than all which Heaven above can yield.

    Say not so, Patrick, empty are thy words,
    Indeed and in truth, better Finn and the Feinn.

    By thy hand, Boisgne‚Äôs son, not empty are my words,
    Better is one angel than Finn and the Feinn.

    Were I only now as I was at Gaura‚Äôs fight,
    I would punish thy reproach of Erin‚Äôs noble Feinn.

    Thy pride is all gone, for all thy future days,
    None are now left of thy band but thyself.

    Were my men in life I‚Äôd not hear thy howling,
    And I‚Äôd make thee to suffer in return for thy talk.

    Though all of these yet lived, and were now joined together,
    I‚Äôd still not speak only of the Feinn‚Äôs seven bands.

    Seven times the number that thou hast of priests,
    Fell all in battle by Oscar alone.

    Thou‚Äôrt now in thy last days, old and senseless man,
    Cease now thy speaking, and come away with me;
    Did‚Äôst thou see the men of cowls, Finn‚Äôs son, in Alve,
    Thou would‚Äôst not as thou dost reproach the men of heaven.

    No less was our great band, when we were met in Taura,
    Reproachful are the words thou speak‚Äôst of the great king,
    I will forgive thee, Cleric, although thou dost not tell.
                                                        Tell.


The author of this is Ossian.[75]


    I know a little tale of Finn,
    A tale that we should not despise,
    Of Cumhal‚Äôs son, the valorous,
    Which our memory still preserves.
    Once we were a little band,
    At Essaroy,[76] of gentle streams,
    Near the coast was under sail,
    A currach, in which sat a maid;
    Fifty men stood by the King,
    Brave in any fight or field,
    Sad for them who faced their right arm,
    For we ruled in every land.
    All of us rose up in haste,
    Save Finn of the Feine and Gaul,
    To welcome the boat as it sped,
    Cleaving the waves in its course.
    It never ceased its onward way
    Until it reached the wonted port.
    Then when it had touched the land,
    The maid did from her seat arise,
    Fairer than a sunbeam‚Äôs sheen,
    Of finest mould and gentlest mien.
    Then before this stranger maid,
    We stood and showed courtesy;
    ‚ÄúCome to the tent of Finn with us.‚Äù
    With grace she all of us salutes;
    ‚ÄôTwas Cumhal‚Äôs son himself replied,
    And salutes her in return.
    Then did the King of noblest mien
    Ask of the maid of fairest face,
    ‚ÄúWhence is it thou hast come, fair maid?
    Give us now in brief thy tale.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúThe King of the land beneath the waves,[77]
    My father is, such is my fate,
    Through all lands where the sun revolves,
    Thee and thy men I long have sought.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúPrincess, who hast searched each land,
    Youthful maid of beauteous form,
    The reason why thou cam‚Äôst so far,
    Tell us now, and tell us all.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúIf thou be Finn, I ask defence,‚Äù[78]
    So now did speak the youthful maid,
    ‚ÄúThou of soft speech, and purest race,
    Grant me protection, grant it now.‚Äù
    Then spoke the wise and knowing King,
    ‚ÄúTell us now from whom thou flee‚Äôst;
    Protection I thee grant, fair maid,
    ‚ÄôGainst every man that dares thee hurt.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúThere comes in wrath across the sea,
    Swift in pursuit, a warrior brave,
    The well-armed son of Sorcha‚Äôs King,
    He whose name is Daire the fierce.[79]
    I laid me under heavy bonds[80]
    That Finn should from the sea me have,
    But that his wife I ne‚Äôer should be,
    Though famed his beauty and his deeds.‚Äù
    Then Oscar spoke, of hasty speech,
    The warlike conqueror of Kings,
    ‚ÄúThough Finn should not thy pledge sustain,
    Never shalt thou with him wed.‚Äù
    Then do we see borne by his steed[81]
    A hero of unequalled size,
    Travelling with speed across the sea,
    Following the maiden in her course;
    His helmet close about the head
    Of this brave and dauntless man;
    His right arm bore a round black shield,
    The surface of its back engraved;
    A heavy, large, broad-bladed sword,
    Tightly bound, hung by his side;
    He comes in attitudes of fence,
    As where we stood he swift approached;
    Two javelins, with victory rich,
    Rest on the shoulder of his shield;
    For strength, for skill, for bravery,
    Nowhere could his match be found.
    A hero‚Äôs look,--the eye of a king
    Shone in that head of noblest mould,
    Ruddy his face, his teeth pearl-white,
    No stream ran swifter than his steed.
    Then did his steed bound on the shore,
    And he in whom we saw no fear.
    Of us did fifty warriors then
    Approach him as he came to us;
    Fear of the hero as he neared us
    Filled the bravest of them all.
    Now as he landed from the waves,
    Our famous King the question put,
    ‚ÄúCan‚Äôst thou tell me now, fair maid,
    Is that the man of whom thou spak‚Äôst?‚Äù
    ‚ÄúI know him well, Finn Cumhal‚Äôs son,
    Nor does his coming bode you good;
    Me he will rudely strive to seize,
    Despite thy strength, O noble Finn.‚Äù
    Then Oscar and Gaul arose,
    The fiercest of all in the fight,
    Near to the men they firmly stood,
    Between the giant and our chief.
    The well-formed warrior then approached,
    In rage sustained by his great strength,
    The maid he rudely bears away,
    Though by Finn‚Äôs shoulder she had stood.
    The Son of Morne then hurled his spear,
    With wonted force, as he bore off;
    No gentle cast was that, in truth,
    The hero‚Äôs shield was split in twain.
    The wrathful Oscar then did shake
    The red-dyed belt from his left arm,[82]
    And killed the hero‚Äôs prancing steed,
    A deed most worthy of great fame.
    Then, when the steed fell on the plain,
    He on us turned in fiercest wrath,
    And battle does, the onset mad,
    With all our fifty warriors brave.
    On the same side with me and Finn,
    The fifty stood in front of him:
    Yet though they oft stood firm in fight,
    His arm did now them force to yield.
    Two blows, and only two he gave,
    With vigour to each sep‚Äôrate man,
    When we were stretched upon the earth,
    Each man of us with whom he fought.
    Three vanquished nines he tightly bound,
    Ere from the furious fight he ceased.
    Firmly the three smalls‚Äô[83] usual tie
    On each of these he firmly placed.
    Then did the manly Gaul advance,
    The conquering hero to assail.
    Whoe‚Äôer he was could see them then,
    The struggle and the fight were fierce.
    Then did Mac Morne slay with his arm
    The King of Sorcha‚Äôs son, most strange!
    Sad was the coming of the maid,
    Now that the brave in fight had fallen.
    And now that he had fallen thus,
    Beside the sea, a sad event,
    She of the land beneath the waves,
    With Finn and his Feine remained a year.
    Flann, son of Morne, in battle brave,
    Was killed, it is a piteous tale;
    None of all our men escaped,
    Whose body was not full of wounds,
    Except my noble Father, Finn,
    The generous friend of all distressed.
    And now at last the deed is done.
    Of Finn this little tale I know.
                    I know a little tale of Finn.

    As our fifty warriors brave[84]
    Were now subject to his arms,
    Helpless were we in his hands,
    Our precious rights were all now lost.
    His sword without a single check,
    Did hack our bodies and our shields.
    Any fighting like to his,
    In my day never have I seen.
    We buried then close to the fall
    This noble, brave, and powerful man.
    And on each finger‚Äôs ruddy point
    A ring was placed in honour of the King.
    For ten long years his conquering arms,
    To the victor did the King forbid;
    For all that time the son of Morne
    Was healing with Finn of the Feine.

[75] This composition is known usually by the name of ‚ÄúFainesoluis,‚Äù
or the sunbeam, derived manifestly from the comparison of the sunbeam
in the twenty-first line. In Ireland it is called ‚ÄúLaoidh an Mhoighre
Bhoirb,‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe song of Mayre Borb.‚Äù The ‚ÄúMayre‚Äù of Ireland will be
found to be ‚ÄúDaire‚Äù in Scotland.

[76] The topography of these poems is a subject of very deep interest
to the student of our national antiquities. In the valley of the Roy
in Lochaber, so famous for its parallel roads, is a waterfall called
‚ÄúEas ruaidh,‚Äù or ‚ÄúEssaroy,‚Äù the ‚Äúfall of Roy.‚Äù Was this the scene of
the story of Fainesoluis? It may be objected that from there the sea
lies at a distance of fifteen miles. On the Earn, near Ballyshannon,
in the county of Donegal, is ‚ÄúAssaroe,‚Äù or ‚ÄúEas Aoidh Ruaidh,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe
waterfall of Hugh the red,‚Äù who was drowned there. This is nearer the
sea; but at the period ascribed to Ossian, the name could not have been
given to the spot, as the death of Aedh ruadh mac Badhairn, from whom
the cascade was named, occurred, according to the Four Masters, in A.M.
4518.

[77] Kings among the Celts were, at an early period, persons of much
less consequence than the name would now seem to imply. In Ireland,
there were four provincial sovereignties besides the national one.
But even this does not give an accurate representation of the Celtic
polity. The fact is, every ruler of a district and leader of an army
was called a King. Of this we have ample evidence in C√¶sar‚Äôs account of
the state of Britain at the period of the Roman invasion. In Scotland,
tradition points to several kingdoms. In the Western Highlands the
Island of Mull is said to have formed a kingdom by itself, called
‚ÄúRioghachd na Drealluin,‚Äù ‚Äúthe Kingdom of Drealinn,‚Äù from ‚Äúdreall,‚Äù a
‚Äúbar‚Äù or ‚Äúsneck,‚Äù applied to the Sound of Mull, which shuts out all
strangers from the Island. Islay was called ‚ÄúRioghachd Modheadh,‚Äù
or the ‚ÄúSouthwest Kingdom,‚Äù from its position. Morvern was called
‚ÄúIorruaidh,‚Äù to which frequent reference is made both in Scottish and
Irish Celtic tradition. Ardnamurchan was called ‚ÄúSorcha,‚Äù the kingdom
of Daire Borb‚Äôs father, from its mountainous character, ‚ÄúSorcha‚Äù
meaning ‚Äúhigh,‚Äù whence ‚Äúsorchan,‚Äù ‚Äúa tripod.‚Äù ‚ÄúTir b√†r fo thuinn,‚Äù or
the land beneath the waves, was Tyree, from the lowness of the land
appearing from a distance as if its surface were on a level with the
sea. If there be any historical accuracy in these traditions, which
have been gathered up from an intelligent old Highlander, skilled in
the lore of his country, this story of Fainesoluis is one in which a
daughter of the ruler of the Island of Tyree is pursued by a son of the
ruler of Ardnamurchan. Poetry gives a consequence and magnitude to the
event, which in all probability the naked reality did not possess.

[78] ‚ÄúMo chomraich ort,‚Äù ‚Äúmy protection be on thee,‚Äù was an appeal
which the Celtic warrior could never reject when made by the weak and
helpless. In Christian times, the word ‚ÄúComraich‚Äù came to be applied to
the ‚Äúgirths‚Äù or ‚Äúsanctuaries‚Äù around places of worship and other sacred
spots, where accused persons might flee for security. Hence the Gaelic
name of the parish of Applecross in Rosshire, ‚ÄúA Chomraich,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe
Sanctuary,‚Äù formed round the church dedicated to St. Malrube, an early
Christian missionary.

[79] As already observed, this name is in Irish editions of the poem
‚ÄúMayre.‚Äù See Miss Brooks‚Äô ‚Äú_Reliques of Irish Poetry_.‚Äù

[80] ‚ÄúGeasan,‚Äù ‚Äúbonds.‚Äù The word here appears to mean a simple pledge,
although in most cases it implies the exercise of some magical power.
In those cases of metamorphosis so common in Celtic tales, the persons
who have been made to undergo the change are said to be ‚Äúfo gheasaibh,‚Äù
‚Äúunder spells.‚Äù The mythology of the Celts has much in common with that
of Eastern nations.

[81] The magical steed of Daire borb was capable of carrying its master
over sea and land. In many ancient Celtic Tales we read of ships which
could also traverse sea and land.

[82] The word in the original here is ‚Äúcriss zerk,‚Äù the ‚Äúred belt.‚Äù
This is, however, in all probability, a mistake of the Dean‚Äôs for
‚Äúcraoiseach,‚Äù a ‚Äújavelin.‚Äù It is not easy to see what could be meant by
the ‚Äúred belt‚Äù on Oscar‚Äôs left arm. It could hardly signify the straps
of the shield. If it be ‚Äúcraoiseach,‚Äù the bard would seem to indicate
that Oscar was left-handed, like the sons of Benjamin.

[83] ‚ÄúNa tri caoil,‚Äù or the ‚Äúthree smalls,‚Äù were the neck, the ankles,
and the wrists. Prisoners of war had this triple binding applied to
them.

[84] These supplementary lines would appear to be either additional
lines or various readings. There are two given in the Gaelic, which
are not translated, as being of little consequence, and which seem
intended to come in between the ninety-eighth and ninety-ninth lines.
The first eight lines of this additional fragment are probably intended
to fall in between the hundred and twenty-eighth and the hundred and
twenty-ninth lines, the last eight to close the poem. Dr. Smith, in the
Report on Ossian‚Äôs Poems given in to the Highland Society, states, that
the Edition given in this supplement is inconsistent with that in the
body of the Poem, and must be held to contain various readings.


The author of this is Ossian, the son of Finn.[85]


    ‚ÄôTwas yesterday week
    I last saw Finn;
    Ne‚Äôer did I see
    A braver man;
    Teige‚Äôs[86] daughter‚Äôs son,
    A powerful king;
    My fortune, my light,
    My mind‚Äôs whole might,
    Both poet and chief.
    Braver than kings,
    Firm chief of the Feinn.
    Lord of all lands,
    Leviathan at sea,
    As great on land,
    Hawk of the air,
    Foremost always.
    Generous, just,
    Despised a lie.
    Of vigorous deeds,
    First in song.
    A righteous judge,
    Firm his rule.
    Polished his mien,
    Who knew but victory.
    Who is like him
    In fight or song?
    Resists the foe,
    In house or field.
    Marble his skin,
    The rose his cheek,
    Blue was his eye,
    His hair like gold.
    All men‚Äôs trust,
    Of noble mind.
    Of ready deeds,
    To women mild,
    A giant he,
    The field‚Äôs delight.
    Best polished spears,
    No wood like their shafts.
    Rich was the King.
    His great green bottle,
    Full of sharp wine,
    Of substance rich.
    Excellent he.[87]
    Of noble form,
    His people‚Äôs head,
    His step so firm,
    Who often warred.
    In beauteous Banva,
    Three hundred battles
    He bravely fought.
    With miser‚Äôs mind
    From none withheld.
    Anything false
    His lips ne‚Äôer spoke.
    He never grudged,
    No, never Finn;
    The sun ne‚Äôer saw King
    Who him excelled.
    The monsters in lakes,
    The serpent by land,
    In Erin of saints,[88]
    The hero slew.
    Ne‚Äôer could I tell,
    Though always I lived,
    Ne‚Äôer could I tell
    The third of his praise.
    But sad am I now,
    After Finn of the Feinn!
    Away with the chief,
    My joy is all fled.
    No friends ‚Äômong the great,
    No courtesy.
    No gold, no queen,
    No princes and chiefs.
    Sad am I now,
    Our head ta‚Äôen away!
    I‚Äôm a shaking tree,
    My leaves all gone.
    An empty nut,
    A reinless horse,
    Sad, sad am I,
    A feeble kern.
    Ossian I, the son of Finn,
    Strengthless in deed.
    When Finn did live
    All things were mine.
    Seven sides had the house
    Of Cumhal‚Äôs son.
    Seven score shields
    On every side.
    Fifty robes of wool
    Around the King.
    Fifty warriors
    Filled the robes.
    Ten bright cups
    For drink in his hall.
    Ten blue flagons,
    Ten horns of gold.
    A noble house
    Was that of Finn.
    No grudge nor lust,
    Babbling nor sham;
    No man despised
    Among the Feinn.
    The first himself,
    All else like him.
    Finn was our chief,
    Easy his praise,
    Noblest of Kings.
    Finn ne‚Äôer refused
    To any man,
    Howe‚Äôer unknown;
    Ne‚Äôer from his house
    Sent those who came.[89]
    Good man was Finn,
    Good man was he.
    No gifts e‚Äôer given
    Like his so free.
                ‚ÄôTwas yesterday week.

[85] The following seems to have been Ossian‚Äôs eulogy on his father
Finn. The editor has not met with any similar composition either
among Scottish or Irish collections, except a few lines extracted by
Miss Brooks from a composition which she calls ‚ÄúBuille Oisein,‚Äù and
it is therefore rescued from oblivion by having been seized by the
Dean while floating on the stream of oral tradition, and treasured in
his miscellany. In the original, the poetry is worthy of the name of
Ossian, more so, indeed, than any of the pieces in this collection.
It is quite impossible to produce in English the effect of the rhythm
and alliteration of the Gaelic; but the editor has endeavoured, while
giving an exact rendering, to retain, in as far as possible, the
peculiar measure of the original. The piece is a fine tribute of filial
love and admiration, nor is there much room to doubt its genuineness.

[86] Muirne Finn‚Äôs mother is said to have been a daughter of Teige, a
famous Druid, or, as others say, of a princely family of Bregia, in
Meath.

[87] Some of the lines in this part of the original MS. are very
much defaced from age and bad usage. The editor has been obliged in
consequence to guess one line and a few additional words. The line is
the forty-fifth, where he has introduced a phrase sufficiently general
to prevent the charge of in any measure tampering with his author. The
other words will be seen by referring to the Gaelic.

[88] The word ‚Äúnaoimh,‚Äù here translated ‚Äúsaints,‚Äù is not necessarily
associated with Christianity. The word ‚Äúnaomh,‚Äù _holy_, is one
belonging originally to the Gaelic language, and not introduced, like
many ecclesiastical terms, from the Latin and Greek. The phrase may
be rendered ‚Äúsacred Erin,‚Äù a character belonging to the island, in
popular belief, even previous to the Christian period. It is a curious
fact, that the feat of destroying all the vermin in Ireland was, in a
later age, attributed to St. Patrick. It would appear that this was
but a transference of a portion of the glory of Finn to the Christian
Saint,--a remarkable instance among many of early Christianity
borrowing, not very wisely, the laurels of heathenism.

[89] Hospitality was one of the highest qualifications of a Celtic
chief. Ossian never fails to sing the generous, open-handed hospitality
of his father Finn. Till a late period the same feature of character
distinguished the Scottish Highlander, although modern civilisation
is fast uprooting it, and overlaying the character of the simple
Highlander with the selfishness peculiar to itself. Even now, in
most part of the Highlands, the door of a hut is never closed by
day,--a practice said to originate in the universal sense of the ready
reception due to the wayfarer and the stranger. Is the _seven_ sides of
Fingal‚Äôs house an orientalism?


The author of this is Allan M‚ÄôRorie.[90]


    Glenshee,[91] the vale that close beside me lies,
    Where sweetest sounds are heard of deer and elk,
    And where the Feinn did oft pursue the chase,
    Following their hounds along the lengthening vale.
    Below the great Ben Gulbin‚Äôs[92] grassy height
    Of fairest knolls that lie beneath the sun,
    The valley winds. Its streams did oft run red,
    After a hunt by Finn and by the Feinn.
    Listen now while I detail the loss
    Of one, a hero in this gentle band:
    ‚ÄôTis of Ben Gulbin, and of generous Finn,
    And Mac O‚ÄôDuine,[93] in truth a piteous tale.
    A mournful hunt indeed it was for Finn,
    When Mac O‚ÄôDuine, he of the ruddiest hue,
    Up to Ben Gulbin went, resolved to hunt
    The boar,[94] whom arms had never yet subdued.
    Though Mac O‚ÄôDuine, of brightest burnished arms,
    Did bravely slay the fierce and furious boar,
    Yet Finn‚Äôs deceit did him induce to yield;
    And this it was that did his grievous hurt.
    Who among men was so beloved as he?
    Brave Mac O‚ÄôDuine, beloved of the schools;[95]
    Women all mourn this sad and piteous tale
    Of him who firmly grasped the murderous spear.
    Then bravely did the hero of the Feinn
    Rouse from his cover in the mountain side,
    The great old Boar, him so well known in Shee,
    The greatest in the wild boar‚Äôs haunt e‚Äôer seen.
    Glad now was Finn, the man of ruddiest hue,
    Beneath Ben Gulbin‚Äôs soft and grassy side;
    For swift the boar now coursed along the heath;
    Great was the ill came of that dreadful hunt.
    ‚ÄôTwas when he heard the Feinn‚Äôs loud ringing shout,
    And saw approach the glittering of their arms,
    The monster waken‚Äôd from his heavy sleep,
    And stately moved before them down the vale.
    First, to distance them he makes attempt,
    The great old boar, his bristles stiff on end,
    These bristles sharper than a pointed spear,
    Their point more piercing than the quiver‚Äôs shaft.
    Then Mac O‚ÄôDuine with arms well pointed too,
    Answers the horrid beast with ready hand:
    Away from his side there rushed the heavy spear,
    Hard following on the course the boar pursued.
    The javelin‚Äôs shaft fell shivered into three,
    The shaft recoiling from the boar‚Äôs tough hide.
    The spear hurled by his warm red-fingered hand
    Ne‚Äôer penetrated the body of the boar.
    Then from its sheath he drew his thin-leaved[96] sword,
    Of all the arms most crown‚Äôd with victory;
    Mac O‚ÄôDuine did there the monster kill,
    While he himself escaped without a wound.
    Then on Finn of the Feinn did sadness fall,
    And on the mountain side he sat him down;
    It grieved his soul that generous Mac O‚ÄôDuine
    Should have escaped unwounded by the boar.
    For long he sat, and never spake a word,
    Then thus he spake, although ‚Äôt be sad to tell,
    ‚ÄúMeasure, Diarmad, the boar down from the snout,
    And tell how many feet ‚Äôs the brute in length.‚Äù
    What Finn did ask he never yet refused;
    Alas! that he should never see his home.
    Along the back he measures now the boar,
    Light-footed Mac O‚ÄôDuine of active step.
    ‚ÄúMeasure it the other way against the hair,
    And measure, Diarmad, carefully the boar.‚Äù
    It was indeed for thee a mournful deed,
    Youth of the sharply-pointed piercing arms.
    He went, the errand grievous was and sad,
    And measured for them once again the boar.
    Th‚Äô envenomed pointed bristle sharply pierced
    The sole of him,[97] the bravest in the field.
    Then fell and lay upon the grassy plain
    The noble Mac O‚ÄôDuine, whose look spoke truth;
    He fell and lay along beside the boar,
    And there you have my mournful, saddening tale.
    There does he lie now wounded to the death,
    Brave Mac O‚ÄôDuine, so skilful in the fight;
    The most enduring ev‚Äôn among the Feinn,
    He lies upon the knoll I see on high,
    The blue-eyed hawk that dwelt at Essaroy,[98]
    The conqueror in every sore-fought field,
    Slain by the poisoned bristle of the boar.
    Now does he lie full stretched upon the hill,
    Brave, noble Diarmad Mac O‚ÄôDuine!
    Slain, it is shame! victim of jealousy.[99]
    Whiter his body than the sun‚Äôs bright light,
    Redder his lips than blossoms tinged with red;
    Long yellow locks did rest upon his head,
    His eye was clear beneath the covering brow,
    Its colour mingled was of blue and grey;
    Waving and graceful were his locks behind,[100]
    His speech was elegant and sweetly soft;
    His hands the whitest, fingers tipped with red;
    Elegance and power were in his form,
    His fair soft skin covering a faultless shape,
    No woman saw him but he won her love.
    Mac O‚ÄôDuine crowned with his countless victories,
    Ne‚Äôer shall he raise his eye in courtship more,
    Or warriors‚Äô wrath give colour to his cheek;
    The following of the chase, the prancing steed,
    Will never move him, nor the search for spoil.
    He who could bear him well in every fight,
    Has now us sadly left in that wild vale.
                                    Glenshee.

[90] This Poet is obviously a Scotchman; but judging from another of
his compositions in this volume, he was, like the Scottish bards of
his time, well acquainted with the bardic literature of Ireland. This
arose from the frequent intercourse between the two countries during
their early history, and the number of Scotchmen educated both in the
Medical and Bardic Schools of Ireland. This is one of the circumstances
which renders it so difficult now, in the absence of authentic
historical documents, to extricate much of the social history of the
two countries. Hence the rival Scottish and Irish claims to many of
our Celtic literary remains. There is no doubt that the poets of both
countries interwove with their compositions the traditions of the race,
without much regard to whether these were Scotch or Irish. The Irish
trace this common literature to the fact of the Irish colonization of
Scotland, which they maintain was the origin of the Celtic population
of the latter country; but it is by no means necessary to go so far
back in order to find sufficient cause for the fact. Christianity
seems to have formed the first solid basis of union between the two
countries, and a common Christianity was without doubt the means
of long maintaining it. This composition is usually called ‚ÄúB√†s
Dhiarmaid,‚Äù _The death of Diarmad_.

[91] A valley in the eastern part of Perthshire, where the grave
of Diarmad is pointed out to this day. M‚ÄôRorie appears to have
been an inhabitant of the neighbourhood, for he speaks of Glenshee
as being close beside him. The name of Glenshee is derived from
the word ‚ÄúGleann,‚Äù _a valley_, and ‚Äús√¨th,‚Äù _a hill_ of a peculiar
form. This word is found in the names of several Scottish hills, as
‚ÄúS√¨th challain,‚Äù _Schihallion_; ‚ÄúBeinn sh√¨th,‚Äù _Ben Hi_; ‚ÄúAn t-S√¨th
mh√≤r,‚Äù _the great pointed hill_. ‚ÄúS√¨than,‚Äù a hillock. The word has
been often mistaken for ‚ÄúS√¨th,‚Äù _peace_, whence the name ‚ÄúSitheach,
sithichean,‚Äù _a fairy, fairies_, has been absurdly rendered _the peace
folk_, instead of _the folk of the hills_, referring to their reputed
residence in earthen mounds.

[92] ‚ÄúBen Gulbin,‚Äù _the mountain of the beak_, lies at the head of
Glenshee. There is a hill with a similar name in Ireland, whence Conall
Gulbain, one of the kings of Ulster, took his designation. There is a
‚Äúwater of Gulbin,‚Äù and a ‚ÄúTorgulbin,‚Äù in the braes of Lochaber; but
the reference to Glenshee fixes the scene of the death of Diarmad in
Perthshire. There is, as is common in Highland topography, a stream
called Gulbin, whence a valley of the same name, and then a mountain.
The names in similar cases seem to have been primarily attached to the
streams, whence they ascended through the valleys to the hills. We have
an instance of this in the River Nevis, Glen Nevis, Ben Nevis, the
‚Äúneamhais,‚Äù referring to its impetuosity, having been in all likelihood
originally applied to the stream.

[93] Mac O‚ÄôDuine is the patronymic of Diarmad. Hence the Campbell clan,
besides being called ‚ÄúClann Diarmaid,‚Äù _The race of Diarmad_, are
called also ‚ÄúClann O‚ÄôD√πine,‚Äù or _The children of O‚ÄôDuine_.

[94] The chase of the boar was a favourite employment among the ancient
Celts. It is celebrated in many of their tales. Besides this, the sow
enters largely into their ancient mythology. Even in this case the boar
was possessed of magical properties, as will be seen in the subsequent
portion of this poem. It is not unlikely that at an early period the
Celts worshipped the sow like the Egyptians, whose worship of it might
have been one reason why it was pronounced unclean. Whether the Celts
worshipped it or not, it is manifest that it was held in high esteem,
for its figure is engraved on most of the ancient sculptured stones
of Scotland. Among the Welsh it is a national emblem, and hence one
argument for the ancient Picts being British, as these stones are found
confined to the ancient Pictish territory. The word ‚Äúmuc,‚Äù _a sow_,
enters largely into Scottish topography. We have ‚ÄúEilean nam muc,‚Äù the
_Isle of muck_, or _Sow island_. The ancient name of St. Andrews was
‚ÄúMuc ros,‚Äù _the Sow‚Äôs headland_, and we know that the sow is associated
with the memory of St. Regulus. There is a ‚ÄúBridge of Turk,‚Äù or _the
Boar‚Äôs bridge_, near the Trosachs. There is a ‚ÄúSlochd muice,‚Äù or the
_Sow‚Äôs hollow_, near Inverness, on the Highland road, a name derived
from a hillock shaped like a sow‚Äôs back, in the bottom of the chasm a
little to the west of where the coach road crosses; and there is ‚ÄúSr√≤n
muice,‚Äù _The Sow‚Äôs snout_, on the north side of Loch Ness, derived from
the resemblance of a hill-face to that part of the animal. These two
latter names are manifestly derived from natural resemblances, and have
nothing to do with mythology.

[95] The ‚Äúschools,‚Äù referred to frequently in Ossianic tales, were
probably military, although there can be no doubt that there was a
learned class among the ancient Celts. C√¶sar tells us, as already
observed, that the Gauls used the Greek letters, and that their priests
were educated in Britain. The ‚Äúoghum‚Äù character, whose antiquity is
pretty thoroughly established, is another evidence of ancient literary
cultivation.

[96] The Gaelic is ‚Äútan-lann,‚Äù the _thin sword_. Was this steel or
merely bronze? The thinness would seem to indicate steel.

[97] It is hardly necessary to point out the resemblance here between
the sole of Diarmad and the heel of Achilles. Achilles could only
be wounded in the heel, Diarmad only in the sole of the foot. The
Adonis of the ancient Greeks was slain by a boar. There are remarkable
analogies between classical and Celtic tradition.

[98] Essaroy, _vide supra_, p. 18, n. This is manifestly the Essaroy of
Scotland, which is in the heart of one of the finest hunting regions in
the world. Nor is it at any great distance from either of the Gulbins.

[99] Grainne, the wife of Finn, had formed an unlawful attachment to
Diarmad. The latter had what is called a ‚ÄúBall seirce,‚Äù or _beauty
spot_, which no woman could resist. Hence Finn‚Äôs jealousy and desire to
destroy Diarmad. The word rendered here ‚Äúnaire,‚Äù _shame_, is in the MS.
‚Äúnoor,‚Äù _gold_. If this be the accurate reading, Grainne‚Äôs dowery must
have formed an element in the conflict.

[100] Yellow was the favourite colour of the ancient Celt. ‚ÄúFalt
buidh,‚Äù _yellow hair_, is an object of the highest admiration, and
the longer and more waving the locks, the greater the admiration. The
account the Celt gives of himself is somewhat different from that given
by his neighbours, who would paint him a wiry, thin, black-haired,
black-eyed man. Tacitus gave a different description; and any man who
travels the Highlands of Perthshire, where, perhaps, we have the purest
Celtic blood in Scotland, will have ample evidence of the accuracy of
the Roman historian. With reference to the admiration of the yellow
colour among the Celts, it is interesting to trace how it intermingles
itself with the vocabulary of the language; thus, a _fine_ day is a
_yellow_ day. The name given to Beltin day, the opening of summer, is,
‚Äúla buidhe Beallteine,‚Äù _yellow Beltin day_; and anything propitious is
called _yellow_, as, ‚Äúis buidhe dhuit e,‚Äù _it is yellow or propitious
for you_; and a man satisfied after a meal is called ‚Äúbuidheach,‚Äù
_yellow or satisfied_.


The author of this is Allan M‚ÄôRory.[101]


    To-night my mourning is great,
    Thou tonsured priest whom I love,
    While I reflect on the fight,
    With red-tree[102] Cairbar we fought,
    Son to great Cormaig O‚ÄôCuinn,
    Woe to the Feinn whom he seized;
    A king who ne‚Äôer shunned the fight,
    And feared not the face of man.
    The Feinn to a man did serve,
    Finn and the good race of Conn,
    Till the day of Cairbar Roy;
    Nor evil nor weakness fear‚Äôd.
    Brave Cairbar his people addressed,
    Deceitful indeed was the speech.
    In battle would he choose to fall,
    The Feinn and he together,
    Ere even as a King he‚Äôd live
    With Erin beneath the Feinn.
    Barrin then spoke boldly out,

    Remember Muckrey[103] and Art;
    How your great ancestors fell,
    Resisting the Feinn‚Äôs deceit;
    Remember their cruel bonds,
    Remember their pride and guile;
    And that we ne‚Äôer knew of war,
    But such as was stirr‚Äôd by Mac C√πil.

    Then did the race of Conn resolve,
    In counsel with Cairbar Roy,
    That they‚Äôd at once assail us,
    And the whole of us destroy.
    They‚Äôd have days of joy and feasting,
    Great Alvin cleared of the Feinn.
    Then would all grief be dead,
    Nor could they a tax demand.
    Fiercely and bravely we fought,
    That fight the fight of Gaura;
    There did fall our noble Feinn,
    Sole to sole with Ireland‚Äôs kings.
    From India far in the east,
    To Fodla[104] here in the west,
    The kings did all own our sway,
    Till the battle of Gaura was fought.
    But since that horrid slaughter,
    No tribute nor tax we‚Äôve raised.
    Nor to us was tribute due,
    Save by part of Erin‚Äôs soil.
    Many were there on the earth
    Of the folk who felt no grief.
    To both sides how great the loss,
    When we each other did destroy,
    Should strangers fierce come over,
    And seize on beauteous Erin.

    Ossian, what would Finn have done
    Were burdens laid on Erin?

    By thy hand, most holy Priest,
    There were none in all fair Banva,[105]
    Save a few aged heroes,
    And some younger untried men;
    What king might there plant his foot,
    Could Fodla have for taking.
    No fight, no conflict he‚Äôd need,
    No stratagem nor struggle.

    Eastward we sent ambassadors,
    To Fatha of Con‚Äôs great son;
    That he might lead us on,
    To seize on Erin‚Äôs kingdom.

    Great grief had now come on you,
    From Tara‚Äôs loud-spoken King:
    New reason had ye given
    Why all of you should perish.

    Ossian, tell us now the tale,
    When ye fought that sturdy fight.
    Did thy son in battle die,
    Or had he speech when you him found?

    I bent me over valiant Oscar,
    Soon as was the slaughter o‚Äôer;
    Caoilte too did bend him o‚Äôer
    His seven valiant sons;
    Each living man among the Feinn
    Bent him o‚Äôer his own dear friends.
    Some of them had still their speech,
    From others life had parted.
    Priest of the crosier white,
    Whoever saw that slaughter,
    ‚ÄôTis an everlasting grief,
    Erin‚Äôs nobles thus to die.
    Many were the hard round shields,
    Many precious coats of mail,
    And lifeless warriors on the field.
    Nor would our people grieve for this
    Were they not a vanquished race.
    Little from that field was left us,
    Save a king‚Äôs or chieftain‚Äôs spoil.
    There found I my own dear son
    Laid, on his left arm resting,
    His shattered shield beside him,
    While his hand still grasped his sword;
    His precious blood on every side,
    Flowed swiftly through his harness.
    My spear I rested on the earth,
    And o‚Äôer him stood as he lay;
    Then thought I, O tonsured Priest,
    What, now lonely, I could do.
    Oscar towards me now turns,
    ‚ÄôTwas for me a grievous scene;
    Forth to me he stretched his hand,
    Wishing I should him approach.
    Then my dear son‚Äôs hand I seized,
    And cried out with a bitter cry.
    Forward from that time till now,
    In this world I‚Äôve useless been.
    Thus to me my own son said,
    As life was fast departing,

    Thanks to the powers above,
    That thou‚Äôst escaped, dear father.

    Nothing do I tell but truth,
    A word I could not answer.
    Then approached the noble Caoilte,
    Who to visit Oscar came.
    Gently did Mac Ronain[106] say,

    How find‚Äôst thou thyself, dear friend?

    Just as thou would‚Äôst have me be,
    Going to a better world.

    Cairbar Roy‚Äôs spear had pierced,
    ‚ÄôNeath the navel, red-armed Oscar;
    The arm of Caoilte up to its bend,
    Followed in its course the spear.
    Caoilte did deeply search the wound,
    And well saw how all stood there.
    The wound was through to the back,
    Torn by the murderous spear.
    Mac Ronain gave a loud shriek,
    And, fainting, fell to the earth.
    Then spake Caoilte, the warrior brave,
    Recovering from his faint,

    Dear Oscar, no more art thou ours;
    Thou and the Feinn must part,
    So part must the Feinn with war,
    Conn‚Äôs race the tribute shall raise.

    We had been thus a brief space,
    Thou priest, the son of Alpin,
    When leaving the slaughter we saw,
    All of Fail‚Äôs Feinn now living,
    There were but two thousand men,
    The old and the young together,
    And none unwounded returned,
    Even of these hundred score.
    Nine wounds them grievously pierced,
    There were few of them with less.
    Then raised we the noble Oscar,
    Aloft on the shafts of our spears;
    To a fair green knoll we bore him,
    That we his dress might remove.
    Of his body one hand‚Äôs breadth
    Was not whole, down from his hair,
    Till you reached the sole of his foot,
    Save his face, and that alone.
    The entrails, the liver, the spleen,
    Each draining the body till day.
    The sons of the Feinn did then
    To a fair knoll them betake;
    His own son did no man mourn,
    Nor did he mourn his brother:
    As they saw how lay my son,
    All, all did mourn for Oscar.
    Thus was it with us a while,
    Watching the fair-skinned hero,
    When we saw approach at noon
    Finn Mac Cumhail, mac Treinvor.
    From the fierce slaughter escaped,
    A third of the Feinn still lived,
    When they laid the sons of Boisgne
    Upon their biers, the fight being o‚Äôer.
    With gashed limbs the men were halt,
    The chiefs a dreadful sight.
    We saw the standard of Finn
    Raised on the shaft of a spear,
    Which from the slaughter they bore;
    Gladly to meet it we went.
    All of us saluted Finn,
    But no salute was returned,
    As he climbed the warrior‚Äôs hill,
    Where deadly-armed Oscar lay.
    When by Oscar Finn was seen,
    As o‚Äôer him sadly he bent,
    He turned to him his face,
    His grandfather saluting.
    Then did my Oscar thus speak
    To him who was first of us all:

    In death I have my desire,
    Noble Finn of pointed arms.

    Sad it is, my brave Oscar,
    Thou good son of my own son;
    After thee I‚Äôm but feeble,
    And after Erin‚Äôs brave Feinn.
    The heavy curse of Art aenir
    Is on us to our great grief,
    From the east it me pursued,
    Following me along the field.
    Farewell to battle and fame,
    Farewell to the victor‚Äôs spoils,
    Farewell to the many joys,
    Which in this body I‚Äôve had.

    When Oscar had heard Finn‚Äôs wail,
    Convulsive pangs did him seize.
    Both of his hands he stretched forth,
    And his soft fair eyelid fell.
    From us then Finn turned away,
    And shed many bitter tears.
    But for Oscar and for Bran,
    Never did he shed a tear.
    There was none but Finn and I,
    Greater than him of the Feinn.
    Then did the men give three shrieks,
    Which rung through fair Erin all.
    Five score hundred, ten hundred and ten,
    There were who belonged to us,
    Of the Feinn dead on the field,
    The number was nothing less.
    No lie it is that double,
    With Erin‚Äôs king, great tale,
    Perished on the other side,
    Of Erin‚Äôs well-armed men.
    Finn cheerful or peaceful never
    Was from that down to his death;
    Since that fight it touched him sore
    That our kings should want their land.
    Ever since Gaura‚Äôs battle
    My speech has lost all its power.
    No night or day has e‚Äôer passed
    Without a sigh for each hour.[107]
                          To-night.

[101] This is the second composition of M‚ÄôRory‚Äôs given in the Dean‚Äôs
MS. The present is as purely Irish in its incidents as the former was
Scotch, the author having been in all likelihood, as already shown, a
Scotchman, but perfectly familiar with the events of Irish history, and
equally so with what is called the Irish dialect, although in the day
of the Dean it was common to the literature of both countries, with
a few variations. It will be seen, for instance, that in several of
these pieces the Irish negative _ni_ and the Scottish _cha_, are used
indifferently. This composition has been published at much greater
length than here, under the name of Ossian, but from MSS. apparently of
no antiquity. This poem is usually called ‚ÄúCath Ghabhra,‚Äù ‚Äúthe battle
of Gaura,‚Äù or ‚ÄúB√†s Osgair,‚Äù ‚Äúthe death of Oscar.‚Äù

[102] The ‚Äúred-tree‚Äù knights were the knights of Emania, or Ulster.
C√¶sar mentions the order of _equites_, or knights, as one of the
three great leading classes into which the Gauls were divided; so
that the existence of such an order in Ireland, at an early period,
is in no way inconsistent with what history relates of ancient Celtic
policy. Cairbar was the son of Cormac, son of Art, son of Conn of the
hundred battles, Irish kings of the Emanian race. Finn, according to
O‚Äô Flaherty, was married to a daughter of Cormac, so that this battle
with Cairbar was in reality with his brother-in-law. It seems to
have originated in the Feinn, who are said to have been a species of
militia, or rather a standing army in Ireland, becoming disposed to
stretch their prerogative farther than was agreeable to the monarch,
and that the object of Cairbar in this battle was to put them down.
It is said that the Feinn were supported by the provincial king of
Munster. This is Irish history, and it is remarkable to find these
events sung by a Scottish Poet.

[103] Muckrey, or ‚ÄúThe island of Swine,‚Äù is an ancient name for
Ireland, derived obviously, not as it might be in modern times, from
the abundance of the animal in the country, where it is the sum total
of the family possessions in many instances, but from the place which
the sow held, as referred to already, in the national mythology. It is
obvious from the reference in this line to a difference with the Feinn,
that that was no new event in the history of the Irish monarchs.

[104] Another name for Ireland. O‚ÄôFlaherty says there were five names
for the island, and quotes a scholiast of the name of Fiach, who lived
a thousand years before. The names are Ere, Fodla, Banba, Fail, and
Elga. Might we not add to these the much-disputed name of Scotia,
which our Irish neighbours claim, yet don‚Äôt possess. Surely it is time
now to perceive that the only true and satisfactory solution of the
question regarding it, is that the name was applied to both countries,
latterly under the distinctive appellation of Scotia Major and Scotia
Minor, as the countries of the Scots. Surely Scotland was as much a
Scotia as Ireland, and Ireland as much as Scotland, in so far as they
were both occupied by Scottish inhabitants. This identity of race,
language, and at an early period religion, is not sufficiently allowed
for in discussing questions involving the several claims of Scotland
and Ireland to much of what was common to both. Scotland has suffered
more than Ireland from the destruction of her early archives; but is
not the life of Columba, so recently given to the world under the able
editorship of Dr. Reeves, in reality a Scottish work?

[105] ‚ÄúBanva‚Äù is another name for Ireland. This is the Gaelic name for
a _sucking-pig_, so that it also is probably mythological. It is in all
likelihood the same name with our Scottish Banff.

[106] Another name for Caoilte.

[107] It may be interesting to many readers to have here a specimen
of this poem, as taken down from the oral recitation of a Christina
Sutherland, an old woman in the county of Caithness, in the year 1856.
It commences thus:

    Is trom an nochd mo chumha fein,
    Guilgeantach mo rian,
    Smuaineachadh a chath chruaidh,
    Chuir mise ‚Äôus Cairbar claon ruadh,
    Am macsa Chormaic O Chuinn,
    Is mairg sinn a th√†radh fo ‚Äôlaimh;
    Laoch gun ghr√†in cha do chuir,
    Annsa dh‚Äô a laimh iuthaidh, etc.

Translation:--

    My mourning is grievous this night,
    Weeping is my condition,
    As I think of the fierce fight,
    Fought with red, squint-eyed Cairbre,
    That son of Cormac O Chuinn;
    Woe to them fell into his hands,
    Hero who knew no coward fear,
    Whose hand took delight in the arrow, etc.

The composition is very much the same with that of the Dean, but in
many portions contains lines which the latter wants, and in others is
comparatively defective. Although frequently superior in force, it is
not, upon the whole, so smooth and regular as the Dean‚Äôs edition. It
will be given at greater length in the Appendix to this volume.


The author of this here is Fergus the Bard.[108]


    High-minded Gaul,[109]
    Who combats Finn,
    A hero brave,
    Bold in assault,
    His bounty free,
    Fierce to destroy.
    Beloved of all,
    Gaul, gentle, brave,
    Son of great Morn;
    Hardy in war,
    His praise of old,
    A comely man,
    King, soldierly, free,
    Of no soft speech,
    No lack of sense,
    Cheerful as great:
    In battle‚Äôs day
    He moved a prince;
    Though soft his skin,
    Not soft his deed,
    Of portly mould,
    A fruitful branch,
    His heart so pure,
    He trains the young.
    ‚ÄôBove mountains high
    Rises in victory,
    We ever fear
    When he assails.
    I tell you Finn,
    Avoid the man,
    Terror of Gaul
    Should make you quail;
    Soothe him rather,
    Better than fight.
    Skilful and just,
    He rules his men,
    His bounty wide,
    A bloody man,
    First in the schools,
    Of gentle blood,
    And noble race,
    Liberal, kind,
    Untired in fight,
    No prince so wise,
    Brown are his locks,
    Marble his skin,
    Perfect his form,
    All full of grace,
    Fierce to exact,
    When aught is due,
    In vigour great,
    Of fairest face,
    No king like Gaul.
    I tell thee Finn,
    His strength as waves
    In battle‚Äôs crash,
    Princely his gait,
    Comely his form,
    Gaul‚Äôs skill‚Äôd fence
    No play when roused.
    Ready to give,
    Dreadful his strength,
    Manly his mould,
    Soldierly, great,
    Ne‚Äôer could I tell
    His grace and power;
    A fearful foe,
    Ready his hands,
    Conceal‚Äôd his wrath,
    A cheerful face.
    Like murmuring seas,
    Rushed to the fight,
    A lion bold,
    As great in deed,
    Powerful his arm,
    Choice amidst kings.
    Joyful his way,
    His teeth so white.
    ‚ÄôTis he that wounds,
    The greatest foe.
    His purpose firm,
    A victor sure,
    Desires the fight,
    In history learn‚Äôd,
    Warrior bold,
    Sharp is his sword,
    Contemptuous Gaul,
    Plunders at will.
    A fearless man,
    Wrathful he is,
    Dreadful in look,
    Leopard in fight,
    Fierce as a hound,
    Of women loved.
    A circle true
    E‚Äôer by him stood.
    He hurls his dart,
    No gentle cast.
    Soft are his cheeks,
    In blossom rich,
    Of beauteous form,
    Unchanged success;
    No stream so swift
    As his assault,
    Mac Morn more brave,
    Than any told,
    Of powerful speech,
    It far resounds,
    He‚Äôs truly great,
    Liberal, just,
    Does not despise,
    Yet firm resolves,
    Gentle, yet brisk,
    Forsakes no friend,
    In fight of kings,
    No powerless arm.
    There, fierce his mien,
    And strong his blow.
    When roused his wrath,
    He‚Äôs third of the chase.
    Noble Mac Cumhail,
    Soothe and promise,
    Give peace to Gaul,
    Check wrath and guile.

    During my day,
    Whate‚Äôer it be,
    I‚Äôd give without guile,
    A third of the chase.[110]

    Let‚Äôs hear no more,
    Soft dost thou speak,
    Finn‚Äôs love to Gaul,
    And third of the hounds.

    Gaul, leave thy wrath,
    With us have peace,
    Now without grudge,
    Thou‚Äôst of Finn‚Äôs forest third.

    That will I take,
    Fergus, dear friend,
    My wrath is gone,
    No more I ask.

    Friend without guile,
    Lips thin and red,
    Bounty and strength,
    Shall win thee praise.
                    High-minded Gaul.

[108] Fergus the Bard was one of the sons of Finn, and consequently
brother to Ossian. He was, from all we can learn, the chief Poet of
the Feinn. Ossian was both warrior and poet; Fergus was chiefly poet.
Fergus was probably somewhat like a modern Gaelic Bard, John Macdonell,
commonly called Ian Lom, who, on being urged to fight at the battle
between Montrose and Argyle at Inverlochy, replied with well-assumed
indignation, ‚ÄúCha-n e sin mo ghnothuch, cathaichibh sibhse ‚Äôus innsidh
mise,‚Äù _that is not my business,--fight you and I‚Äôll relate_. In one of
the odes preserved in the Dean‚Äôs MS., Fergus is called ‚ÄúFilidh Feinn
Eirinn,‚Äù _Bard of the Feinn of Erin_.

[109] This composition is usually called, ‚ÄúRosg Ghuill,‚Äù or the _Ode
to Gaul_. Gaul was chief of one branch of the Feinn, the branch
denominated ‚ÄúClann Moirn,‚Äù or _the children of Morn_, as Finn was
chief of the other branch, called ‚ÄúClann Baoisgne,‚Äù or _the children
of Boisgne_. The word ‚ÄúGall‚Äù means _a foreigner_; ‚Äúmuirn‚Äù means _a
body of men_, or _beauty_, _elegance_, in either sense giving a marked
significance to the name. This poem represents a difference between
Gaul and Finn, the cause of which will appear as the poem proceeds.
Fergus, as was customary with the Bards, interposes as peacemaker, and
represents to his father, whom he manifestly holds to be in the wrong,
the danger of a difference with Gaul. The ode is a very remarkable
one, having a striking resemblance to Ossian‚Äôs eulogy on Finn, as
given already in this volume. Both bear decided marks of genuineness
and antiquity. The language is peculiar, many of the words being
obsolete. Indeed, the phonetic orthography of the Dean, the peculiar
handwriting, and the discoloration and bad condition of the MS., with
the obsoleteness of many of the words, made it a matter of no little
labour to decipher the composition at all. There is an edition of it
in Miss Brooks‚Äô ‚ÄúReliques of Irish Poetry,‚Äù from which, however, the
present differs considerably in many of the lines, besides having
several additional lines, and several deficient in some parts. The
peculiar rhythm of the original, with the alliterations and vocalic
concords, give it remarkable smoothness and force. The rhythm has,
as far as possible, been retained in the translation. But besides
the language, the sentiment of the piece is strong evidence of its
antiquity. Those features of character are commended which have always
been in favour in a rude age. Bodily strength, courage, manliness, and
size, are dwelt on with all the warmth of an ardent admiration; while
as much of literary cultivation is pointed out and commended, as would
show the acquaintance of the hero with the traditions of his race. Gaul
is said to have been ‚Äúeagnaidh a stair,‚Äù _learned in history_. This and
the ode to Finn have internal evidence of being compositions belonging
to a very remote age.

[110] It would appear from this latter part of the poem, that the
difference between Finn and Gaul concerned the right to hunt. It would
appear that such a cause of controversy is no modern affair, but that
game and game-laws had their place among human interests and human
contentions from the earliest period of our country‚Äôs history. Finn
seems to have claimed the right of chase over the whole territory of
the Feinn. Gaul resisted and claimed a share for the race of Morn.
Hence the contest giving Gaul the appellation of ‚ÄúFear cogaidh Fhinn,‚Äù
or _resister of Finn_. Fergus‚Äôs intervention resulted in Gaul‚Äôs
obtaining from Finn, with good will, one-third of the territory called
here ‚Äúfiodh,‚Äù or _wooded territory_, and one-third of the hounds. There
is a curious reference to these hunting rights in one of the poems in
praise of the M‚ÄôGregors, given in an after-part of this volume, in
which it is said that Finn himself dare not hunt without leave.


The author of this is Fergus the Bard.[111]


    Tell us now, Fergus,
    Bard of Erin‚Äôs Feinn,
    How did fare the day
    In Gawra‚Äôs furious fight.

    Not good, son of Cumhail,
    The tidings from Gawra‚Äôs fight.
    Dear Oscar lives no more,
    He who bravely fought;
    Caoilte‚Äôs seven sons are gone,
    With the commons of Alvin‚Äôs Feinn.
    The youth of the Feinn have fallen,
    All in their warlike robes.
    Mac Luy too is dead,
    With six of thy father‚Äôs sons.
    Fallen are the youth of Alvin,
    Dead are the Feinn of Britain.[112]
    Lochlin‚Äôs king‚Äôs son is dead,
    Who came to give us aid,
    He of the manly heart,
    And arm at all times strong.
    Tell them now, O Bard,
    My son‚Äôs son, my delight,
    How it was that Oscar
    Hewed the helmets through.
    It would be hard to tell,
    ‚ÄôTwould be a heavy task,
    To number all that fell,
    Slain by the arms of Oscar.
    No swifter is a cataract,
    Or hawk in sweeping stoop,
    Or rapids rushing fast,
    Than in that fight was Oscar.
    You saw him, last of all,
    Like leaves in windy weather,
    Or like a noble aspen,
    When hewers strike its stem.
    When Erin‚Äôs King he saw,
    Still living ‚Äômidst the fight,
    Oscar swift approached him,
    As waves break on the strand.
    When Cairbar this observed,
    He shook his hungry spear,
    And through him drove its point.
    Chiefest of all our griefs!
    Yet Oscar did not quail,
    But made for Erin‚Äôs King;
    With force he aimed a blow,
    And smote him with his sword.
    Then Art mac Cairbar fell,
    Struck with the second blow.
    So ‚Äôtwas that Oscar perished,
    With glory, as a King.
    Fergus the bard am I,
    I‚Äôve travelled every land,
    I grieve after the Feinn,
    To have my tale to tell.
                        Tell.

[111] This is another of the compositions of Fergus, the son of Finn,
and brother of Ossian. It will be found to be an account of the death
of Oscar at the battle of Gaura. One composition on this subject by
Allan M‚ÄôRory has been given already. M‚ÄôRory‚Äôs appears to be the more
modern of the two, besides being inferior in many respects to this.
The account of Oscar‚Äôs death given here, is in the way of reply to an
inquiry of Finn.

[112] Here we have in this very ancient composition reference to the
Feinn of Britain, Britain including then as now England, Scotland, and
Wales. If the Feinn belonged to Britain as well as Ireland, they could
not have been a mere Irish militia.


This tale is by Gilliecallum M‚Äô an Olave.[113]


    I have heard a tale of old,
    A tale that should make us weep;
    ‚ÄôTis time to relate it sadly,
    Although it should fill us with grief.
    Rury‚Äôs[114] race of no soft grasp,
    Children of Connor and Connal;
    Bravely their youth did take the field,
    In Ulster‚Äôs noble province.
    None with joy returned home
    Of Banva‚Äôs proudest heroes.
    For as they once more tried the fight,
    Rury‚Äôs race did win the day.
    There came to us, fierce his mien,
    The dauntless warrior, Conlach,
    To learn of our beauteous land,
    From Dunscaich[115] to Erin.
    Connor spoke thus to his men,
    ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs prepared to meet the youth,
    And of him to take account;
    Who will take no refusal?‚Äù
    Then the strong-armed Connal went,
    Of the youth to take account;
    The end of their fight was this,
    Conlach had bound Connal.
    Yet the hero did not halt,
    Conlach, brave and vigorous,
    He bound a hundred of our men,
    It is a strange and mournful tale.
    To the hounds‚Äô great chief[116] a message
    Was sent by Ulster‚Äôs wise king,
    To sunny, fair Dundalgin,[117]
    The old, wise fort of the Gael,
    That stronghold of which we read,
    And the prudent daughter of Forgan.[118]
    From thence came he of great deeds
    To see our generous king;
    To know of Ulster‚Äôs great race,
    There came to us the red branch[119] Cu,
    His teeth like pearl, cheeks like berries.
    ‚ÄúLong,‚Äù said Connor to the Cu,
    ‚ÄúHas been thine aid in coming,
    While Connal, who loves bold steeds,
    Is bound and a hundred more.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúSad for me to be thus bound,
    Friend, who could‚Äôst soon unloose me.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt encounter his sword,
    And that he has bound brave Connal.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúRefuse not to attack him,
    Prince of the sharp, blue sword,
    Whose arm ne‚Äôer quailed in conflict,
    Think of thy patron now in bonds.‚Äù
    When Cuchullin of the thin-leaved sword
    Heard the lament of Connal,
    He moved in his arm‚Äôs great might
    To take of the youth account.
    ‚ÄúTell us now that I have come,
    Youth who fearest not the fight,
    Tell us now, and tell at once,
    Thy name, and where‚Äôs thy country?‚Äù
    ‚ÄúEre I left home I had to pledge
    That I should never that relate;
    Were I to tell to living man,
    For thy love‚Äôs sake I‚Äôd tell it thee.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúThen must thou with me battle do,
    Or tell thy tale as a friend.
    Choose for thyself, dear youth,
    But mind, to fight me is a risk.
    Let us not fight, I pray thee,
    Brave leopard, pride of Erin,
    Boldest in the battle field,
    My name I would tell unbought.‚Äù
    Then did they commence the fight,
    Nor was it the fight of women.
    The youth received a deadly wound,
    He of the vigorous arm.
    Yet did Cuchullin of battles,
    The victory on that day lose.
    His only son had fallen, slain,
    That fair, soft branch, so gentle, brave.
    ‚ÄúTell us now,‚Äù said skilful Cu,
    ‚ÄúSince thou art at our mercy,
    Thy name and race, tell us in full,
    Think not to refuse thy tale.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúConlach I, Cuchullin‚Äôs son,
    Lawful heir of great Dundalgin,
    It was I thou left‚Äôst unborn,
    When in Skiath[120] thou wast learning.
    Seven years in the east I spent,
    Gaining knowledge from my mother;
    The pass by which I have been slain
    Was all I needed still to learn.‚Äù
    Then does the great Cuchullin see[121]
    His dear son‚Äôs colour change;
    As of his generous heart he thinks,
    His memory and mind forsake him;
    His body‚Äôs excellency departs,
    His grief it was destroyed it;
    Seeing as he lay on the earth
    The rightful heir of Dundalgin;
    Where shall we find his like,
    Or how detail our grief?
                        I have.

[113] This is the composition of a Poet of whom we know nothing save
what we find in this volume. From a poem of his in praise of the
M‚ÄôGregors, he would appear to have been a Scotchman. The name signifies
Malcom, the son of the chief bard or the physician. It is found still
in the form of M‚ÄôInally. This poem is the Celtic edition of the Persian
tale of Zohrab and Rustum. The incidents are so similar, that the two
tales must have had a common origin. Whether the Persians received
the tale from the Celts, or the Celts from the Persians, or both from
some other and older source, it is hard to say. The composition is in
Gaelic, usually called, ‚ÄúB√†s Chonlaoich,‚Äù or _The death of Conlach_.

[114] Clann Rughraidh, a powerful race, who occupied the province of
Ulster at an early period, after having expelled the Clann Deaghaidh,
or the Dalcassians, afterwards of Munster.

[115] Dunscaich, a stronghold in the Isle of Skye, on the coast of
Sleat, of which the ruins still exist.

[116] Cuchullin, or the hound of Cullin, was a famous Celtic warrior,
whose fame is celebrated both in Scotland and Ireland. The name is a
curious one, and is thought by some critics to indicate the existence
of Anubis worship, or the worship of the dog, among the ancient Celts.
There is a Cullin in Skye, and another in Ireland. From which of these
the name was taken it is difficult to say. Certainly the Skye mountain
is by far the more magnificent natural object, and Dunscaich is
unquestionably in Skye.

[117] Dundalgin is said to be the modern Dundalk.

[118] Cuchullin‚Äôs wife is said to have been unwilling that he should
engage Conlach.

[119] C√π is a dog or hound. The ‚Äúred branch‚Äù heroes were the knights
of Ulster, the most famous of the Irish military orders. Cuchullin is
often called ‚ÄúC√π nan con,‚Äù or _The hound of hounds_.

[120] The Isle of Skye.

[121] The touching incident in this story is the death of the son
by the hand of his own father. It is said that Conlach‚Äôs mother, in
revenge for Cuchullin‚Äôs forsaking her, had laid her plans for securing
this object, and had sent her son into Ireland under vow never to
disclose his name until overcome in battle.


The author of this is the Blind O‚ÄôCloan.[122]


    ‚ÄôTis the sigh of a friend from Fraoch‚Äôs green mound,
    ‚ÄôTis the warrior‚Äôs sigh from his lonely bier,[123]
    ‚ÄôTis a sigh might grieve the manly heart,
    And might make a maid to weep.
    Here to the east the cairn, where lies
    Fraoch Fitheach‚Äôs son of softest locks,
    Who nobly strove to favour Mai,
    And from whom Cairn[124] Fraoch is named.
    In Cruachan east a woman weeps,
    A mournful tale ‚Äôtis she laments;
    Heavy, heavy sighs she gives
    For Fraoch mac Fithich of ancient fame.
    She ‚Äôtis, in truth, who sorely weeps,
    As Fraoch‚Äôs green mound she visits oft;
    Maid of the locks that wave so fair,
    Mai‚Äôs daughter so beloved of men.
    This night Orla‚Äôs soft-haired daughter,
    Lies side by side with Fraoch mac Fithich.
    Many were the men who loved her,
    She, of them all, loved Fraoch alone.
    Mai is filled with bitter hate,
    As the love of Fraoch she learns.
    His body got its grievous wounds,
    Because with her he‚Äôd do no wrong;
    She doomed him to a bitter death:
    Judge not of women by her deed,
    Grief ‚Äôtwas that he should fall by Mai,
    Yet I‚Äôll relate it without guile. A sigh.[125]

    A rowan tree stood in Loch Mai,
    We see its shore there to the south;
    Every quarter every month,
    It bore its fair, well-ripened fruit;
    There stood the tree alone, erect,
    Its fruit than honey sweeter far;
    That precious fruit so richly red,
    Did suffice for a man‚Äôs nine meals;
    A year it added to man‚Äôs life,--
    The tale I tell is very truth.
    Health to the wounded it could bring,
    Such virtue had its red-skinned fruit.
    One thing alone was to be feared
    By him who sought men‚Äôs ills to soothe:
    A monster[126] fierce lay at its root,
    Which they who sought its fruit must fight.
    A heavy, heavy sickness fell
    On Athach‚Äôs daughter, of liberal horn;
    Her messenger she sent for Fraoch,
    Who asked her what ‚Äôtwas ailed her now.
    Mai said her health would ne‚Äôer return,
    Unless her fair soft palm was filled
    With berries from the deep cold lake,
    Gleaned by the hand of none but Fraoch.
    ‚ÄúNe‚Äôer have I yet request refused,‚Äù
    Said Fithich‚Äôs son of ruddy hue;
    ‚ÄúWhate‚Äôer the lot of Fraoch may be,
    The berries I will pull for Mai.‚Äù
    The fair-formed Fraoch then moved away
    Down to the lake, prepared to swim.
    He found the monster in deep sleep,
    With head up-pointed to the tree. A sigh.

    Fraoch Fithich‚Äôs son of pointed arms,
    Unheard by the monster, then approached.
    He plucked a bunch of red-skinned fruit,
    And brought it to where Mai did lie.
    ‚ÄúThough what thou did‚Äôst thou hast done well,‚Äù
    Said Mai, she of form so fair,
    ‚ÄúMy purpose nought, brave man, wilt serve,
    But that from the root thou‚Äôdst tear the tree.‚Äù
    No bolder heart there was than Fraoch‚Äôs,
    Again the slimy lake he swam;
    Yet great as was his strength, he couldn‚Äôt
    Escape the death for him ordained.
    Firm by its top he seized the tree,
    And from the root did tear it up:
    With speed again he makes for land,
    But not before the beast awakes.
    Fast he pursues, and, as he swam,
    Seized in his horrid maw his arm.
    Fraoch by the jaw then grasped the brute,
    ‚ÄôTwas sad for him to want his knife:
    The maid of softest waving hair,
    In haste brought him a knife of gold.
    The monster tore his soft white skin,
    And hacked most grievously his arm.
    Then fell they, sole to sole opposed,
    Down on the southern stony strand,
    Fraoch mac Fithich, he and the beast,
    ‚ÄôTwere well that they had never fought.[127]
    Fierce was the conflict, yet ‚Äôtwas long,--
    The monster‚Äôs head at length he took.
    When the maid what happened saw,
    Upon the strand she fainting fell.
    Then from her trance when she awoke,
    In her soft hand she seized his hand:
    ‚ÄúAlthough for wild birds thou art food,
    Thy last exploit was nobly done.‚Äù
    ‚ÄôTis from that death which he met then,
    The name is given to Loch Mai;
    That name it will for ever bear,
    Men have called it so till now. A sigh.

    They bear along to Fraoch‚Äôs green mound
    The hero‚Äôs body to its grave.
    By his name they call the glen,
    Sad for those he left behind.
    Cairn Laive is the hill beside me,
    Close by it many a happy day
    The hero lived, of matchless strength,
    The bravest heart in battle‚Äôs day.
    Lovely those lips with welcomes rich,
    Which woman liked so well to kiss;
    Lovely the chief whom men obeyed,
    Lovely those cheeks like roses red,
    Than raven‚Äôs hue more dark his hair,
    Redder than hero‚Äôs blood his cheeks;
    Softer than froth of streams his skin,
    Whiter it was than whitest snow;
    His hair in curling locks fell down,
    His eye more blue than bluest ice;
    Than rowans red more red his lips,
    Whiter than blossoms were his teeth;
    Tall was his spear like any mast,
    Sweeter his voice than sounding chord;
    None could better swim than Fraoch,
    Who ever breasted running stream.
    Broader than any gate his shield,
    Joyous he swung it o‚Äôer his back;
    His arm and sword of equal length,
    In size he like a ship did look.
    Would it had been in warrior‚Äôs fight
    That Fraoch, who spared not gold, had died;
    ‚ÄôTwas sad to perish by a Beast,
    ‚ÄôTis just as sad he lives not now.
                                 ‚ÄôTis the sigh.

[122] The author of this composition is altogether unknown, nor is
it easy to decipher even the name accurately. In the original it
is distinctly ‚Äúin keich o cloan.‚Äù According to the Dean‚Äôs usual
orthography, this should be ‚ÄúAn caoch O‚ÄôCluain,‚Äù which means the _blind
O‚Äô Cloan_, or the _blind man from the green mound_. Some of the readers
of the MS. have made it out to be the name of a woman. We have given
the form of the name most likely to be accurate. The composition itself
is usually called ‚ÄúB√†s Fhraoich,‚Äù or _the death of Fraoch_.

[123] ‚ÄúCaiseal chr√≤,‚Äù usually translated _bier_, is a curious term.
‚ÄúCaiseal‚Äù means a _castle_ or _stronghold_, ‚Äúcr√≤,‚Äù a _fold_ or _pen_;
so that the word really means the _stone pen_, or _fortified pen_.
Is not this in all likelihood the stone coffin, with which we are so
familiar in ancient Celtic sepulture?

[124] It is not easy identifying the topography of this poem. It is
generally believed in Perthshire that the scene of Fraoch‚Äôs death was
in Glen Cuaich, a valley lying between those of the Tay and the Almond.
We have a Loch Fraoch there, but I have not been able to identify Carn
Fraoich, or Carn Laimh. Cruachan is spoken of as lying to the east,
which goes rather in favour of the opinion, that the scene of the poem
was in Argyleshire, Ben Cruachan being to the east of the locality
so designated in that part of the country. I cannot find any lake in
Scotland now called Loch Mai, although Loch Fraoch may have been so
called.

[125] The introduction of the ‚Äúsigh,‚Äù would seem to indicate that a
sigh was expected at certain parts of the poem from the reciter.

[126] It is needless to point out the analogy between this tale and
that of Hercules and the garden of the Hesperides. It will strike any
one acquainted with the classical story.

[127] The story is simple and intelligible. Mai loved Fraoch, and
became jealous of her own daughter, usually called Gealcheann, or
Fairhead. She accordingly planned and accomplished Fraoch‚Äôs destruction
as related.


The author of this is Connal Cearnach M‚ÄôEdirskeol.[128]


    These heads, O Connal, are worthless;
    Though thou must have blooded thine arms.
    These heads thou bear‚Äôst upon that withe,
    Can‚Äôst tell their owners, now thy spoil?

    Daughter of Orgill of the steeds,
    Youthful Evir, so sweet of speech,
    ‚ÄôTwas to avenge Cuchullin‚Äôs death,
    That I took these numerous heads.

    Whose is that hairy, black, great head,
    With cheeks than any rose more red,
    That which hangs nighest thy left arm,
    The head whose colour has not changed?

    That head the king of swift steeds own‚Äôd,
    Said Cairbar‚Äôs son of vigorous lance;
    In vengeance for my foster son,
    I took that head and bore it far.

    What head is that I see beyond,
    Covered with smooth, soft, flowing hair,
    His eye like grass, his teeth like bloom,
    His beauty such as none is like?

    Manadh, the man that own‚Äôd the steeds,
    Aoife‚Äôs son, who plunder‚Äôd every sea;
    I left his trunk ‚Äôreft of its head,
    I slew his people, every man.

    What head is that I see thee grasp,
    Great Connal of the gentle streams;
    Since that Cuchullin[129] now is dead,
    Whom to avenge him did‚Äôst thou take?

    ‚ÄôTis the head of Mac Fergus of steeds,
    He in extremity so bold,
    My sister‚Äôs son from the tall tower,
    His head I from his body wrenched.

    What fair-haired head is that to the east,
    Whose hand might well have seized the heads;
    Well did I know his voice of old,
    For he and I were friends awhile?

    Down there it was the Cu did fall,
    His body cast in fairest mould;
    Cu, son of Con, of poets‚Äô king,
    Among the last I took his head.

    What two heads are those farthest out,
    Great Connal of the sweetest voice;
    Of thy great love hide not from me
    The names of them so dark in arms?

    ‚ÄôTis Laoghar‚Äôs head and that of Cuilt,
    The two who fell pierced by my arms;
    One of them had Cuchullin struck,
    Hence his red blood my weapons dyes.

    What two heads are those to the east,
    Great Connal of the famous deeds;
    Alike the colour of their hair,
    Than hero‚Äôs blood more red their cheeks?

    Cullin the handsome, and Cunlad brave,
    Two who e‚Äôer triumphed in their wrath;
    Evir, their heads are to the east,
    I left their bodies streaming red.

    What are those six hideous heads
    I see in front facing the north;
    Blue in the face, their hair so black,
    From which thou turn‚Äôst thy look, brave Connal?

    These are six of Cuchullin‚Äôs foes,
    Calliden‚Äôs sons, who triumphed oft;
    These are now the senseless six
    Who all, full armed, fell by my hand.

    Great Connal, father to a king,
    What is that head, noblest of all;
    How bushy the golden yellow locks,
    Covering it with so much grace?

    The head of M‚ÄôFinn, M‚ÄôRoss the red,
    The son of Cruith, slain by my stroke;
    Evir, he was king, chief of them all,
    In Leinster of the spotted swords.

    Great Connal, now please change thy tale,
    Tell us the number slain by thine arm,
    Of all the noble famous men,
    In vengeance for the head of Con?

    Ten and seven score hundred men,
    I tell the truth, the number is,
    That fell by me, all back o‚Äôer back,
    Fruit of my bravery and power.

    Connal, tell how the women feel
    In Innisfail, the Cu being dead;
    Do they sadly, sorely mourn,
    Now that like me themselves have grief?

    O Evir, what am I to do,
    Now that my Cu is ta‚Äôen away;
    My foster-son of fairest form,
    Now that he‚Äôs left me desolate?

    O Connal, lay me in my grave,
    And raise my stone o‚Äôer that of Cu;
    In grief I‚Äôll soon from this depart,
    Let my lips touch Cu‚Äôs lips in death.

    Evir am I, of fairest form,
    No vengeance can me satisfy;
    In tears no pleasure I can find,
    ‚ÄôTis sad that I am left behind.[130]
                              Connal.

[128] This is the most ancient of all the Ossianic Poets. He was
contemporary of Cuchullin, who flourished, according to Irish
historians, in the first century. Cuchullin was his foster-son, and
upon his being slain, Conall took vengeance upon his enemies by putting
them all to death. In this poem he tells Evir, who was either the
wife or the betrothed of Cuchullin, the names of those thus put to
death, and whose heads he carried on a withe. The name M‚ÄôEdarscoil is
represented now by that of O‚ÄôDriscol; ‚ÄúCearnach‚Äù means _victorious_, so
that the poet‚Äôs name is really, The Victorious Conall O‚ÄôDriscoll.

[129] Cuchullin, or _The Hound of Cullin_, is often spoken of simply
as ‚ÄúAn Cu,‚Äù or _The Hound_. In the Gaelic this is either ‚ÄúCu‚Äù or
‚ÄúCon,‚Äù according as the word is in the nominative or genitive case.
In the English version it is uniformly translated Cu, as it would be
impossible to follow intelligibly the variations of the Gaelic grammar
in the cases of a proper noun.

[130] This poem is usually called ‚ÄúLaoidh nan ceann,‚Äù or _The Lay of
the Heads_. It bears many marks of genuineness and antiquity. It is
well known in the Highlands, but the Editor has never seen or heard any
reference to its authorship, except in the MS. of the Dean.


The author of this is Caoilte Mac Ronan.[131]


    I set me off to rescue Finn,
    To Taura of the joyful streams;
    With arms sure of victory,
    To Cormac, son of Art Aonir.[132]
    I will not put forth my strength,
    Though bloody and light of foot,
    Until that with the Feinn of Fail,
    We have reached the shore of Loch Foyle.
    Then did we slay the mighty hero,
    When we had slain Cuireach.[133]
    We killed a mighty warrior
    When we had killed their leader.
    We bore his head up to the hill,
    Which lies above Buadhamair.[134]
    Then indeed I had my triumph,
    For I made a total havoc.
    For the hero‚Äôs sake I slew
    A man in every town[135] in Erin.
    Then indeed I had my triumph,
    For I made a total havoc.
    For the hero‚Äôs sake I brought
    Grief into every house in Erin.
    Then indeed I had my triumph,
    For I made a total havoc.
    The calves I slew with the cows,
    Whom I found in all fair Erin.
    Then indeed I had my triumph,
    For I made a total havoc.
    The doors on which the red wind[136] blew,
    I threw them each one widely open.
    Then indeed I had my triumph,
    For I made a total havoc.
    The fields all ripe throughout the land,
    I set them then a blazing brightly.
    Then indeed I had my triumph,
    For I made a total havoc.
    In my day there won‚Äôt be seen
    Either mill or kiln in Erin.
    Then it was they loosed against me
    The horse of Albin and of Erin.
    My fleetness gave me victory,
    Until I reached Ros illirglass.
    Then I westward took my way
    To Taura, although great the distance;
    Not one horse of all the troop
    Had Taura reached so soon as I did.
    In Taura then I gave that day
    The wife of him who cared not for her.
    I gave the wife of him who cared not,
    To him who cared for his as little;
    In noble Taura then I gave
    The wife of Cairbar to Cormac.
    The wife of Cormac also gave,
    Just as I had done, to Cairbar.
    The king‚Äôs sword then I firmly seized,
    A sword of matchless power and virtue;
    My own sword, fit for little now,
    I left it in the sheath of Cormac.
    Then I passed me quickly over,
    And from the door-keeper got his garment.
    From whence it happened, it is true,
    I became candlestick to Cormac.
    Then did I many strange things do,
    In presence of the King of Erin.
    ‚ÄúThough ye may wonder at my speech,
    Caoilte‚Äôs two eyes are in my candlestick.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúSay thou not so,‚Äù said noble Finn,
    The fair-haired prince of all the Feinn;
    ‚ÄúThough I may now thy prisoner be,
    Cast not reproach upon my people,
    Such is not Caoilte‚Äôs noble nature,
    Nought he does but what is generous.
    He would not hold a servile candle
    For any gold that earth may yield.‚Äù
    Then did I draw forth his drink
    For the excellent, manly king.
    Four steps, one after the other,
    I went along with him to serve him.
    Then I betook myself to his right,
    ‚ÄôTwas one source of my sharp sorrow;
    I gave him of my own free will
    A dirge so grating, loud, and mournful.
    ‚ÄúStrange that he should give me this,‚Äù
    Said the clever, well-formed king.
    ‚ÄúThe music smells of Caoilte‚Äôs own skin,
    This mournful, unharmonious dirge.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúDo not thou say so, O King,‚Äù
    Said I, in his servant‚Äôs garb;
    ‚ÄúThese are boastful words thou speak‚Äôst.
    ‚ÄôTis worthy of one loving music.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúBy my hand, most noble Caoilte,
    As Finn has been the Feinn‚Äôs great chief,
    Though, as I am, no pledge I‚Äôll give
    To the men of Alb‚Äô or Erin.‚Äù
    As I plainly saw he knew me,
    I now did boldly ask of Cormac,
    ‚ÄúThou wilt tell me how I may
    Freedom purchase for my patron.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúThou shalt not have Finn made free,
    I say, on any one condition,
    Save this condition, noble Caoilte,
    One thou never can‚Äôst fulfil;
    That thou should‚Äôst obtain for me
    Of all wild animals a pair,
    Then to thee I‚Äôd give thy patron,
    So soon as thou such pledge redeem‚Äôst.‚Äù
    I seized upon the pleasing words
    Of Cormac Mac Airt Inir,
    That he would freedom give the king
    So soon as I fulfilled such promise.
    When I had thus by promise bound
    Erin‚Äôs noble fair-haired king,
    Though I had a trying task,
    I set off to keep th‚Äô agreement.
    From Taura I a journey took,
    A journey over all the land.
    I gathered in the flocks of birds,
    Though they were so very scattered.
    Two fierce _geilts_ I brought along,
    And two fine tall and long-clawed ospreys,
    And ravens from Fee ya von;
    Two wild ducks from Loch a Sellin,
    Two crows down from Slieve Cullin,
    Two wild oxen brought from Borrin,
    Two swans I brought from Dobhran gorm,
    Two owls from the wood of Faradrum,
    Two polecats from Coiltie creive,
    On the side of Druma Dabhran.
    Two otters also I took with them,
    From the rock of Donavan doivin,
    Two gulls from the strand of Loch Lee,
    Two _rualls_ from Port Lairge,
    Four woodpeckers from Brosna ban,
    Two plovers from Carrig dunan,

    Two wrens from Dun Aoife,
    Two _geingeachs_ from Corrie dhu,
    Two herons from Corrin Cleith,
    Two gledes from Magh a Foyle,
    Two eagles from Carrig nan clach,
    Two hawks from Ceindeach forest,
    Two sows from Loch Meilghe,
    Two water-hens from Loch Earn,
    Two moor-fowls from Monadh maith,
    Two sparrow-hawks from Dulocha,
    Two stone-chats from Magh Cullin,
    Two tomtits from Magh Fualainn,
    Two _caschans_ from Glen Gaibhle,
    Two swallows from the Old Abhla,
    Two cormorants from Dublin,
    Two wolves from Crotta cliath,
    Two blackbirds from Traigh dha bhan,
    Two roe from Luachair Ir,
    Two pigeons from Ceis Charran,
    Two nightingales from Letter Fin chul,
    Two plovers from Letter roy,
    Two starlings from Taura the green,
    Two rabbits from Sith dubh donn,
    Two wild boars from Cluaidh chur,
    Two cuckoos from Drum a daive,
    Two grey birds from Laigheande,
    Two lapwings from Lanan Furrich,
    Two woodcocks from Craobh maidh,
    Two hawks besides from Sliabh gl√©,
    Two grey mice from Limerick,
    Two otters from the Boyne,
    Two larks from Monadh m√≤r,
    Two bats from the cave of Cno,
    Two badgers from the lands of Ullanach,
    Two cornrails from Shannon valley,
    Two water-wagtails from Bruach Bire,
    Two curlews from the sea of Galway,
    Two hares from Muirtheimhne,
    Two eagles from the wood of Luaraidh,
    Two hinds from Sith Buy,
    Two _geiseadachs_ (peacocks) from Magh Mall,
    Two _cith cenceachs_ from Cnamh choille,
    Two yellow-hammers from Bruach Bru,
    Two eels from the Black Water,
    Two goldfinches from Sliabh da eun,
    Two _cathails_ from Bray an Turla,
    Two birds of prey from Magh builg,
    Two coloured swallows from Granard,
    Two fierce ospreys from Gruing,
    Two redbreasts from the Great wood,
    Two _bliorachs_ from Dun nam barc,
    Two rock cod from Cala cairge,
    Two whales from the great sea,
    Two eels from Loch M‚ÄôLennan,
    Two _gearrgarts_ from Magh nan Eilean,
    Two little birds (wrens) from Mias a chuil,
    Two fish (salmon) from Eas M‚ÄôMoirn,
    Two fine roe from Glen Smoil,
    Two cows from Achadh Maigh Moir,
    Two swift otters from Loch Con,
    Two wild cats from the cave of Cruachain,
    Two sheep from Sith Doolan gil,
    Two sows of the sows of Mac Lir;
    A ram and a red nimble sheep
    I brought with me from Ennis.
    I brought with me a horse and mare
    Of the fine stud of Mananan;
    A bull and cow in calf from Drumcan,
    These I had from Muirn Munchain.
    Ten hounds of the hounds of the Feinn
    Did Cormaig insolently require.
    Whatever thing he asked of me,
    I brought it with me as I came.
    When I had them all collected,
    And brought them to one plain,
    And sought to have them in control,
    They all of them did scatter widely.
    The raven flew away to the south,
    A cause to me of much vexation;
    I caught it in Glen da bhan,
    By the side of deep Loch Lurgan.
    The duck did also me forsake,
    Nor was it easier to take it;
    Over swift and swollen streams,
    I chased it to Achin dughlas.
    Then I seized it by the neck,
    Although it was not very willing.
    I took this duck along with me
    That I might liberate Finn from Cormaig.
    Of all the ills that I have met,
    During all my life on earth,
    Never shall my heart forget
    This, till my body is in the grave:
    With small birds, and with other birds,
    How I strove along to drive them,
    Travelling over hills and ditches,
    That with them I soon might reach him;
    While he still held Finn in bonds,
    And thought that I could never find them;
    And if I could but find him these,
    Then was he bound to give him freedom.
    This race that I had swiftly run,
    Was such as no man ran before me.
    Then I brought them all to Taura,
    To the chief who ruled the palace;
    Then had I further much to suffer,
    That night was to me very grievous.
    Within the town there was a stronghold,
    To which by nine doors there was entrance.
    Cormaig ‚Äôtwas gave me the house,
    As I now was very wearied.
    Where I saw that they were placed
    In the narrow, horrid dungeon;
    Then came a loud and vigorous scream
    From the throats of all the gathering.
    There was a little ray of light
    Reached them in through fifty openings.
    Every door was closely shut,
    Nor was the case an easy one;
    They mournfully shut closely up,
    While I as sadly was excluded.
    My heart did now pour out its grief,
    Watching by the doors till morning.
    Though great the evil I had suffered,
    As before they flew so swiftly,
    Not one I suffered to escape
    Till the day rose in the morning.
    The name men gave to this great rabble
    Was ‚ÄúCaoilte‚Äôs rabble,‚Äù and no wonder.
    To see them standing side by side,
    Was all the profit got by Cormag.
    For when Finn did get his freedom,
    All of them did scatter widely;
    No two nor three of all did go
    From Taura in the same direction.
    My own swiftness and Finn‚Äôs escape
    Was a miracle from heaven;
    The three great things to me which happened
    Were these and gathering that host.
    It is security for my fame,
    I believe in Christ, and in this,
    Though great my gathering for Finn,
    I have nought of which to boast.
    Though long my leap to the east,
    In Taura of the Fenian heroes,
    Long was my leap to the west,
    In Taura, twenty hundred feet,
    Agile then was my leap,
    Which amongst strangers I did take,
    While the point of my foot alone yielded,
    Slow is now any expedition I make.
                                I set me off.

[131] This is a remarkable composition, descriptive of an attempt of
Caoilt to deliver his friend and patron Finn from the hands of Cormac
M‚ÄôArt, King of Ireland, against whom the Feinn had been stirring up
rebellion. Caoilt, after various strange doings, is told that he can
only have Finn‚Äôs liberty on condition of bringing to Tara a pair of all
the wild animals in Ireland. A portion of the poem has been translated
in Ireland, and published in the _Dublin University Magazine_ for March
1854, in connexion with an interesting paper upon the food of the
ancient Irish, and the early zoology of their country, by Dr. Wilde.
The translation is by that eminent Irish scholar, Mr. E. O‚ÄôCurry.
In that paper the poem is said to be at least a composition of the
ninth century. It must be of extreme antiquity, as a reference to the
language of it presents an amount of difficulty owing to obsolete words
and phrases rarely met with. The Editor had the advantage of submitting
his work to the review of Mr. O‚ÄôCurry. For the topography of the poem,
which is altogether Irish, the Editor has to refer the reader to the
notes to the paper in the number of the _Dublin University Magazine_,
referred to above, which are very full and very instructive.

[132] Art, King of Ireland, was called ‚ÄúAonfhir,‚Äù or _The Solitary_,
from his love of solitude.

    Gorry, let us go to Finn,
    A service which we do not like,
    To ask of him the head of Gaul,
    That we may lay it down to rest.
    I am unwilling to go,
    Since I hear not aught of the head,
    And that we cannot have revenge,
    For the head of the great Mac Morn.
    Whether thou willest or not, I will,
    Said the great but foolish Conan;
    I will slay all the men I can
    In vengeance for the yellow-haired Gaul.
    Let us kill the three princes of the Feinn,
    As we can‚Äôt slay Finn himself.
    Speak, Gorry, speak quickly out,
    Let us be found at once on their hands.
    Thou shalt kill great Ossian M‚ÄôFinn,
    I will kill the valorous Oscar,
    Dyre shall kill the dauntless Caoilte,
    Let them have us all assault.
    I shall show no foolish softness,
    Gentleness doesn‚Äôt suit with Finn;
    Though in our arms we all should fall,
    We will have no help from Gaul;
    If Finn is there his strength will be there,
    Let us send Finn down to his grave.
    True and guileless are the words
    Which to thee I speak, Gorry.

[137] The Fenian poetry to which the Dean has attached the names of the
authors, is now all given. We proceed with those whose authors‚Äô names
are not attached to them. Many of these are manifestly of the same
period with the others, and they may with equal accuracy be attributed
to Ossian or others of the Fenian bards.


The author of this is----.[138]


    ‚ÄôTwas on a day Finn went to drink
    In Alve, with his people few;
    Six women and six men were there,
    The women fair, with whitest skin.
    Finn was there and guileless Diarmad,
    Caoilte and Ossian too, and Oscar,
    Conan the bald, slow in the field,
    With the wives of these six men;
    Maighinis the wife of dauntless Finn,
    The fair-bosomed maid, my own dear wife,
    Fair skin Gormlay, of blackest eye,
    Naoif, and the daughter of Angus.
    When drunkenness had the women seized,
    They had a talk among themselves:
    They said that throughout all the earth
    No six women were so chaste.
    Then said the maiden without guile,
    ‚ÄúThe world is a many-sided heap;
    Though pure are ye, they are not few
    Women quite as chaste as you.‚Äù
    They had been a short time thus,
    When they saw a maid approach,
    Her covering a single seamless robe,
    Of spotless white from end to end;
    The maiden of the pure white robe
    Drew near to where M‚ÄôCumhal sat.
    She blessed the king of guileless heart,
    And close beside him there sat down.
    Finn asks her to give them her tale,
    The handsome maid of whitest hand:
    ‚ÄúMaid of the seamless robe, I ask,
    What virtue‚Äôs in thy spotless veil?‚Äù
    ‚ÄúMy seamless robe has this strange power
    That women, such as are not chaste,
    Can in its folds no shelter find,--
    None but the spotless wife it shields.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúGive my wife the robe at once,‚Äù
    Said the bulky, senseless Conan,
    ‚ÄúThat we may learn what is the truth
    Of what the women just have said.‚Äù
    Then Conan‚Äôs wife does take the robe,
    And in vexation pulls it on;
    ‚ÄôTwas truly pity it was done,
    Her fair-skinned breast was all exposed.
    Then when the bald-pate Conan saw
    How that the robe shrunk into folds,
    He seized in passion his sharp spear,
    And with it did the woman slay.
    Then the loved Diarmad‚Äôs wife
    The robe from Conan‚Äôs wife did take;
    No better did she fare than she,
    About her locks it clung in folds.
    Then Oscar‚Äôs wife seized on the robe,
    Which looked so long and softly smooth;
    But wide and large as were its wings,
    The robe her middle did not reach.
    Then fair Maighinis took the robe,
    And put it also o‚Äôer her head;
    The robe there creased and folded up,
    And gathered fast about her ears.
    ‚ÄúGive my wife the robe,‚Äù said Mac Rea,
    ‚ÄúFor the result I have no fear,
    That we may see, without deceit,
    Of her merit further proof.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúI would pass my word for it,
    Though I claim not to be learned,
    That never have I once transgressed,
    I‚Äôve been faithful aye to thee.‚Äù
    Mac Rea‚Äôs wife now showed her side,
    The robe was then put o‚Äôer her head;
    Her body was covered, feet and hands,
    None of it all was left exposed.
    Her bosom then one kiss received
    From Mac O‚ÄôDuine, from Diarmad;
    The robe from her he then unfolds,
    From her who thus did stand alone.
    ‚ÄúWomen, give me now my robe,
    I am the daughter of Deirg the fierce,
    I have done nought to cause me shame,
    I only erred with sharp-armed Finn.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúBear thou my curse, and quick away,‚Äù
    These were then the words of Mac Cumhail.
    On women he denounced a curse,
    Because of her who came that day.
                            ‚ÄôTwas on a day.

       *       *       *       *       *

    The expedition of eight I remember,
    Which oft returns to my mind;
    Some of their exploits I‚Äôll relate,
    Though now my strength is all gone.
    Oscar and manly Caoilte were there,
    And Mac Luy of ceaseless praise;
    Finn and white-toothed Diarmad,
    Of the eight heroes these were five.
    There were myself and Ryno and Caroll,
    A gentle, matchless band;
    Bred were we all in Banva‚Äôs soil,
    These were the names of the eight.
    When we set forth, true the tale,
    ‚ÄôTwas with a proud and manly step.
    From Mac Cumhal‚Äôs fort we set out,
    The expedition of eight I remember.
    First of all we made for Albain,
    ‚ÄôTwas with a struggle we reached it,
    There a king fell by Mac Cumhal,
    The expedition of eight I remember.
    We then strove to get to Sasunn,[139]
    Exploits and slayings were there;
    Every stronghold was seized by Finn,
    The expedition of eight I remember.
    To Italy we then carried the battle,
    And fiercely fought in its harbours;
    Triumphs and treaties we had then,
    The expedition of eight I remember.
    In France did we then make war,
    Where we had many great hardships;
    Submission and treaties were made,
    The expedition of eight I remember.
    After that we fought in Spain,
    There we had prey and great spoil;
    I have traversed the earth in my day,
    The expedition of eight I remember.
    We next carried war to Britain,
    ‚ÄôTwas fearful and full of danger;
    Yet did we earn a triumph,
    The expedition of eight I remember.
    We bore along ‚ÄúCrom nan carn,‚Äù[140]
    O‚Äôer the fierce, stormy sea;
    Every land made to us submission,
    The expedition of eight I remember.
    After it we led the chiefs,
    Most gentle and holy Patrick,
    Who made their submission to Finn,
    The expedition of eight I remember.
    Sanctify, O Patrick, my soul,
    Thou blessed and privileged man,
    For I have sinned in thy sight,
    The expedition of eight I remember.
                                The expedition.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Nine[141] of us once did bind ourselves
    To find material for a pup‚Äôs head,
    To find material for a dog-pup‚Äôs head;
    Though no attempt was more laborious.
    We searched the plain of Leny Leirg,
    And Glen Frenich of bloody swords;
    True, we found not there one hound
    From which we could obtain a pup.
    Then did we search a dark, black glen,
    A glen of deep corries, full of stones;
    True, we found not there one hound
    From which we could obtain a pup.
    We searched the Sian of Drum Cliff,
    Fair after it seemed the plain of Liff;
    True, we found not there one hound
    From which we could obtain a pup.
    We searched in Thurles of liberal hosts,
    In Bregian Tara and Dun Dobhran;
    True, we found not there one hound
    From which we could obtain a pup.
    We searched, too, through Glen a Cuaich,
    Looking out for something noble;
    True, we found not there one hound
    From which we could obtain a pup.
    We searched Moylena of slopes,
    Through Bregian Tara and Kinsale;
    True, we found not there one hound
    From which we could obtain a pup.
    We searched the whole of Eire,
    Men and dogs ranging together;
    True, we found not there one hound
    From which we could obtain a pup.
    Shortly were we thus engaged,
    Ourselves, our followers, and friends,
    When three battalions were seen,
    Sons to the King of Rualay.[142]
    Cat-headed one battalion was,
    Dog-headed was the one beside it;
    The other behind them was white-backed,
    Brown the rest, though white the back.
    Aloft the mighty javelin shone
    Of Finn, hero of bloody strength;
    Above his noble, murderous shield,
    He bore that spear of hundred fights.
    Bright was the glitter of the spear
    In the white hand of Finn himself.
    Beneath the shield of cheerful Caoilte
    Was the javelin, bloody in fight;
    The javelin glittering below,
    Held by Caoilte of joyful heart.
    Beneath his round and handsome shield
    Cruinchan‚Äôs son his javelin bore.
    Caoilte gave a loud, far-sounding shout,
    In distant Alvin it was heard,
    And in Magh Lena of sharp spears,
    In Tavar and in Dun Reillin.
    ‚ÄôTwas answered loud by Gaul Mac Morn,
    The noble chief of Cronwoyn,
    Where Faolan, son of Finn, is found,
    The Balwas, too, from Borrin.
    ‚ÄôTwas answered by Manwoe Breck‚Äôs two sons,
    And by Mac Elle from Uabreck,
    Fair Sciath, the son of Daithein Dian,
    And Ceall the brave, of sharp-edged arms.
    Keangach the bold gave answer too,
    And Iolunn of the bloody edge,
    And Ceall the brave, of handsome form,
    Who ne‚Äôer to scandal‚Äôs tale gave ear.
    Pleasing the sound of clashing spears,
    Pleasing, too, the hum of warriors,
    Of waving banners sweet the sound,
    As in morn‚Äôs frosty wind they rose.
    The ‚ÄúImage of the Sun‚Äù[143] we raised,
    The banner of great Fenian Finn,
    Studded all around with gold,
    Great was its price as red it gleamed.
    We raised ‚ÄúFulang Duari‚Äù[144] aloft,
    The banner of great Gaul Mac Morn.
    Oft when the javelins were in motion,
    ‚ÄôTwas both the first and last to move.
    Aloft we raised the ‚ÄúMincheann Oir,‚Äù
    Banner of Ryno and his men;
    Under its folds were bones and heads
    Cloven, and ankles steeped in blood.
    The ‚ÄúCineal chath‚Äù we also raised,
    The banner of the oaken Faolan;
    Finn‚Äôs son, chief of the Feinn,
    Who cast with powerful arm his spear.
    Then we raised aloft ‚ÄúDun nimh,‚Äù
    The banner of Ossian of the brave;
    The banner of Mac Ronan, ‚Äúthe Red-hand,‚Äù[145]
    Whose other side was all adorned.
    ‚ÄúSguab Ghabhaidh,‚Äù too, we raised aloft,
    Banner of the well-armed Oscar,
    When the stormy conflict raged,
    Oft was ‚ÄúSguab Ghabhaidh‚Äù waving seen.
    The ‚ÄúLia Luinneach‚Äù aloft we raised,
    The banner of nimble, powerful Diarmaid;
    Oft when the men began their march,
    ‚ÄôTwas seen to flutter vigorously.
    Then was the ‚ÄúBearn Reubainn‚Äù raised,
    Banner of Oscar, no saintly sign;
    The echo of the glens replied
    To its fierce sounds, waving on high.
    The ‚ÄúBloody hand‚Äù aloft we raised,
    Banner of Mac Luy, and his men;
    When the Feinn went forth to fight,
    Its place was always in the van.
    Then did we fight a bloody fight,
    As round the noble Finn we stood,
    Round the steel of manly Finn,
    First of all the valorous Feinn.
    The whole of the Catheads were killed,
    The Dogheads we seized to a man;
    The whole of the Whitebacks fell
    Round dauntless Finn of Alvin.
    We found a little hill to the south,
    On which was built a double fort;
    There indeed we found a hound
    From which we could obtain a pup.
    The whole of Eire we had searched,
    All of us, both men and dogs.
    In all its length we could not find
    A hundred who could match our nine.
                                    Nine.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Sweet is man‚Äôs voice in the land of gold,
    Sweet the sounds the birds produce,
    Sweet is the murmur of the crane,
    Sweet sound the waves at Bun Datreor,
    Sweet the soft murmuring of the wind,
    Sweet sounds the cuckoo at Cas a choin.
    How soft and pleasing shines the sun,
    Sweet the blackbird sings his song;
    Sweet the eagle‚Äôs voice of Easaroy,
    Above the sea of great Mac Morn;
    Sweet the cuckoo ‚Äômongst the branches,
    Sweet the silence of the crane.
    Finn Mac Cumhail is my father,
    Who nobly leads the Feinn‚Äôs seven bands;
    When he his hounds lets loose to hunt,
    To follow him is truly sweet.
                            Sweet.

       *       *       *       *       *

    A noble tale of sweetest music,
    To Carn Vallar now I‚Äôll bring;
    That whether others hear or not,
    It may be heard by Mac Cumhail.
    Mac Cumhail once had a feast
    On Almhuin‚Äôs slope, of finest gold;
    O‚Äôer the music he presided,
    Finn who ever graced the feast.
    Brave Oscar and Diarmad were there,
    And good Mac Luy, warriors bold;
    With other two who ne‚Äôer shunned fight,
    Conan himself, and with him Oscar.
    ‚ÄúTell me now, my warriors brave,
    As at the feast of Finn ye sit,
    Which do ye count the sweetest music?‚Äù
    ‚ÄúThe clang of gaming,‚Äù Conan said,
    ‚ÄúThe sweetest sounds I ever heard.‚Äù
    Vigorous his arm before the foe,
    Yet ne‚Äôer a man who more lacked sense.
    ‚ÄúThe sound of swords drawing on the foe,‚Äù
    Said he who never spared in fight,
    ‚ÄúCleaving of men‚Äôs heads and legs,‚Äù
    The sweetest music Oscar heard.
    ‚ÄúThe sounds which ever pleased me most,‚Äù
    Said Diarmad of slow rolling eye,
    ‚ÄúThat I loved most all my life,
    Was woman‚Äôs voice, as soft she talked.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúMy music, thou son of Morn,‚Äù
    Said Mac Luy of the glittering arms,
    ‚ÄúIs leaping ‚Äômidst the tumult of my dogs,
    As swift upon the deer they gain.‚Äù
    ‚Äú‚ÄôTis this that music is for me,‚Äù
    Said Finn, the chief of all the host,
    ‚ÄúTo have my banner in the wind,
    Heroes ranged by its golden side.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúWhen of the bards I had no fear,
    Ossian,‚Äù he said, as still he spoke;
    ‚ÄúAnd when my Feinn were still around me,
    Sweet its music in my ears.‚Äù

       *       *       *       *       *

    A great feast was made by Finn,[146]
    I tell thee now, O tonsured Priest,
    Many were the men were there,
    Of the Feine of Alba and Erin.
    The great Mac Morn did ask
    Of the queen of whitest hand,
    ‚ÄúDid‚Äôst thou see so rich a feast
    Since thou cam‚Äôst ‚Äômongst the Feine of Erin?‚Äù
    Finn of the Feine himself replied,
    Chiefest of all both east and west;
    He said she saw a richer feast
    Than any Fenian feast in Erin.
    We then saw coming from the waves
    A warrior tall, manly, fair-haired,
    No man was with him but himself,
    And a noble man he was.
    When he had come near the Feine,
    Thus did he mildly, wisely say,
    ‚ÄúCome, Finn, come along with me,
    And take with thee a hundred men;
    Thirty sons of the great Morn,
    Let them be the first around thee;
    One man and eight of thy own sons,
    Take them and Oscar of the Feine‚Äôs Fians;
    Let ten of the sons of Smoil be there,
    And twenty of the sons of Ronan;
    Let some of Muin‚Äôs sons be there,
    Other ten, not counting Diarmad;
    Take with thee Diarmad O‚ÄôDuine,
    He who could either court or hunt,
    Both him and Caroll in thy ship;
    Let there be ten of men and crew,
    Of thy men take with thee nine,
    Of those whom thou‚Äôdst most like to have;
    Besides them all thyself, O Finn,
    Thou dauntless and well-armed man.
    Take o‚Äôer the waves a hundred men
    Of those that follow Finn Mac Cumhail,
    A hundred shields with golden studs,
    For Finn Mac Cumhail, Mac Tranevor.
    Take now with thee also, Finn,
    The two best hounds that are in Erin;
    Bran and Scoilean[147] take them with thee,
    The swiftest-footed of the pack.
    Have no fear about thee, Finn,‚Äù
    The tall and cheerful warrior said;
    ‚ÄúLet them all be brought in peace,
    And trouble not our men or ships.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúFoolish the speech thou now hast made,
    Thou man who cam‚Äôst amongst us;
    Wert thou to approach nearer Finn,
    Thy body soon would want its head.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúLittle care I for what thou say‚Äôst,
    Bald-headed Conan of the gibes;
    Pity for thy friends that thou art there,
    Ugly and feeble as thou art.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúRise ye up, ye sons of Boisgne,‚Äù
    Then spoke Conan, so well known;
    Each man did seize a hero‚Äôs arms,
    From every side the Fians came fast.
    Then fell there slain a son of Finn,
    One of the stalwart, white-hand Fians,
    A man of Mac Morn‚Äôs followers too,
    A vigorous hand ‚Äômidst battle‚Äôs blows.
    ‚ÄúFergus, now go rouse thee up,
    And mingle boldly in the fight;
    Ask whether Gaul has aught to give
    To Conan, whom he knows so well.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúLet Finn himself then be the judge,‚Äù
    Said the great Gaul of mighty blows;
    ‚ÄúConan or I shall take his head,
    Or else his brains we will dash out.‚Äù
    Fergus, Caol, and thirty are in the glen,
    Who never more shall see this earth,
    Unknown to all the Feine of Finn.
    Sad is my tale, O tonsured Priest.
    Much do I weary, valiant Priest,
    For now I never see the Feine,
    Hunting, as wont, from glen to glen,
    With herds of deer on every side.
    Much loved I Ossian, son of Finn,
    He only never yet forsook me;
    But above all the men I saw,
    Finn of the feasts I loved most.
                            A great feast.

       *       *       *       *       *

    ‚ÄôTis sad that the hill of the Feine,
    Should now by the clerics be held,
    And that the songs of men of books
    Should fill the halls of clan Baoisgne.
    I myself was once in Rath Cruachan,[148]
    Happily beneath thy banks,
    I little thought I e‚Äôer should find
    A priest upon thy summit dwelling.
    There would be found my shield and spear,
    My dogs and hounds along thy ridge,
    Although to-night the Fenian hill
    Is under clerics and their crosiers.
    Were the sons of Morn alive,
    The priestly order soon must quit;
    You would find yourselves cut up,
    Ye men of the spotted crooks.
    Were Mac Luy alive,
    With his six heroes bold,
    Ere you had quitted the hill
    You‚Äôd find your garments curtailed.
    Were the sons of Ceard alive,
    Who never hypocrisy knew,
    Neither your bells nor crooks
    Would in place of their banners be found.
    Were the sons of Muin alive,
    Who knew no weakness in fight,
    Men would not see thy people
    So powerful amidst our hills.
    Were the sons of black Garry alive,
    Or Caoilte, who was ever so brave,
    Neither the sounds of bells or priests
    Would now be heard in Rath Cruachan.
    Were red-haired Ryno alive,
    And brave Caol, son of Revan,
    Thy books would not be so whole,
    Oh man, who readest the Bible.
    And for all thy hooked crosiers,
    Which have travelled over the earth,
    Thy staves would be in splinters,
    Were only brave Oscar alive.
    Thou of the yellow[149] garment,
    Who sittest so much at thine ease,
    ‚ÄôTis well for thee that Conan is dead,
    Else thou‚Äôdst feel the weight of his fist.
    Were the blue-eyed hero alive,
    Bald Conan, the son of the Feine,
    Cleric, though thy office be sacred,
    With his fist he‚Äôd strike thee down.
    Were the son of O‚ÄôDuine alive,
    Thou man of the crooked staff,
    Thy staff should be all in shivers,
    Smashed at the pillar of stone.
    Thou man of the bell, I do think,
    If Daoruinn were now in life,
    Thy bell would be now in pieces,
    Scattered before the pillar.
    Were the red point seen, old man,
    Of the swift-flying spear of Mac Ronan,
    Thy bell would not be faintly sounding,
    Thou who sing‚Äôst the howling song.
    I cannot be joyful now,
    I see not Mac Cumhail in life,
    I see not Diarmad O‚ÄôDuine,
    I see not Caoilte Mac Ronan.
    No wonder though I should be sad,
    As I sit on this mound, Patrick.
    I see not the son of Luy,
    I see not the hero so loved,
    I see not Fearluth by my side,
    I see not the Fenian Oscar;
    I see not warlike exercises,
    I see not the noble hounds;
    I see not the sons of Smoil,
    I see not Gaul of great feats,
    I see not the generous Faolan,
    I see not with him the Feine.
    I see not Fergus, my brother,
    So gentle and worthy of praise;
    I see not Daire of the songs,
    Whose music we always enjoyed.
    I see not Fatha[150] Canan,
    Whose presence filled us with joy;
    I see not one of our band,
    Whose noise was like thunder in war.
    I see neither music nor joy,
    I hear not if music there be,
    Ere I was laid in my cave
    Freely I scattered my gold.
    Patrick, I tell thee it now,
    If I chose my knowledge to give,
    That ‚Äôtis not in my power to relate
    How much of their joy I have seen.
    I and the mass-book clerics,
    Are two that can never agree.
    Though this night so mournful I am,
    I‚Äôm sad for the hill of Feine.
                              ‚ÄôTis sad.

       *       *       *       *       *

    I now will tell thee, O Grainne,[151]
    What I have seen with Mac Cumhail.
    The misery I suffer now
    I cannot much longer endure.
    I have seen sport and rejoicing
    ‚ÄôMongst those who now are despised.
    I have seen maidens and men,
    I now will tell thee, O Grainne.
    Courtesy and cheerfulness too,
    I‚Äôve seen with feasts, steeds, and shouting.
    I‚Äôve seen the violin played,
    I now will tell thee, O Grainne.
    Great Caoilte and Mac Luy,
    A couple who can‚Äôt be despised,
    We oft gained nought by their wrath.
    I now will tell thee, O Grainne.
    Gaul and Oscar and Ossian,
    A brood who did nought by halves;
    These all loved us well,
    I now will tell thee, O Grainne.
    Finn himself of fearless heart,
    Whose welcome was always sure,
    We‚Äôve seen him cheerful too,
    I now will tell thee, O Grainne.
    I have in nine battles been,
    To me no joy is now left.
    Looking on nought but their graves,
    I now will tell thee, O Grainne.
    In wrath we crossed over hills,
    And over Banva‚Äôs fierce tops;
    Then in singing their praise,
    Employment was found for my lips.
    We feared for nought in the valleys,
    I now will tell thee, O Grainne.
    I was both long time and short
    Traversing Erin the fair;
    We were famous and powerful then,
    I now will tell thee, O Grainne.
                      I now will tell.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Once on a day there was in Dundalgin,[152]
    Cuchullin of the handsome form;
    Joy and merriment were his,
    All his people were with him.
    When from the drinking hall we rose,
    We saw the whole of the Feine.
    We strove from their hiding-place to raise
    The flocks of birds in the two hills.
    The most loved thing of all we had
    Was the women of Clan Rury province.
    The valley we were in was rough,
    We drove the birds to its mouth,
    In hopes that we might find a hero.
    The father of Conlach chased
    The birds with handsome Daoruing,
    The sweet-spoken noble of Coll in Galway.
    The well-formed sling was then used
    With skill by great Cuchullin,
    He with the arm of well-known strength;
    The birds with speed he kills.
    The game was then divided,
    None was forgotten but Evir.[153]
    Evir took wrath for her share,
    ‚ÄôTis true that prudence was lacking.
    ‚ÄôTwas promised her in reparation
    That she should have the first birds slain,
    Killed on the mountain side,
    With the skill of the shot for her fired.
    As they travelled they came to a place
    Where poets were wont to resort;
    Each of them wore round his neck
    A chain of the purest gold.
    The wife of Cuchullin fell in love
    With one of our Ulster Fians,
    With the willing and handsome friend
    Who came from the Ulster bounds.
    Evir of the weighty locks asks
    Her agreement with Cuchullin,
    That she should now have her birds,
    Without excuse about them.
    Twice or thrice did he shoot at
    The wild birds, but missed his aim;
    ‚ÄôTwas a victor‚Äôs leap as he shot
    Three shots amongst the birds.
    The last blow he had struck ere then
    Had pierced his own dear son.
    Without joy, or women at feasts,
    Had he been, as he sadly mourned.
    For a whole year he did nought
    But grieve for the hero now dead.
    ‚ÄôTwas not tales of the Feine he sought,
    But to have that tale rehearsed.
    If the story men tell be true,
    The Cu never ceased to grieve;
    The blossomed branch whom women loved,
    Sad and grievous was his state.
    It happened at length of a time,
    A few of the Feine met together.
    Finn himself had joined the hunt,
    And sent us in pairs to search.
    I myself sat with Garry,
    Side by side with the King.
    Finn put the question to Garry,
    As by the King‚Äôs side he sat:
    ‚ÄúSince that thou wert there,
    How was‚Äôt ye slew Cumhal?‚Äù
    ‚ÄúI will now pass my word,[154]
    Since to me the question thou putt‚Äôst,
    That mine was the powerful arm
    Which gave the first wound to Cumhal.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúThat is a cold welcome for me,
    Ye sons of Morn, as a follower;
    ‚ÄôTis hard indeed for me to bear,
    To know that ye slew my father.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúIf that be a cold welcome for you,
    Finn, son of Cumhal from Alvin,
    Put aside pretended love,
    And show your usual hatred.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúShould I now raise my arm,
    Ye hated children of Morn,
    I could do all I chose alone,
    Without the help of any man.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúEre ever thou had‚Äôst so moved,
    Walking in the steps of thy father,
    Lightly could we leap o‚Äôer streams,
    Were it not for the wiles of Cumhal.
    ‚ÄôTwas Cumhal got influence o‚Äôer us,
    ‚ÄôTwas Cumhal oppressed us sore,
    ‚ÄôTwas Cumhal that banished us far,
    To the land of the stranger away.
    Some he sent to Albin fair,
    And some to Lochlin the dark,
    The third band to Greece the white,
    We all from each other were torn.
    Sixteen years were we all
    Severed from Erin; ‚Äôtis truth,
    No small calamity was this,
    Never each other to see.
    The first day we set foot on shore
    In Erin‚Äôs isle, so much loved,
    We slew, and it is no lie,
    At least sixteen hundred men.
    These all were slain by Clan Morn,
    Their heroes and their chiefs;
    There was not a man of them all
    But such as their women would mourn.
    With that their castles we seized,
    We, the noble Clan of Morn,
    Our race did bravely then
    Before the men of Erin.
    By thy hand, hero of the Feine,
    There ne‚Äôer was seen, east or west,
    One thing to cloud my eye,
    But seeing the slaughter there;
    My heart became tender and soft
    As I saw the terrible scene.
    We all surrounded one house,
    In Munster of the red towers;
    But such was the strength of the man,
    ‚ÄôTwas easier to find than to kill.
    They slew on the opposite hill
    All that lived of Cumhal‚Äôs race.
    We made a joint and rapid rush
    To the house where Cumhal still was;
    Each man of us gave a wound
    With his spear to the body of Cumhal.
    Though it was my lot to be there
    At the time that Cumhal was slain,
    For the deed which then was done,
    Take vengeance now if you will.‚Äù
                      Once on a day.

[138] This is a curious episode in Fenian history. Maighineas was the
wife of Finn according to Irish writers on Fenian history. The daughter
of Deirg was the mother of Ossian, and consequently another of Finn‚Äôs
wives.

[139] Sasunn, ‚ÄúEngland,‚Äù after the Saxon invasion.

[140] It is difficult to say what this is. ‚ÄúCrom‚Äù was a Celtic deity.
Here the word seems to indicate a banner. The word ‚ÄúCrom nan cairge‚Äù
will be found in the second volume of the publications of the Ossianic
Society of Ireland, pp. 53, 58.

[141] This is a curious piece. The dog without doubt entered largely
into the mythology of the ancient Celts. Some have supposed that it
was an object of worship with them. Mr. O‚ÄôCurry informs the editor
that the ‚ÄúConcheannaich or Dogheads were an ancient race who inhabited
Magh O‚ÄôCoin-chinn, now Moygonihy, in Kerry. They were said to be great
enemies of Finn. This poem may really describe an attack upon them.‚Äù
One of the Irish kings was called ‚ÄúCairbar Cinn Chait,‚Äù or _Cairbar
of the Cat‚Äôs-head_. The latter portion of the poem, referring to the
banners of the Feine, has been preserved in tradition, although the
editions of it are various.

[142] This seems to have been an imaginary monarch, like many of those
in the ‚ÄúUrsgeuls,‚Äù or prose tales of the Highlands. At least the Editor
has not met with the name elsewhere.

[143] Finn‚Äôs banner had inscribed upon it, according to this bard,
‚ÄúDealbh Ghr√©ine,‚Äù or _The image of the Sun_. This word has been
corrupted by tradition to ‚ÄúDeo ghr√©ine,‚Äù said to be _the sunbeam_,
though upon no authority, ‚Äúdeo‚Äù in no case signifying ‚Äú_a beam_.‚Äù

[144] The Editor has not attempted to translate these and several
others of the emblems of the Fenian leaders. He has given the words as
he found them, except when the meaning was obvious and unquestionable.

[145] This heraldic emblem of Caoilte M‚ÄôRonan has descended through a
long course of ancestors to the modern M‚ÄôDonalds. It is probably the
oldest of the kind in the kingdom.

[146] Hospitality was the most esteemed feature in the character of
the Celtic chief. That of Finn is sung with untiring admiration by the
poets. This virtue, with bravery, generosity, and liberal giving, no
doubt to the poets themselves especially, seemed to make up what they
looked upon as a perfect character for their leader. These feasts were
apparently affairs of great moment, as the like are in our own day.

[147] Scoilean was the second favourite hound of Finn.

[148] Rath Cruachan, as Irish tradition says, was the chief seat of the
Feinn of Connaught, usually called the Sons of Morn. The word ‚ÄúRath‚Äù
means a _Fort_, and Cruachan an elevation more than usually steep. It
sometimes stands upon another hill, as in Argyleshire, where we have
‚ÄúCruachan Beinne,‚Äù _The hillock upon the mountain_, usually called Ben
Cruachan. The word ‚ÄúRath‚Äù enters largely into Scottish topography,
and assumes different forms in English, as _Rath_, _Roth_, _Rothie_,
_Rait_, _Raits_, etc.

[149] ‚ÄúYellow‚Äù was the favourite colour of the Celts. It seems that St.
Patrick adopted it as the clerical colour, very probably as a means of
commending himself and his cause to the good-will of the people.

[150] Fatha Canan appears in several of these pieces. He appears as
Fatha son of Mac Con, and Faycanan. He was son of Lughaidh Mac Con, a
King of Ireland, of the race of Ith, who flourished in the middle of
the third century. Hence his name Fatha Mac Mhic Con, _Fatha son of Mac
Con‚Äôs son_. The Irish say he settled in Scotland, and was progenitor of
the Campbells.

[151] Grainne was the wife of Finn, and the poet, whether it be Ossian
or some other of the Fenian bards, addresses this description of the
glory of Finn and his followers to her.

[152] The following piece seems to be made up of fragments. Mr.
O‚ÄôCurry, who has obligingly taken the trouble to examine it, suggests
that it contains fragments of four different pieces: The Irish bardic
account of the name of ‚ÄúSrubh Brain,‚Äù or the ‚ÄúRaven‚Äôs snout,‚Äù at Loch
Swilly; the legend of ‚ÄúCuchullin‚Äôs sick-bed;‚Äù the death of Conlaoch;
and a short but imperfect account of the battle of Cnucha, in which
Cumhal was killed. The piece is given as in the MS., and if thus
made up, is just as it was written in the beginning of the sixteenth
century. The Editor has to state, however, that the leaves which
contain it are so discoloured, and the writing so defaced, that he has
had the greatest difficulty in deciphering it at all, and for many of
the words he cannot be answerable except as guesses. Mr. M‚ÄôLachlan
of Aberdeen, who transcribed the greater portion of the MS., did not
transcribe this piece; and it is given now merely from the desire to
withhold nothing in it that may be of value or interest.

[153] Evir was the wife of Cuchullin.

[154] It is here that Garry‚Äôs account of the battle of Cnucha
commences. The account, as Mr. O‚ÄôCurry says, may be imperfect; but
the gathering together of such fragments, and comparing them with one
another, cannot but be interesting to the student of early Celtic
history. There is interest in the variety, irrespective of the question
of comparative merit as between the different compositions. This may be
a Scotch version of an Irish story.


The author of this is Duncan Mor from Lennox.[155]


    Pity the man who lost his voice,
    When he is called on to recite,
    Who cannot speak so fast as needs be,
    And yet‚Äôs unwilling to give up.
    Who cannot sing an air or tune,
    And cannot well recite a lay.
    Who cannot put aside his harp,
    Yet cannot sing as he would wish.
    Pity him ever with his ‚Äúdring, drang,‚Äù
    Trying his verses to recite,
    When men can neither hear his harp,
    Nor understand the songs he sings.
    Pity the man neglects his health,
    And strives not his vigour to retain.
    Pity the man who ever strives
    To have the fruit he cannot reach.
    Were I to wish to have such fruit,
    Fruit which I could not reach on high,
    I‚Äôd cut the tree down at the root,
    Let men be angry if they will.
                                Pity.

[155] The fragments of Ossianic or Fenian poetry in the miscellany of
Dean Macgregor are now exhausted. They afford some idea of the amount
of such poetry in the Highlands at the time he lived. We now proceed
with those pieces which profess to be of a more recent date. These
will be found to consist chiefly of compositions of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. The first short composition here given is one by
a poet hitherto unknown to modern fame. Duncan the big, from Lennox
or Dumbartonshire, might be a man of some note in his day, but time
has obliterated all knowledge of him. His composition is of a class
well known in his day, and highly popular, being aphoristic. Several
compositions, consisting of a series of aphorisms, will be found in the
sequel.


The author of this is Gilchrist Taylor.[156]


    Bless, O Trinity, thy household,
    King of heaven, place of jewels;
    Black thy family was not formed,
    All by thyself in wisdom made.
    By thee ‚Äôtwas Adam‚Äôs race was shaped
    The cheek like berries richly red;
    Thou who blessest place and people
    Curse them that ‚Äôgainst thee fierce contend.
    There is a pack of cruel hounds,
    Who the king‚Äôs children sorely grieve;
    I hear the baying of these dogs,
    Every glen is full of it.
    Such as war on Adam‚Äôs race,
    Since that they cannot silence keep,
    Joined together in their evil,
    Powers of the king of light them smite;
    Such as war on Adam‚Äôs race,
    Of crafty Lucifer the slaves,
    Give them no rest, to them give none,
    King of lights do thou them burn.
    Mounted on two ugly steeds,
    When vicious packs abound the most,
    They furiously commence the hunt,
    Belching out death on every side.
    Curse thou their hunt and devastation,
    Their two steeds so black in hue;
    Lay them, their backs stretched on the turf,
    Scatter the heads of this black band.
    There is a band of cruel hounds
    Harbouring at Inch Ald Art,
    They‚Äôre horrid brutes, Thou God forsake them,
    Let bags out of their skins be made.
    Though many be the skins of wolves,
    Covering our harps, both small and great,
    The cold and empty skulls are many,
    Given us by these fierce hounds.
    Father of Christ, with speed them strike
    From Lochaber to Raon Fraoich,
    Soon let the plague their bodies waste;
    ‚ÄôTis sad that thus I have to speak.
    Though no reparation for a true hound,
    For Robert‚Äôs son[157] of clustering locks.
    From Loch Venachar of rich glens,
    Many‚Äôs the ugly head laid low.
    Though from Ben Gulbin‚Äôs sunny side,
    Many the dogs to Tummel‚Äôs stream,
    Who know to hunt along its side,
    The eye of Christ is on them all.
    ‚ÄôTwas told me when at Inverness,
    That greyhounds were scattering the pack.
    Pity the man who‚Äôs seized with fear,
    ‚ÄôTis like the falling sickness, sore.
    Pleasing to witness hounds pursue,
    Them who would slay the fine grey steeds.
    May God‚Äôs Son with His holy power,
    Destroy all surly cruel hounds.
    Smoke every den in Schiehallion,
    John Stewart of the bounding steeds,
    Ere I must call a sweet-voiced pack
    This litter of ugly, snarling curs.
    By Garry of John Stewart of the white steed,
    No antlers are seen without the head,
    While ‚Äômongst the rocky rugged woods,
    Are seen the grey-skinned pack of hounds.
                                      Bless.

[156] There are several pieces by this poet in the Dean‚Äôs MS., but we
know nothing of his history. He was probably an ecclesiastic.

[157] The piece is extremely obscure, but the reference to Mac Robert
and the Athole Stewarts would seem to indicate that the subjects of the
poem were the murderers of King James the First. The infamous persons
whom the poet denounces are said to have done evil to the race of
kings.


The author of this is Gilliecallum Mac an Olla.[158]


    There is no joy without the clan Donald,
    No battle when they are awanting;
    First of the clans in all the earth,
    Each man of them is a hundred.
    The noblest clan which you can find,
    A race as brave as they are peaceful;
    The clan whose praise does fill the lands,
    Famed for their faith and godliness.
    The clan so faithful, bold, and brave,
    The clan so swift amidst the fight,
    The clan so gentle among men,
    And yet in battle none so fierce;
    The clan most numerous of all
    Whose number has been ever known.
    The clan which never vexed the Church,
    And ever dreaded its reproach.
    Of all that dwell in Albin green,
    This is the bravest e‚Äôer baptized.
    The third of every land is theirs,
    Their bravery is like the falcon‚Äôs.
    The clan most numerous and famous,
    Of finest form and fairest mould;
    The clan that has the largest hearts,
    Most patient and most liberal.
    They, sons of kings, deserved no gibe
    When asked in trouble to give help.
    Noble were they since the time
    When there was giving and poor ones.
    The clan for wine and shelter best,
    The first in prowess and in strength.
    ‚ÄôTis sad how short the length extends
    Given by him who spins your thread.
    They were not wicked and rough,
    Nor were they gentle and weak.
    In midst of trial and hardships,
    Not harder than them was the rock.
    The clan without pride or misdeeds,
    When the spoil of battle is theirs.
    ‚ÄôMongst them you‚Äôd find gentlemen,
    And common people with them.
    Pity him who has lost their defence,
    Pity him who forsakes their protection.
    There is no clan like the clan Donald,
    The noble clan of firmest mind.
    Who is there can number their gifts?
    Who is there can count their nobles?
    Without limit, commencement or close,
    Of excellencies among their gentry.
    First of all with the clan Donald,
    There is knowledge which they learn;
    Last of all, there is among them
    Polish, generosity, and modesty.
    ‚ÄôTis in sorrow and in grief
    Understanding and learning are got,
    By him who them would have.
    No joy without the clan Donald.
    Loud was the sound of their thunder,
    This race so wise and faithful,
    Though now they be reproached,
    There is no joy without the clan Donald.
    This people so great in fame,
    In courtesy, mind, and firmness,
    There is no right without them,
    There is no joy without the clan Donald.
    The son of his virgin mother,
    Who hath earned for us freedom from pain,
    Though he be faithful and true,
    There is no joy without the clan Donald.
                                  There is no joy.

    Alas! alas! this is the head[159]
    Which belonged to the blue-armed Conull;
    The head where understanding was found,
    Noble it was and most lovely.
    Alas! alas! this is the eye
    That dwelt in generous Conull‚Äôs head;
    Round which the eyelid wound,
    Benevolent it was and manful.
    Alas! alas! this is the mouth
    In which no bard did folly find;
    Its lips so thin, like apples red,
    Sweet as honey the mouth of Conull.
    Alas! alas! this is the hand
    That Conull Mac Scanlan owned;
    The hand of him so brave in battle,
    The hand of Conull my first beloved.
    Alas! alas! this is the side
    By which our noble side we laid;
    It was a hound from Mull that came,
    John did lie upon his side.
    Alas! alas! this is the foot
    Which ne‚Äôer before a warrior fled;
    The foot of him in fight most brave,
    The foot of the shielded son of Scanlan.
    Alas! success e‚Äôer followed Conull,
    Where‚Äôer it was he battle fought;
    But now that my tale is done,
    This place is the dwelling of tears.
                                    Alas!

[158] This bard has been met with already as an imitator of Ossian.
He was in all likelihood an ecclesiastic. Several of the early Lords
of the Isles were liberal benefactors to the Church, and it is not
unlikely that this liberality called forth the praises of our bard.
The word ‚Äúbochd,‚Äù _poor_, associated in one of the lines of this
composition with ‚Äúbrontachd,‚Äù _bestowing_, is often by early Gaelic
writers applied to monks and hermits, who lived upon the beneficence of
the wealthy, and became finally enriched by their gifts.

[159] Mr. O‚ÄôCurry says regarding this Conull Mac Scanlan, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know
any person in our history whose name would agree with his but Congal
Claen, son of Scanlan, Prince of Ulster, who fought the battle of Magh
Rath in A.D. 634, in which the Four Masters say he was killed. The old
account says he was disabled, and disappeared no one knows where. It
would be curious if your elegy could be traced up to this hero.‚Äù


The author of this is John of Knoydart.[160]


    Thou head of Diarmad O‚ÄôCairbre,[161]
    Though great be thy trouble and pain,
    I grudge thee not all thou hast suffered,
    Although it be painful to tell.
    I grudge not though thy ragged locks
    Be searched by the winds from the glens.
    I grudge thee not that thou art bound,
    Thou head of Diarmad O‚ÄôCairbre;
    Pity the thought e‚Äôer filled men‚Äôs breasts,
    That thy friendship was not hatred;
    Pity, alas! thou turn‚Äôdst not back,
    Thou head of Diarmad O‚ÄôCairbre;
    Thou hast the King of Isla slain,
    Who freely gave his wine and money,
    Him of the soft and flowing locks,
    Thou head of Diarmad O‚ÄôCairbre;
    Isla, king of well filled horns,
    Who with his friends so kindly dealt;
    Alas! who gashed his soft white skin,
    Thou head of Diarmad O‚ÄôCairbre!
    Beloved was that liberal hand,
    Which never grudged his gold or silver,
    And which in feast or hunt was first,
    Thou head of Diarmad O‚ÄôCairbre.
    It is my prayer to th‚Äô Apostles‚Äô King,
    He who preserves by His great power,
    That He from pain may him e‚Äôer keep,
    Thou head of Diarmad O‚ÄôCairbre.
                          Thou head.

[160] Of the author of this fragment we have no tradition. All we learn
here is that he was a Knoydart man, that mountainous region lying
between Loch Hourn and Morar, on the west coast of Inverness-shire,
till lately possessed by the Macdonells of Glengarry.

[161] In a transcript of a MS. history of the Macdonalds, published
in the Transactions of the Iona Club, it is said that Angus Og of
Isla, or of the Isles, who fought against his father in the battle
of the Bloody Bay, was assassinated by Art O‚ÄôCarby, an Irish harper,
instigated by M‚ÄôKenzie, whose daughter had captivated the impressible
musician. In the Irish annals this harper is called Diarmad. This lay
seems to commemorate the event by commemorating the punishment of the
assassin, which was inflicted by drawing him between horses. The lines
being composed shortly after the event, which took place about the year
1490, and being taken down by the Dean, are sufficient evidence of the
historical accuracy of the statement.


The author of this is Gormlay, daughter of Flann.[162]


    Melancholy earth upon the breast of Nial,
    Melancholy its depth upon his grave;
    Neither nobility nor fame can save,
    Since that the King of the North is dead.
    Whose back is turned upon this joyful world,
    Now that his death-wound he received.
    He from the noble race of Nial is traced,
    The men who proudly governed all this land.
    I, the gentle, kind, Mac Cuilenan,[163] did leave,
    With Muireagan m√≤r I also joyful lived.
    With Nial I spent a truly happy life;
    Bright was my honour as with him I drunk,
    Of feasts and wine I could abundance have;
    My gold I freely gave the church.
    If any there be who heaven reach,
    How could Nial be without heaven?
    Never have I seen one like Nial.
    Fair was he all except the knee,
    Great were his beauty and his fame,
    Soft were his locks, and grey his eye.
    Wrath grew upon the mighty deep,
    The wind in strength blew from the east,[164]
    Nial then bent him on his knee,
    Stronger it blew and without fail;
    It suffered no happiness nor peace.
    The wind never ceased its sound,
    Neither fort nor tree was spared,
    Since that the courteous king is dead.
    Since Nial[165] Aidh‚Äôs son died yesterday,
    Numbers on numbers sorely mourn;
    And though cups and horns are filled,
    Sore is the blow to Conn‚Äôs great race.
    Without him prosperity is joyless,
    His form my heart with sorrow fills,
    That I‚Äôm till judgment left behind,
    Is that which fills my heart with grief.
                                  Melancholy.

[162] Gormlay was the wife of Nial Glundubh, _Nial of the Black Knee_,
who succeeded to the throne of Ireland in 916. He was of the northern
O‚ÄôNeills, hence called ‚ÄúRigh Tuaisgearta,‚Äù or _King of the North_.

[163] The famous Cormac M‚ÄôCuilenan, the King-bishop of Munster and
Cashel, to whom M‚ÄôGeoghagan says Gormlay was first married.

[164] Nial Glundubh was killed in battle by the Danes in 919, having
reigned only three years.

[165] Nial was son of Aidh Finliath, King of Ireland. O‚ÄôFlaherty
mentions an elegy of Gormlay on her husband, as preserved in the Annals
of Donegal.


Gormlay, daughter of Flann.[166]


    Monk, remove thy foot,
    Lift it off the grave of Nial.
    Too long dost thou heap the earth
    On him with whom I fain would lie;
    Too long dost thou, Monk, there
    Heap the earth on noble Nial.
    Thou brown-haired friend, though gentle,
    Press not with thy sole the earth.
    Do not firmly close the grave,
    O Priest, whose office is so sad.
    Raise off the fair, black-kneed Nial,
    Monk, remove thy foot.
    Mac O‚ÄôNial of finest gold,
    ‚ÄôTis not of my will thou‚Äôrt bound.[167]
    Leave his stone and his grave,
    Monk, remove thy foot.
    I am Gormlay, who order keeps,
    Daughter I of Flann the bold;
    Stand not thou upon his grave,
    Monk, remove thy foot.
                      Monk.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Wounded thou hast been, great man,[168]
    Whate‚Äôer the men were thou hast met;
    Though thou art truly sad and sick,
    ‚ÄôTis joy to us that thou‚Äôst got fame.
    Ten hundred ships from Greece of the Gael,
    While of them only three were noble,
    Thou didst attack with sharp-edged arms,
    Sore was the strife while life did last;
    That people with their many spears;
    They live not now who were so pure,
    Thy six nobles at last they slew,
    Many their bold deeds at thy side.
    That of thy wounds thou may‚Äôst be healed,
    I pray for thee, pray thou thyself,
    To Mary, the mother of the poor,
    My Pater and my Creed‚Äôs for thee.
                              Wounded.

[166] This is another elegy of Gormlay, Queen of Ireland, on her
husband, Nial Glundubh. There is something extremely mournful in these
compositions of the youthful queen. Mr. O‚ÄôCurry has kindly furnished
the Editor with Irish copies of these two elegiac pieces, which he is
about to publish in a second volume of his admirable Lectures.

[167] Referring, undoubtedly, to the mode of laying out the dead.

[168] The allusion in this fragment is not very clear. Celtic poetry is
full of reference to Greece, whence a portion of the race are said to
have come; but what this battle with Greeks was, the Editor cannot say.
These allusions belong, without doubt, to the period when both Scotland
and Ireland were brought into contact with Greek literature.

    Not good for a man to want a friend;
    Not good is a poet without a subject;
    Not good is a tower without a hall;
    Not good is a web without fulling;
    Not good is sport without laughter;
    Not good are misdeeds when prosperous;
    Not good is marriage without consent;
    Not good is a crown without supremacy;
    Not good is ploughing by night;
    Not good is learning without courtesy;
    Not good is religion without knowledge.
                                    Not good.

       *       *       *       *       *

    I myself, Robert, went[170]
    Yesterday to a monastery,
    And I was not allowed in,
    Because my wife was not with me.

       *       *       *       *       *

    I dislike to journey for a year;[171]
    I dislike the table where a woman sits;
    I dislike sorrow and sadness;
    I dislike a great house without joy;
    I dislike seeing a good man with a bad wife;
    I dislike a frown upon a prince‚Äôs face;
    I dislike weak drink at a high price;
    I dislike a noble without courtesy;
    I dislike war when it is peace,
    When nothing is allowed to pass;
    I dislike a rough and cruel chief;
    I dislike the men who cannot fight;
    I dislike being long at a tune;
    I dislike the men who grudge me food;
    I dislike a jealous woman if unchaste;
    I dislike the dog who cannot kill a stag;
    I‚Äôm loath to go to Erin in the west,
    Now that Brian of the tunes is dead;
    I dislike a widow who is not cheerful;
    I dislike the man of melancholy mind;
    I dislike an ill-favoured old woman,
    Whose tongue is sharp and rapid too;
    I cannot tell to any man
    All the things that I dislike.
                                  I dislike.

[169] We have here a curious specimen of aphoristic poetry, the idea
borrowed probably from the Proverbs of Solomon. These aphorisms throw
some light upon the habits and modes of thought of the age in which
they were produced.

[170] These lines are given as indicative of the state of public
feeling at the time with respect to a great social question. The writer
of these lines was manifestly no friend to monasteries, and no believer
in their purity.

[171] We have here another specimen of aphoristic poetry. In the
original the lines are in rhyme. The author‚Äôs name is not given, though
it is probably Phelim M‚ÄôDougall.


Earl Gerald.[172]


    Pity the man who overleaps his horse;
    Let him that likes, my meaning understand,
    That from myself my means have taken flight;
    ‚ÄôTis best to have nought to do with women.
    May my curse ‚Äômongst women rest,
    Although for a time I mixed with them;
    As for men who still are single,
    ‚ÄôTis best to have nought to do with women.
    That man who early is on foot,
    Cannot but many evils find;
    Were I to tell what I have seen,
    ‚ÄôTis best to have nought to do with women.
    The man who has got a useless wife,
    Cannot do much before the foe,
    The first milch cows that bellow loud;
    ‚ÄôTis best to have nought to do with women.
    The wife who listens to my speech,
    Who listens to my voice and cry,
    Just as if wax were in her ears;
    ‚ÄôTis best to have nought to do with women.
    Her husband she to wrath provokes,
    Different her manner with all else,
    For them she lightly steps about;
    ‚ÄôTis best to have nought to do with women.
    Were she to see a weeping eye,
    With any youth of handsome form,
    To him she would not run but leap;
    ‚ÄôTis best to have nought to do with women.
    Where is the young and sprightly maid,
    Who would not quietly give her kiss,
    To any lips that she might meet?
    ‚ÄôTis best to have nought to do with women.
    Though married from th‚Äô altar and the church,
    From the good priest‚Äôs worthy hand,
    Still are her way and temper bad;
    ‚ÄôTis best to have nought to do with women.
    ‚ÄôTis best to have nought to do with women,
    Wrath and annoyance they provoke;
    He who does not this proclaim
    Is sure to find a woe himself.
                              Pity.

[172] The following is the composition of Gerald Fitzgerald, the fourth
Earl of Desmond. He is known in Ireland as Earl Gerald, the poet. There
are several of his compositions scattered over the MS.; but as they
are mostly of the same character--satires on the female sex--it has
been thought that one specimen is sufficient. The Editor thought it
desirable to give one of those, with a view to a fair representation of
the contents of the MS., although there is not much in the composition
itself to render it worthy of being rescued from oblivion.


The author of this is Andrew M‚ÄôIntosh.


    The coquetry of Duncan from Taid‚Äôs daughter,
    The most impudent coquetry men have seen,
    The coquetry of the wife of David,
    Coquetting like the wind in her red-tailed skirts,
    Men had thought that I was dumb,
    Whilst I‚Äôd three reasons not to speak.


The author of this is the Bard M‚ÄôIntyre.[173]


    What is this ship on Loch Inch,[174]
    Of which we now may speak?
    What brought this ship on the loch,
    Which songs cannot o‚Äôerlook?
    I would like much to ask,
    Who was it brought that ship,
    Afloat upon that angry loch,
    Where changes often come?
    The fierce wind from the hills,
    And bitter storms from the glens,
    Oft has the vessel from the shore,
    Stolen upon the dangerous sea.
    Stranger, who sawest the ship,
    On the rough and angry stream,
    What should hinder thee to tell
    About her and about her crew?
    An old ship without iron or stern,
    Never have we seen her like,
    The vessel all with leather patched,
    Not even beneath the waves is‚Äôt tight.
    Her boards are trifling bits of deals,
    Black patches down along her sides,
    Useless nails to fix them on
    Upon her scanty, stinted ribs.
    What woman cargo is in the black ship
    Pulling her on betwixt the waves,
    The cargo heartless and senseless too?
    Widows of a foolish mind,
    A boasting, talkative crew,
    A load vexatious and bad,
    Quarrelsome and covetous,
    Of evil minds and evil deeds.
    Their ways and conversation bad,
    A band of well-known fame,
    No substance in what they say,
    Drunken, singing, with levity,
    A band ill-shapen, mischievous,
    Who live by both sides of Loch Inch.
    In spite of thee and of their ship
    On the stormy sea‚Äôs dun face,
    No good woman could take that ship,
    However pressing the constraint.
    The worst of women go to sea,
    Others cannot give them help.
    Let this ship be driven from the loch,
    Down to the fierce and roaring deep,
    Let the wind pursue the ship,
    To the old point of Seananach.
    There will I leave upon the stream,
    The ill-favoured, ill-doing ship,
    Of wicked widows full on the sea,
    Without a psalm or creed e‚Äôer said,
                                      What.

       *       *       *       *       *

    The fame of the house of Dunolly, little favour where they drive
          a herd.[175]
    This brute is much like a dog, greedy aye for stolen flesh.

[173] Nothing is known of this poet. The modern M‚ÄôIntyre, the bard of
Glenurchy, has a place second to none among the composers of Gaelic
poetry; but it would appear that there was an older poet of the name,
and one not unknown to fame. Four hundred years may produce no little
change in the place which not a few men of note in our day hold in the
temple of fame, and greater stars than the bard M‚ÄôIntyre may have their
lustre dimmed by time. He is another writer of satires on women, a kind
of composition wonderfully popular, judging from our MS. at the period.
We only give a few specimens of these, but there are several in the
miscellany, and some of a character which, in modern days, one wonders
the Dean could have admitted to his collection.

[174] The only loch of this name with which the Editor is acquainted is
Loch Inch, on the Spey, in Badenoch.

[175] These satirical lines on the family of Dunolly are given as a
specimen of the strain indulged in at times by the bards, to gratify
their animosity against hostile clans. It need hardly be added, that
the Macdougalls of Lorn were a race as distinguished for the antiquity
of their descent, as for the high character of many of the name.


The author of this is John M‚ÄôMurrich.[176]


    Sad to me‚Äôs my fate,
    Though men don‚Äôt understand,
    Suffer not, Son of God,
    Me to have pain to-day.
    Little thought the school
    That such should be my fate,
    The fate which me o‚Äôertook,
    ‚ÄôTis it has me destroyed.
    The pain in it I have,
    Is threefold what I‚Äôve felt,
    The trouble I have found
    Is weighted with a stone.
    For her who caused my grief,
    My wrath and rage are great.
    Her skin like froth of waves,
    Ruddy and soft her hand,
    Her lips like berries red,
    My soul she gently seized.
    Since I slept last night,
    Sad indeed my state.
    I thought she was beside me,
    That I saw her smile.
    She‚Äôs not been since the day,
    When began my grief.
    She of curling locks,
    And colour richly red,
    Five jewels in a knot,
    In the maiden‚Äôs name.
    Pity she‚Äôs not with me,
    And others have her not.
    That I myself might get
    For evermore that friend.
    Were I to suffer from,
    What other men have felt,
    The spear of great Cuchullin,
    The horse of white-steed Teague,
    The purple shield unbroken,
    Famous all in war;
    The speed of Mac Erc‚Äôs coursers,
    Though much it is to say,
    Alas, more sad for me
    The trouble I endure.

[176] This John M‚ÄôMuirich, or M‚ÄôVurrich, was in all likelihood a
member of the family who were so long bards to Clanranald, and who
derived their name from their great ancestor in the thirteenth century,
Muireach Albanach. A list of the names of these bards is given for
eight generations by Lachlan, who lived in 1800, in his declaration, as
given in the Report of the Highland Society on Ossian, but it does not
embrace this John. The piece is chiefly interesting from the historical
references at the close.


Duncan M‚ÄôPherson.[177]

    Alexander, hast thou left thy sadness,
    Or is it so that thou canst not?
    Hast thou without God passed another year,
    Or dost thou mean to live thus ever?
    Hast thou not found thy God,
    Now that thou‚Äôrt aged and grey?
    If sadness be prosperity,
    Rich are the gifts thou‚Äôst got from God.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Four men met at the grave,[178]
    The grave of Alexander the great;
    They spoke the words of truth,
    Over the hero of Greece the fair.
    The first man of them said,
    ‚ÄúThere were yesterday with the king,
    The world‚Äôs great hosts, sad the tale,
    Though to-day he lonely lies.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúYesterday the world‚Äôs great king
    Proudly rode upon the earth;
    But to-day it is the earth
    That rides upon the top of him.‚Äù
    Then did the third wise speaker say,
    ‚ÄúYesterday Philip‚Äôs son owned the world;
    But to-day he only owns
    Of it all not seven feet.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúAlexander, brave and great,
    Who won and treasured gold and silver,
    To-day,‚Äù the fourth man wisely said,
    ‚ÄúThe gold it is that treasures him.‚Äù
    The palm among trees was Philip‚Äôs son,
    The moon among the lesser stars,
    As gold above the finest gems,
    As among fish leviathan.
    The lion amidst carrion,
    The eagle among other birds,
    As Sion hill amidst the hills,
    As Jordan amidst other streams.
    The polished gem ‚Äômongst common stones,
    The sea amidst all lesser streams,
    Noble was the fearless man,
    The man above all other men.
    The man above all other men,
    Save heaven‚Äôs great and holy King.
    King he was of herds and boars,
    Ruler of hosts and heroes too.
    True was the talk these speakers had,
    As at the great king‚Äôs grave they met.
    Unlike to women‚Äôs empty talk,
    Were the sayings of the four.
                            Four.

[177] This writer was probably an ecclesiastic, but nothing is known of
him.

[178] This composition is one of the few of the more recent fragments
in this MS. which appear elsewhere. We have a copy of it in the
collection of Gaelic poems made by Ronald M‚ÄôDonald, schoolmaster of
Eigg, son of Alexander M‚ÄôDonald, the famous Skye bard. M‚ÄôDonald‚Äôs
edition was most likely taken down from oral recitation, and it is
remarkable how little it differs from this of the Dean‚Äôs, 250 years
before.


John M‚ÄôMurrich said this.


    The men of Albin, and not they alone,
    Unless that M‚ÄôGregor survived,
    How much wrath would them destroy!
    All excellence in Alexander.[179]

[179] Alexander was a family name of the Macgregors of Glenstrae. In
the obituary contained in this MS. is the following entry:--1526.
Obitus Gregorii filii Johannis M‚ÄôGregor, alias M‚ÄôEvine M‚ÄôAllester de
Glenschray. This would indicate the period of Alexander as about the
middle of the fifteenth century.


Finlay, the red-haired bard, said this.[180]


    Gael-like is every leap of the dun horse,
    A Gael she is in truth.
    It is she who conquers and wins,
    In all that I‚Äôll now sing.
    The praise of speed to her limbs,
    In every fierce assault.
    Marked, and famous her strength,
    While quiet at the house of prayer.
    The birds are they who could,
    Strive with her in the race.
    Not false is the fame of that horse,
    The steed both sturdy and swift,
    Liker she was to Duseivlin,[181]
    Than to the beast of Lamacha.[182]
    They who would view her size and triumphs,
    Can nowhere find her match.
    Just like the wheeling of the mountain winds,
    Is the action of the prancing steed.
    Hundreds admire her paces,
    Like one in frenzy passing.
    Like the point of an arrow this horse,
    Famous are all her doings.
    Bands of the great witness her course,
    As with speed she rushes.
    Though far before her stands the groom,
    No blunderer is her rider.
    Few are the words would tell her praise,
    Like birds on wing her movements.
    Her triumphs and paces the same,
    Whether ‚Äômong rocks or bogs she moves.
    Before that horse all men do fear,
    When she comes in the trappings of war.
    In the troop, the hunt, or the conflict,
    That horse a noble horse is.
    That horse is all full of spirit,
    As fameworthy she follows the banner.
    That wave-like steed, hardy and keen,
    Will win for her rider the praise of men.
    Forth from her stall she takes the lead,
    That gentle, great, and active horse.
    She will triumph in speed and slaughter,
    Till that the day in evening sinks.
    Ready to treasure the girdle of gold,[183]
    The field with violence shakes.
    Startling, rounded, bright, well shod,
    Gentle, broad-backed, coloured well.
    A horse of such great fame as this,
    I long had heard that they possessed.
    Where was ever found her match,
    Not he, the beast of Lamacha.
    Mac Gregor ‚Äôs the master of that horse,
    Prince of the house to poets free.
    From Banva men do come to praise,
    To Albion they do come to seek,
    The man who robs from the Saxon,
    And e‚Äôer puts his trust in the Gael.

[180] This Finlay is the author of several pieces in this miscellany.
He is apparently the Finlay M‚ÄôNab to whom another composition is
attributed, and is called in one place ‚ÄúAm bard maith,‚Äù _The good
poet_. He seems to have been the family bard of M‚ÄôGregor, the praise of
whose horse he here proclaims in most poetic strains.

[181] Duseivlin was one of the famous steeds of the Feinn.

[182] The beast of Lamacha, ‚ÄúAidhre an Lamacha,‚Äù is entirely unknown to
the Editor. The animal is called ‚ÄúBeisd,‚Äù _a beast_, in a subsequent
part of the poem. It must have been some animal famous in the country
for its ugliness.

[183] The girdle of gold would seem to have been the prize conferred
upon the victor in a race.


Finlay the red-haired bard.


    I am a stranger long to success,
    ‚ÄôTis time that I should have it.
    ‚ÄôTis time now to desist,
    From satire justly due.
    The way that I shall take,
    To seek a noble branch,
    Is to the Prince of the Gael,
    Where are no worthless guests.
    To Mac Gregor the brave,
    Head of all the schools;[184]
    He‚Äôs neither cruel nor sparing,
    To praise him is our duty.
    To whom courage is a right;
    When summer time comes round,
    Peace he never knows,
    He‚Äôs in the throat of all his fellows.
    When men of him do speak,
    As Gregor of the blows,
    ‚ÄôTis his delight to drive,
    Flocks and herds before him.
    Of that flock John‚Äôs[185] the head,
    The king at lifting cattle,
    I myself will sing,
    Mouth with mouth at daybreak.
    When his sharp-armed men see,
    Mac Gregor at the Bealach,[186]
    His way so gently soft,
    No weight to them their burdens.
    Then when war arises,
    Proclaimed in enemies‚Äô hearts,
    It is to him they‚Äôd gather,
    Clothed in martial dress.
    ‚ÄôTis of Mac Gregor‚Äôs fame,
    When fighting‚Äôs left behind.
    To men not to be cruel,
    His castle full of mirth;
    When victory I had left
    Upon the field of war,
    When of the fight I spoke,
    Nought loved my patron more.
    Though sad, on the stormy lake,
    To tell men of my grief,
    To have a crew of mariners,
    Is best in battle‚Äôs day.
    Remember I‚Äôll be with thee,
    Mac Gregor without stain,
    In face of any foe,
    Long, long‚Äôs the time.
    Gentle Elizabeth,
    Change thou my state;
    Woman of softest locks,
    And of the loftiest brow.
                          I am.

[184] The schools of the bards. Many Highland bards at this period were
trained in Ireland, of which these poems bear evident marks.

[185] In his obituary the Dean enters at 1519, May 24-26, death of John
dubh MacGregor of Glenstrae, at Stronmelochane. He was buried in Dysart
(Glenurchy), north of the great altar, in a stone coffin, upon the 26th
of May 1519, on which day there was a great mourning in Glenurchy. The
Elizabeth afterwards mentioned was probably the wife of this chief.

[186] ‚ÄúBealach,‚Äù the modern ‚ÄúTaymouth,‚Äù was, with the territory around,
in possession of the M‚ÄôGregors down to about 1490, when it passed by
Royal charter into the possession of the Knights of Glenurchy.


The author of this is Duncan Mac Cailein, the good knight.[187]


    Who is now chief of the beggars,
    Since the famous man is dead?
    Tears flow fast for the man,
    For beggary has lost its strength.
    The orphan is in a piteous case,
    Beggary‚Äôs gone since Lachlan‚Äôs death.
    In every homestead this is sad,
    That beggary should want for knowledge.
    If he be dead, I‚Äôve never heard,
    Of one that could compare with Lachlan,
    Since God created man at first;
    It is a source of bitter grief,
    That without mother or a father,
    Poor beggary should be so weak.
    Since that Bretin‚Äôs son is dead,
    Why should I not mourn his loss?
    There is no man now on earth
    Who can beg as he could do.
    Since Lachlan the importunate‚Äôs dead,
    Great‚Äôs the grief that is in Erin.
    Who will now beg a little purse?
    Who will even beg a needle?
    Who will beg a worthless coin?
    Since that rough-palmed Lachlan‚Äôs dead.
    Who will beg a pair of brogues,
    And then will beg a pair of buckles?
    Who will beg a shoulder plaid?
    Whose begging now will give us sport?
    Who will beg soles for his shoes?
    Who will ask a peacock‚Äôs feather?
    Who will beg an eye for his belt?
    Who will mix in any mischief?
    Who will beg an old felt hat?
    Who will beg a book to read?
    Who will beg an early meal?
    Who is it wears arms with his dress?
    Who will beg for boots and spurs?
    Who is it will beg for bristles?
    Who will beg for sids and meal?
    Who will beg a sheaf of rye?
    Who will ask a sporran spoon?
    Who will gather without shame?
    Since Lachlan the hero is dead.
    Who will now afford us sport?
    Who will beg for maidens‚Äô shifts,
    Since old shoe‚Äôd Lachlan is dead?
    Sad the fate that he should die,
    Who will ask men for a rullion?
    Who will steal the servant‚Äôs feather,
    And who is it can‚Äôt tell the truth?
    Who likes to travel in a boat,
    And likes his old friends to visit?
    Who will beg the hen with her eggs?
    Who will beg a brood of chickens?
    Who will ask the hen‚Äôs overplus,
    After a handful of money?
    Who will beg a headless pin?
    Who can read as he can do?
    That Lachlan should leave no heir,
    Is that which mournful makes his death.
    Who will beg for a hook and line?
    Who will seek for open doors?
    Who will beg for unboiled rennet?
    Who will beg for anything?
    Who won‚Äôt give a penny to the poor,
    And yet e‚Äôen from the naked begs?
    Who would oppress the very child,
    And is cruel to the infant?
    Who would beg for wool and butter,
    That they may have it, after Lachlan?
    Who would beg a woman‚Äôs collar?
    Who is it likes a dirty heap?
    Who would beg from young women,
    From little dogs and weasels?
    Who would take the fire from an infant?
    Who would steal e‚Äôen the dead?
    Who is sick when he is well?
    Who on his gruel begs for butter?
    More sad for me than this man‚Äôs death,
    Is that he has left no heir.
    For fear that beggary should die,
    And none be found to keep it up.
    Do not ye forget the man,
    Men of the earth, do ye,
    Each of you for himself make rhymes,
    My malison on him that won‚Äôt.
    If Lachlan died on Monday last,
    Every man will joyful be.
    Sad it is that for his death,
    None there is who will lament.
                       Who is now.

[187] This poet is generally supposed, by those who have seen the
Dean‚Äôs MS., to have been Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenurchy, one of the
most distinguished of the ancestors of the present noble family of
Breadalbane. There are several pieces in the MS. attributed to him.
These are remarkable for caustic humour, indulged in in several cases
at the expense of the female sex. He almost uniformly receives the
title of ‚ÄúAn Ridir maith,‚Äù _The good Knight_. The present piece is a
strange satirical elegy on a miser.


Gormlay, daughter of Flann, the good wife.


    Alas! alas! my own great pain,
    Alas! that I‚Äôve my beauty lost,
    To-night sore is my wound,
    Since that Mac O‚ÄôNeill is dead.
    Alas! to want the son of Dervail,
    Alas! my fate now left behind,
    Guaire‚Äôs hospitality is nought,
    Erin‚Äôs a desert without him.
    Alas! for the good king of Banva,
    How fair thy form down to this night,
    Since he, my life, in battle died,
    Nought will I say but alas! alas!
                                  Alas!


The author of this is Duncan M‚ÄôCabe.[188]


    M‚ÄôDougall of bright armour,
    A noble chief‚Äôs thy famous son,
    All that I think is true
    Of thy fair-formed, prudent child.
    ‚ÄôT were better that thy fair head
    Were now exposed than mine, kind friend.
    Duncan Carrach[189] is his name,
    A name that triumphed ever.
    Duncan of bravest deeds,
    Remember thy first honoured name;
    Son of Allan,[190] do not merit,
    Reproach thy race did ne‚Äôer deserve.
    Since now that thou art so well known,
    With every reason to esteem thee,
    To thee is given the foremost place,
    Since thou the favourite art of all.
    True it is thou art indeed
    The man to take the richest spoil.
    Like a bull that‚Äôs fierce for fight,
    ‚ÄôTis thus thou goest to make war.
    ‚ÄôTis thou who traversest Cruachan,[191]
    Casting thy spear beneath its knolls.
    Thy fame is as that of the leopard,
    Thou art Duncan of Durinis.
    Thou quellest quick thy foe,
    Thou stainest both hands with blood.
    Thou cheerest us when we are weary,
    Thou art the source of all our joy.
    He is the man whom ‚Äôtis easiest
    In song like mine to praise,
    Which among heroes I compose,--
    The generous dragon of Connal.[192]
    Other fame belongs to him,
    The art that is in his gun.
    The bravery and skill of Erin
    Bound firmly up in all his blows.
    Whatever skill a king‚Äôs son has,
    That he has, with no defect.
    The purest speech has come to him,
    This will in thy son be found.
    Now I see thee raise the tax,
    Truly out of every homestead,
    Noble king of bravest deeds,
    Descendant of that martial race.
                         Macdougall.

[188] We know nothing of this poet. The name is a rare one, although
still existing in the Highlands. He would appear to have been a family
bard of the Macdougalls of Dunolly.

[189] In the Dean‚Äôs chronicle of deaths, contained in this MS., is
the following entry in Latin:--1512, Jul. 13. The death of Duncan
M‚ÄôDougall, who was slain A.D. 1512, who was the son and heir of
Alexander M‚ÄôDougall of Dunolly; and Duncan was buried in Ardchattan
13th July. ‚ÄúCarrach‚Äù means a _scald head_, from which he seems to have
got his name in childhood. The poet refers to his head as now more
smooth than his own.

[190] In Innes‚Äô Orig. Par. vol. ii. part 1, p. 115, it is said, on the
authority of the Acts of Council, that, in 1478, Colin Earl of Ergile
was sued by Alane Sorlesone M‚ÄôCowle for warrandice of the lands of
Lereage and Wouchtrouch, etc. This is probably the Alan referred to by
the bard.

[191] ‚ÄúBen Cruachan,‚Äù the highest mountain in Lorn, the ancient
territory of the clan Dougall.

[192] Connal Ferry, the remarkable narrow at the mouth of Loch Etive,
where the stream at times becomes a salt-water cascade. The name
‚ÄúConnal,‚Äù ‚ÄúConthuil,‚Äù means a _roaring stream_.


The author of this is John M‚ÄôEwen M‚ÄôEacharn.[193]


    A mournful cry amongst Conn‚Äôs[194] race,
    Heavy indeed is now their loss;
    As every one now follows John,
    Silent they can‚Äôt be at his grave.
    What grief did ever them o‚Äôertake,
    The race of Conn ne‚Äôer honour lost.
    For John each man does weep,
    Necessity leads us to his grave;
    Sad is the land because of thy death,
    Son of the noble race from Allan.
    Great is our grief as thee we mourn,
    Few are the men that shed not tears.
    Sorely has it touched us all,
    Grievous the tale that John is dead.
    Tidings from the Dun went through the land,
    The stranger now does o‚Äôer us rule.
    Changeful the world down till John‚Äôs death,
    Now they rise not to the fray;
    Since then indeed thy race is sad,
    This grief now has them sorely wounded.
    ‚ÄôTis grief to them that thou art thus,
    Clan Dougall mourn for their great chief;
    The conflict of their grief is long,
    The tale which now is told is grievous;
    Thou messenger who brought the news,
    God made thee messenger of evil;
    Ere men thy tidings did recite,
    Pity they had not lost their ears.
    The abundance of my racking grief
    Has almost my eyesight ta‚Äôen away;
    No feeble mourning is‚Äôt for John,
    Tears for him I cannot shed;
    Mourning for our buried prince,
    The death of Macdougall of Dunolly.
    His was the form of Conn‚Äôs great race,
    Like a nut kernel, fair and rounded;
    His death has been a grievous breach,
    The very waves sing his lament.
    Above the beach,[195] since John has died,
    No ceasing is there of men‚Äôs sorrow;
    Men speak not even now of joy,
    Since that this grief has on them seized;
    Bitter sorrow has them filled,
    No word of sport, of music none;
    That way is called the sacred way,
    That from the beach leads to the grave.
    So do men thus mourn their loss,
    And women too, who loved thee well.
    Shall I from thy soft locks have honour?
    In place of it I have but ruin.
    I mourn as on thy grave I stand,
    All I see makes me lament;
    Women will not leave thy grave,
    So truly heavy is their sorrow.
    Raise up a tomb for our fair prince,
    Let it be wide as Cruachan‚Äôs cell,
    That men may see by what they do,
    How heavily on them weighs their grief.
    The clan with weeping do thee mourn,
    Their soul is sad, they cannot sleep.
    Dougall‚Äôs race before thy death,
    Never did fear the face of foe.
    Chieftain, thy death has come on them,
    ‚ÄôTwould be no boast to rule them now.
    Not few the women at John‚Äôs grave,
    Pouring their tears from day to day;
    Of women bands even by night,
    With bare heads gathering on the plain;
    No wonder is‚Äôt that they should mourn,
    Because of John of brightest fame.
    No day can pass but hearts are full
    Of this sad tale, that wakes our mourning.
    I care not though‚Äôt be thus with them,
    Though they should feel what I don‚Äôt like;
    Thy death for us is ill to bear,
    Sore the state to which it brings us;
    I stand amidst the gloom of death,
    No word is there of wonted song;
    My heart is truly rent in twain,
    As we speak of his departure;
    Never were we thus before,
    That it is grief to ask, how fares he;
    ‚ÄôTis cause of sorrow that he is absent,
    I mourn that he is no more with us;
    Now that he sleeps in his cold grave,
    ‚ÄôTis melancholy what men feel to tell;
    They cannot cease from shedding tears,
    Castle and cottage both in sorrow;
    The rising tide has swept o‚Äôer hills,
    So for John do mourn his comrades;
    Yet there‚Äôs no heaving of the sea,
    Not of the boisterous sea at Connal;[196]
    For thou art mourned, great chief of Conn,
    In all the borders of clan Dougall;
    The land for thee does seem to weep,
    Loud is the cry, with much distress,
    From the musicians of Dougall‚Äôs race,
    The learned men, and leading bards.
    On John‚Äôs grave lies a heavy stone,
    ‚ÄôTis grief to me to tell the story;
    Far otherwise than Neil[197] would wish,
    Does every scandal now appear;
    Have they no care to see his grave,
    Since that John has overcome them?
    The race of Conn are now but few,
    Since death has ta‚Äôen away Macdougall;
    No pleasure in the violin‚Äôs sounds,
    Nor writing poetry without him;
    Poetry brings no honour now,
    Since death has seized the son of Mary;
    Few are the mouths that now can tell,
    How commanding is her privilege,
    Now that on their backs are laid,
    Both the heads of the clan Dougall;
    That John‚Äôs great power I do not find
    Soon after losing John his father;
    May God preserve thy noble nature,
    Who wisdom learned from thy Isla[198] teacher;
    Horses can‚Äôt insure a triumph,
    Men must leave them, and depart;
    After the three, our loss is great,
    My heart, in truth, can find no comfort;
    Mournful in youth to see such loss,
    Death has seized two Johns and Alexander;[199]
    Alexander, whom no restraint could bind,
    That I of him should also tell;
    Thy breast was stout to the rushing wave,
    Thy body now! alas my sorrow;
    Never do ye seek again
    That John‚Äôs young heir should go to battle;
    That he should stand ‚Äômidst battle‚Äôs storm,
    Lest soon he come to his long grave.

[193] We have no written or traditional account of this poet. He
was manifestly one of the bards of the clan Dougall. The difficulty
of deciphering the Dean‚Äôs writing is in this case increased by the
peculiar measure of the composition, which is one of those well known
to Irish scholars, and where the accentuation is in accordance with the
Irish mode. The Editor does not pretend to have deciphered every line
with perfect accuracy, but he is pretty well assured of having caught
the meaning of the poet throughout.

[194] The clan Dougall, as well as the cognate clan Donald, were held
by the bards to have descended from ‚ÄúConn Ceud chatha,‚Äù _Conn of the
hundred battles_, King of Ireland.

[195] The Macdougalls of Dunolly buried at the old Priory of
Ardchattan, on the banks of Loch Etive.

[196] Connal Ferry, on Loch Etive.

[197] There is considerable obscurity about these lines. It would serve
to elucidate the meaning if we knew of any feud between this chief and
the clan Neil, or any person of the name of Neil belonging to any other
Highland clan. The Editor has not been able to find any information on
this subject.

[198] The original here is indistinct. The word ‚Äúnoid illeich,‚Äù made
‚Äúan oide Ilich,‚Äù may be ‚Äúnord Illeich,‚Äù or ‚Äúan uird Ilich,‚Äù _The Isla
order_, meaning some ecclesiastical order in Isla, by whom he was
educated, or it may refer to the weapons of war for which Isla was
famous.

[199] Alexander was Laird of Dunolly in 1493; Greg. High. p. 83. His
son Duncan Carrach was slain young; Dean‚Äôs Obit. Greg. Ed. In Innes‚Äô
Orig. Par. vol. ii. pt. i. p. 114, we find that, in 1451, Stewart Lord
of Lorn granted to John M‚ÄôAlan of Lorn, called M‚ÄôCowle, and to John
Keir (‚Äúciar,‚Äù _dark_), his eldest son and heir, etc., twenty-nine
marklands of the island of Caruvray, etc. These are probably the two
Johns and Alexander of our bard. This holding of the Stewarts may
explain the bard‚Äôs reference to the rule of the stranger.

    The sluggard‚Äôs Book of Poems,[200]
    If ‚Äôt were your wish to write in it,
    Among what they have left you‚Äôll find
    Enough wherewith to fill it.
    Though many the men there be,
    Who cruelly the people oppress,
    Never will these be found,
    Honoured in famous songs.
    Of all the fruits of sluggards,
    Though there be of them a thousand,
    The house in which these do meet,
    They ne‚Äôer can by any means reach.
    They are both gentle and simple,
    Dressed in their Sunday coats;
    And yet of all their productions,
    It happens we never can hear.
    I won‚Äôt their genealogy tell,
    Of their history nothing I know,
    But that they are out at evening,
    Followed close by their hounds.
    Dugall, thou art their fellow,
    John‚Äôs son of the polished blade,
    In whom flows the sluggard‚Äôs blood,
    Write thou in the Book of Poems.
    Write knowingly, intelligently,
    Write their history and their life;
    Don‚Äôt bring a poem on the earth,
    To have it read by Mac Cailein.
    Remember this my claim on thee,
    Gregor, as thou hast heard
    That I have as an obligation,
    All thine to put in the Book of Poems.
    Let there be nothing in this poem
    Of priests or of tenantry;
    But nothing of this band there is,
    Which is not in the Book of Poems.
                                The sluggard‚Äôs.

[200] The word ‚Äúduanaire,‚Äù here used in the original, means ‚Äúa
miscellany of poetical compositions.‚Äù The Dean‚Äôs MS. is a ‚Äúduanaire,‚Äù
but not a ‚Äúduanaire nan strangair,‚Äù for the Dean seems to have been a
most industrious compiler. This piece of M‚ÄôNab‚Äôs is a satire on lazy
composers or compilers. It is valuable as showing that the ancient
bards wrote their compositions. The number of such books must have
been large, although during the course of centuries they seem to have
perished with few exceptions.

    Jewel,[202] who has roused my grief,
    Beloved hast thou been of me,
    Beloved that joyous, generous heart,
    Which thou hadst until this night.
    Thy death has filled me with grief,
    The hand round which I lived so long,
    That I hear not of its strength,
    And that I saw it not depart;
    That joyful mouth of softest sounds,
    Well was it known in every land.
    Lion of Mull, with its white towers,
    Hawk of Isla, with its smooth plains,
    Shrewdest of all the men we knew,
    Whom guest ne‚Äôer left without a gift.
    Prince of good men, gentle, kind,
    Whose mien was that of a king‚Äôs son,
    Guests came to thee from Dunanoir,[203]
    Guests from the Boyne[204] for lordly gifts.
    Truth it is they often came,
    Not oftener than gave thee joy.
    Shapely falcon of Sliabh Gael,[205]
    Protection to the bards thou gav‚Äôst,
    Dragon of Lewis of sandy slopes,
    Glad as the whisper of a stream;
    The loss of but a single man
    Has left me lonely, now he‚Äôs gone.
    No sport, no pleasing song,
    No joy, nor pleasure in the feast;
    No man whom I can now love,
    Of Nial‚Äôs race down from Nial √≤g;[206]
    Among our women there‚Äôs no joy,
    Our men no pleasure have in sport,
    Just like the winds when it is calm,
    So without music is Dun Sween.[207]
    See the palace of a generous race,
    Vengeance is taken on clan Neil,
    The cause of many a boastful song,
    And will till they lay us in the grave;
    And now ‚Äôtis hard to bear, alas!
    That we should lose on every side.
    Didst thou, son of Adam, crush
    Any cluster of three nuts,
    It is to him thou lovest most
    The largest third of them thou‚Äôdst give.
    Thus of their husk the topmost nut,
    Does to clan Neil, ungrudged, belong.
    The bountiful have often poured
    Their gifts on the dwelling of clan Neil.
    The prince, who was the last of all,
    Is he who me with gloom has filled.
    In half my purpose I have failed,
    Jewel, who has roused my grief.
    Broken my heart is in my breast,
    And so ‚Äôt will be until I die;
    Left by that black and noble eyelid,
    Jewel, who hast roused my grief.
    Mary, mother, foster-mother of the king,
    Protect thou me from every shaft;
    And thou, her Son, who all things mad‚Äôst.
    Jewel, who hast roused my grief.
                              Jewel.

[201] This poetess seems to have been the wife of the last M‚ÄôNeil of
Castle Sween. The name M‚ÄôCorqudale is common in Kintyre.

[202] The word ‚Äúpaidrein,‚Äù derived from ‚ÄúPaidir,‚Äù _The Lord‚Äôs Prayer_,
really means _a rosary_.

[203] Dunanoir was a castle on the island of Cape Clear, on the
south-west coast of Ireland. See _Miscell. of Celt. Soc._ p. 143.

[204] The river Boyne. From Dunanoir to the Boyne included all Ireland.

[205] Sliabh Ghaidheael, a range of hills in Kintyre.

[206] In Innes‚Äô Orig. Par. vol. ii. pt. i. p. 41, we find that Hector
M‚ÄôTorquil Mac Neil was constable of Castle Sween in 1472. In 1481 the
office and lands were conferred on Colin Earl of Argyle. Between these
two periods M‚ÄôNeil would appear to have died, leaving no heir in the
direct line.

[207] Castle Sween is an ancient stronghold at the mouth of Loch Sween
in Knapdale, said to take its name from Sween of Argyle, who flourished
in the thirteenth century; but the Irish annalists make mention of it
at a much earlier period. It was probably a stronghold of the Dalriadic
monarchs.

    Bold as a prince is John[209] in each gathering,

    Though brave Gael may be the foe,

    No wonder though bards should fill thy court;
    To his white breast there is no match,

    Three fair watches him surround,
    Never as captives were his men;
    His arm in battle‚Äôs struggle strong,
    Well did he love to hunt the deer.
    In mien and manners he was like
    The king who ruled amongst the Feinn.
    Mac Gregor of the spoils, his fortune such
    That choicest men do covet it.
    Good and gentle is his blue eye,
    He‚Äôs like Mac Cumhail of liberal horn,
    Like when giving us his gold,
    Like when bestowing gifts on bards,
    Like in wooing or in hunt,
    To the Cu Caird[213] among the Feinn.
    Fortune attends the race of kings,
    Their fame and wisdom both are great,
    Their bounty, prudence, charity,
    Are knit to them, the race of kings,
    Wine and wax and honey,
    These, with the stag-hunt, their delight.
    Famous the actions of John‚Äôs clan,
    Like to the sons of the Fenian king;
    John himself was like to Finn,
    First and chief ‚Äômongst all his men.
    Though many sought to have Finn‚Äôs power,
    ‚ÄôMongst those who fought against the Feinn,
    On Patrick‚Äôs son fortune attends,
    His enemies he has overcome.
    Mac Gregor who destroys is he,
    Bountiful friend of Church and bards.
    Of handsome form, of women loved,
    He of Glenstray of generous men.
    Easy ‚Äôtis to speak of John,
    His praise to raise loud in the song,
    Giving his horses and his gold,
    Just as a king should freely give.
    King of Heaven, Mary virgin,
    Keep me as I should be kept;
    To the great city fearless me bring
    Where dwells the Father of the king.

[208] This poet was probably a M‚ÄôGregor.

[209] In the Dean‚Äôs Obits, as already quoted, we find that, in 1519,
died John Dow M‚ÄôPatrick M‚ÄôGregor of Glenstray, at Stronmelochan. He was
apparently the subject of this laudatory ode. He is called grandson
of Malcolm. Accordingly, we find among the Dean‚Äôs Obits, that Malcolm
M‚ÄôGregor, son and heir to John M‚ÄôGregor of Glenstray, died in 1498.

[210] The original is ‚Äúsliochd an row,‚Äù or ‚Äúan rudha.‚Äù It is translated
as if the word were ‚Äúr√¨ghe,‚Äù _kings_; but the Editor is in doubt if
this be the word meant.

[211] The M‚ÄôGregor‚Äôs glens were Glenurchay, Glendochart, and Glenlyon.

[212] ‚ÄúBrainean,‚Äù the word here translated _prince_, is the ancient
Gaelic form of the Welsh ‚ÄúBrenhin,‚Äù _a king_. The word is now obsolete
in the Highlands.

[213] ‚ÄúCu ceaird,‚Äù _The artificer‚Äôs dog_, is an old name for Cuchullin.
It is said in Ireland to have originated in Cuchullin having killed the
watch-dog of Cullin, artificer to King Cormac; whereupon he undertook
to watch himself, and hence obtained the name of Cullin‚Äôs dog, or
Cuchullin, also ‚ÄúCu ceaird.‚Äù

[214] This is a curious fragment, and is of interest from the
references in it to the Highland clans. The writer, who towards the
close gives his name as Maoldomhnaich, _Servus Domini_, was apparently
the illegitimate son of some man of note, and was in all likelihood a
Maclean.

[215] There is, between Tobermory and Aros in Mull, a place marked in
the maps Arile. This was probably the residence of our bard.

    Long do I feel my lying here,
    My health to me is a stranger;
    Fain would I pay my health‚Äôs full price,
    Were mine the numerous spoils.
    A spoil of white-haired, heavy cows,
    A spoil of cows for drink or feasting,
    I‚Äôd give besides the heavy bull,
    If for my cure I had the price.
    The herds and flocks of Mannanan,[217]
    The sword and horn of Mac Cumhail,
    The trumpet of Manallan[218] I‚Äôd give,
    And the quiver of Cuchullin,
    Ir, Evir, and Eireamon,[219]
    And were I to possess them,
    The harp of Curcheoil,[220] which hid men‚Äôs grief,
    The shield of the King of Golnor.[221]
    Lomond‚Äôs[222] ship of greatest fame,
    Had I it upon the strand,
    All I‚Äôve seen I‚Äôd freely give,
    Ere as now I‚Äôd long remain.
    Long to me appears the coming
    Of Alexander Mac Intosh,
    That my disease he might drive away,
    And thus I might no longer lie.
                                Long.

[216] The Editor has not been able to identify the author of this
poetical complaint. During the existence of baronies, with their
bailies or local judges, the number of barons or baron bailies in the
Highlands must have been large. Of this class was most likely our poet.

[217] An ancient Celtic hero, from whom the Isle of Man takes its name,
as well as the district in Scotland called Slamannan.

[218] The Editor has not been able to obtain any account of this
person. There is a contraction over the second _a_ in the MS., which
makes the reading doubtful.

[219] The three sons of Milidh of Spain, from whom the Milesian races
are descended, according to Celtic story.

[220] The Editor can give no account of these names. The traditions
respecting them seem to have perished.

    For the race of Gael, from the land of Greece
    There is no place where they can rest;
    Doubtless thou would‚Äôst much prefer
    To raise the Gaelic race on high.
    Now that thou risest ‚Äôgainst the Saxon,
    Let not thy rising be a soft one;
    Have your swords with sharpened blades,
    Let your spears stand by your sides,
    Let us not forsake our country,
    Let us fiercely, bravely fight.
    It is said by the Gael of Banva,[224]
    Our fathers did the tale repeat,
    And I have heard there was a time,
    Long ago, that Innis Aingin[225]
    Was ruled by the Fomorian[226] race,
    Who raised from it a heavy tax.
    Thus for a while the Saxons have
    Our country burdened heavily;
    And now each clan is full of fear,
    And we are plunged in grievous doubt.
    But now that a gathering‚Äôs begun,
    There‚Äôs need that chiefs should rouse them up;
    For with them, ‚Äôtis my opinion,
    We will share a common fate.
    Who is the man, whom we can tell,
    Will from the Saxon save the Gael?
    Who in our day has won much fame,
    And whose house is truly noble?
    Know a man, were he but willing,
    Of whom we readily might tell,
    His power in Banva widely known,
    Men all bound with him to gather.
    Archibald of the pointed head,
    Of thee it is that men now speak.
    Earl of Argyle,[227] I thee beseech,
    Be as a hero in the conflict;
    A hero who shall reign supreme
    O‚Äôer Gael from the famous land;
    Noble, high-born prince of the Gael,
    Thou‚Äôlt in apportioned Albin reign.
    Hero, who‚Äôll desert no fight,
    With sword, so long as right remains,
    Who for the Gael from Greece, subjection
    Ne‚Äôer suffer would at Saxon‚Äôs hand.
    The very roots from whence they grow,
    Pluck them that thou may‚Äôst us deliver;
    Suffer not a Saxon hence to live,
    After that thou overcom‚Äôst them.
    Burn all their women, ugly in form;
    Burn their children, every one;
    Burn their black huts, burn them all;
    And crush their enmity to us.
    Drown their warriors in their streams,
    When their accoutrements are burnt.
    Cease not, while a Saxon lives,
    To drown them weakened in their streams.
    Remember thou, of ruddy cheeks,
    The claims we on the Saxon have;
    Oppression and beggary all thy days,
    When that their oppression throve.
    Remember thy own father Colin;[228]
    Remember Archibald,[229] father to him;
    Remember Duncan,[230] the prosperous,
    He who was liberal and friendly;
    Remember thou that other Colin;[231]
    Remember Archibald[232] as well;
    Remember Colin[233] first of all,
    He who was brave amongst the Gael.
    Remember that they never gave
    Their tax from terror of the Saxon;
    Much more it now belongs to thee
    To see that thou bear‚Äôst not this tax.
    Now that there is but thy sire‚Äôs blood,
    Of Gael from the famous land,
    Let the men together come,
    Let them fill with fear their foes.
    Let them attack the Saxon now,
    Wake thee up then, son of Colin,
    Golden-haired one, war is begun,
    ‚ÄôTis not good to sleep too much.
                                Great.

[223] There is a portion of the beginning of this ode wanting, and we
have no means of knowing who the poet was. A reference to the history
of the time, and the names introduced into the poem, however, suggest
very emphatically the occasion of it. It is addressed to Archibald,
Earl of Argyle, Chancellor of Scotland, who was killed at the battle of
Flodden in 1513. The Saxons assailed so virulently by the poet are, in
all likelihood, not the Lowland Scotch but the English, and the poem
is probably a ‚ÄúBrosnachadh catha,‚Äù or incitement to the rising of the
Scotch, and particularly the Argyle men, previous to the disastrous
battle of Flodden. This invests the fragment with peculiar historical
interest. There seems not to be much of the poem wanting, probably only
a few lines.

[224] Ireland.

[225] There was an Innis Aingin, an island in the Shannon, famous as
being the place to which St. Ciaran retired to spend the latter part
of his life. It is here apparently taken to represent a portion of
Ireland. See Mr. O‚ÄôCurry‚Äôs Lect. p. 58.

[226] An early race of pirates, said to have infested the Irish coasts.
The word is said to be derived from ‚Äúfo mhuir,‚Äù _under the sea_, and is
supposed to indicate their coming from the low sea coasts of Holland or
Denmark.

[227] Archibald, Earl of Argyle, Chancellor of Scotland, who was killed
at Flodden in 1513. He is called Iarla ‚ÄúOirthir Ghaidheal,‚Äù _The
sea-coast of the Gael_, which would seem to be the true etymology of
‚ÄúArgyle.‚Äù

[228] Colin, second Earl of Argyle, and Chancellor of Scotland, who
married Isabella, second daughter of Stewart, Lord of Lorn.

[229] Sir Archibald, first Earl of Argyle, called ‚ÄúGillespuig Ruadh,‚Äù
_Archibald the red_.

[230] Sir Duncan of Argyle, commonly called ‚ÄúDunchadh an aigh,‚Äù or
_Duncan of good fortune_.

[231] Sir Colin of Argyle, called ‚ÄúCailean iongantach,‚Äù _wonderful
Colin_, and also ‚ÄúCailean maith,‚Äù _good Colin_.

[232] Sir Archibald of Argyle, called ‚ÄúGilleaspuig m√≤r,‚Äù _Archibald the
great_.

[233] Sir Colin of Argyle, called ‚ÄúCailean √≤g,‚Äù _young Colin_, son of
Neil, son of Colin, called ‚ÄúCailean m√≤r,‚Äù from whom the family take the
patronymic of ‚ÄúMac Chailein mh√≤ir,‚Äù _The son of great Colin_. Cailean
m√≤r was also called ‚ÄúCailean na Sreang,‚Äù from a mountain between Loch
Awe and Lorn, where he was killed in a feud with the Macdougalls. (MS.

    The history of the secret origin of John Mac Patrick,[235]
    Why should I conceal it?
    What belongs to his race is not feeble,
    The bearing of that race we love.
    Seldom of a feeble race it is,
    Among the Gael of purest fame,
    That inquiry of their origin is made,
    By the men who read in books.
    Firm the belief to them and me,
    During the evening time so dark,
    That in the blood of noble kings
    Were the rights of true clan Gregor.
    Now that I‚Äôm by thy green dwelling,
    Listen, John, to thy family story:
    A root of the very root we are,
    Of famous kings of noble story.
    Know that Patrick was thy father,
    Malcom father was to Patrick.
    Son of black John, not black his breast,
    Him who feasts and chariots owned.
    Another John was black John‚Äôs father,
    Son of Gregor, son of John the lucky.
    Three they were of liberal heart,
    Three beneficent to the Church.
    The father to that learned John,
    Was Malcom, who his wealth ne‚Äôer hid,
    Son of Duncan, surly and small,
    Whose standard never took reproach.
    His father was another Duncan,
    Son of Gillelan of the ambush,
    Noble he was, giving to friends,
    Son of the famous Hugh from Urquhay.
    Kennan[236] of the pointed spear,
    Of Hugh from Urquhay was the father.
    From Alpin,[237] of stately mien and fierce,
    Mighty king of weighty blows.
    This is the fourth account that‚Äôs given
    Of thee, who art the heir of Patrick.
    Remember well thy back-bone line,
    Down from Alpin, heir of Dougal.
    Twenty and one, besides thyself,
    John the black, not black in heart.
    Thy genealogy leads us truly
    To the prosperous Fergus M‚ÄôErc.
    Of thy race, which wastes not like froth,
    Six generations wore the crown.
    Forty kings there were and three,
    Their blood and origin are known.
    Three there were north and three to the south,[238]
    After the time of Malcom Kenmore.
    Ten of the race did wear the crown,
    From the time of Malcom up to Alpin.
    From Alpin upwards we do find
    Fourteen kings till we reach Fergus.
    Such is thy genealogy
    To Fergus,[239] son of Erc the prosperous.
    How many are there of thy race,
    Must have been from thee to Fergus!
    Noble the races mix with thy blood,
    Such as now we cannot number.
    The schools[240] would weary with our tale,
    Numbering the kings from whom thou‚Äôrt sprung.
    The blood of Arthur[241] is in thy bosom,
    Precious is that which fills thy veins;
    The blood of Cuan, the blood of Conn,[242]
    Two wise men, glory of the race.
    The blood of Grant in thy apple-red cheek,
    The blood of Neil, the fierce and mighty.
    Fierce and gentle, at all times,
    Is the story of the royal race.
                                The history.

[234] This author is one of the writers of the MS., and a Macgregor.
By referring to the genealogy at p. 143 of the MS., we find him
designating himself as Dunchadh daoroglach, Mac Dhughaill, Mhic Eoin
riabbaich--Duncan the apprentice, son of Dougall, son of John the
grizzled.

[235] John dow M‚ÄôPatrick M‚ÄôGregor of Glenstrae, who died in 1526.

[236] This is manifestly a mistake for Kenneth. The person meant is
Kenneth M‚ÄôAlpin, King of Scotland. In the genealogy given in p. 144 of
the MS., this Kennan is said to have been high King of Scotland, to
distinguish him from lesser chiefs, whom the Celts called kings.

[237] Alpin, King of the Scots, who flourished in the beginning of the
ninth century. Several of the links in the Macgregor genealogy must be
wanting in this poem. Even the name of Gregor, from whom the clan is
called, does not appear at all.

[238] Both sides of Loch Tay, the ancient Macgregor territory, are
still called ‚ÄúTuaruith‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeasruith,‚Äù _north and south sides_.

[239] First king of the Dalriadic Scots.

[240] The schools of the bards, which abounded in Scotland and Ireland
at this period, chiefly in Ireland, as may be discovered from this
collection, for most of the composers were undoubtedly trained there.
Poetry and genealogy were the chief branches studied.

[241] Arthur, King of the Strathclyde Britons, from whom the Campbells
also are said to be descended.

[242] ‚ÄúConn ceud catha,‚Äù _Conn of the hundred battles_, King of
Ireland.

    Displeased am I with the south wind,
    Which hinders the coming of John,[244]
    And that he is kept away out,
    On his way from the north to M‚ÄôLeod.
    Janet‚Äôs son, of whitest sails,
    Well would he like to cross the sea;
    But the south wind will not listen
    To John, William‚Äôs son of swift steeds.
    By night or by day as I sleep,
    From the beach I see to the north,
    The rushing bark of whitest sails,
    The bark of him who stays defeat.
    This is the fame which every man
    Awards to M‚ÄôWilliam from Clar Sgith,[245]
    An ardent, white-toothed, ready youth,
    One who for aught he did ne‚Äôer mourned.
    This is the eighth day without John,
    Heir to M‚ÄôLeod of bluest eye;
    Like he is in mien and strength
    To the great house of liberal heart.
    Cheerful he is, does nought conceal,
    Such is the fame of sharp-armed John.
    In battle‚Äôs day he takes the lead,
    Ever ready fame to win.
    William‚Äôs son, my foster child,
    Son to Janet, royal her race,
    Did I but hear thou cam‚Äôst from the north,
    All my gloom would disappear.

[243] This name is very indistinct in the MS., and cannot be given with
certainty.

[244] In 1480, William Macleod of Dunvegan was killed at the battle of
the Bloody Bay, and was succeeded by his son Alexander, usually called
‚ÄúAlastair Crotach,‚Äù or _hump-backed_ (Greg. High. p. 74). The charters
give no information as to John, if a son of this William Macleod. But
William‚Äôs father was John, whose father was also in all likelihood a
William; and this John, whose _floreat_ was early in the fifteenth
century, might be the person here meant.

[245] The old name for Skye, and throws some doubt on the derivation of
the name ‚ÄúSgiathanach,‚Äù usually accepted.


The author of this is Mac Gillindak,[246] the man of songs.


    Lords have precedence of chiefs,
    It has been so from the beginning;
    It is commendable in young men,
    That each should have knowledge of this.
    The first who was lord of this land
    Was Duncan beg (little) of the great soul,
    He who as a legacy has left
    Their bravery to clan Gregor.
    Duncan, great by many spoils,
    Was the blessed father of Malcom;
    Grandfather he was to princely John,
    Him who never broke his pledge.
    Gregor, excellent son of Duncan,
    Was son to John, and was his heir;
    Famous man he was of the country,
    From the bright shore of Loch Tullich,[247]
    Swarthy John, so pure in speech,
    Princely son of John M‚ÄôGregor,
    Hunter of the well-formed deer,
    He like a king aye led the fight.
    Malcom of unbending truth,
    Know thou John, succeeds his father,
    Southwards in fair Glenurchay,
    Handsome he was amongst its valleys.
    The first place ‚Äômong their ancestors
    Is given by the Saxon to clan Gregor,
    Of whom were three chiefs loved the hunt,
    And were most active in the fight.
    In the days of Conn of hundred battles,
    I heard of something like this,
    Of Finn of spears and sharp sword,
    Cumhal‚Äôs son of famous deeds:
    That of Erin the hunting and lordship
    Belonged to Mac Cumhal of long locks,
    Patrimony and lordship he hadn‚Äôt
    Over the lands of the race of Gaul.
    Forest right they had all his life,
    From Kerry north to Carn Valair.
    But he possessed the old rights
    Which previously were his.
    From Hallowmas on to Beltin,
    His Feinn had all the rights.
    The hunting without molestation,
    Was theirs in all the forests.
    Many the tributes I cannot tell,
    Belonged to Finn and his men.
    Tribute in Erin possessed
    By Mac Cumhail from the forests.
    A noble‚Äôs forest right to the Feinn,
    On the banks of every stream.
    But Malcom‚Äôs large tributes
    Did not belong to Mac Muirn;[248]
    Finn himself would never hunt
    Without first asking leave.
    The hunting of Scotland, without leave,
    Belongs, with its spoil, to Malcom.
    Constant in the hunt together
    Are M‚ÄôGregor and his fierce men;
    No oftener did the blood-red hounds
    Enter the fort of clan Boisgne.
    A fighting band of chieftains
    Arose with him in battle‚Äôs day,
    Men whose dress sparkled with gold,
    Men who conquered in the fight.
    The head of clans and of huntsmen
    Is the common fame of his race.
    No trial of bravery or skill
    Will show weakness in M‚ÄôGregor.
    Many in his halls are found together,
    Men who carried well-sharped swords,
    Red gold glittered on their hilts,
    The arms of the lion of Loch Awe.
    Harmonious music among harps,
    Men with dice-boxes in their hands,
    Those who leave the game of tables,
    Go and lead forth the hounds.
    Mac Gregor of red-pointed palms,
    Son of Dervail, the Saxon‚Äôs terror,
    No hand like his amidst the fight,
    He ‚Äôtis that ever victory won.
    Liberal he ever was to bards,
    Gifts which Mac Lamond[249] knows to earn.
    Famous for managing his hounds,
    A hand so ready with its gifts.
    Mary, who stands by his side,
    Of noble mind and handsome form,
    Poets unite to give her praise,
    Her with cheeks as berries red.
                                   Lords.

[246] We have no tradition respecting this poet. But he must have been
a bard of the M‚ÄôGregors‚Äô. The allusion to the Feinn will be understood
by referring to the war-song of Gaul.

[247] Elsewhere translated Loch Tummell. ‚ÄúTolve‚Äù is the word in the
original. Loch Tullich lies at the head of Glenurchay.

[248] This is usually the name of Gaul, but here it is Finn, whose
mother‚Äôs name was Muirn.

[249] Probably the chief bard of the MacGregors.


The author of this is Finlay, the red-haired bard.[250]


    The one demon of the Gael is dead,
    A tale ‚Äôtis well to remember,
    Fierce ravager of Church and cross,
    The bald-head, heavy, worthless boar.
    First of all from hell he came,
    The tale‚Äôs an easy one to tell,
    Armed with the devil‚Äôs venomous spear.
    But he was surely, firmly bound,
    Ere quitting the black house of hell,
    To the same stronghold to return,
    And leave the Star of Paradise.
    Then, when came the black skinned boar,
    Many the devils in his train,
    Each of them with horrid sound,
    Their voices all in one loud strain.
    Lest that he should nothing have,
    It was apportioned by Mac Ruarie,[251]
    As a covenant firmly fixed,
    That in hell he‚Äôd live a dog.
    Righteous and just is now the claim
    Which Allan has against the devils.
    Whatever share may be their own,
    He, I think, should have much glory.
    ‚ÄôTis time to cease now from that band,
    Of horrid sounds, and cruel heart.
    Mac Ruarie from the ocean far,
    Wealth thou‚Äôst got without an effort.
    ‚ÄôTis a report we can‚Äôt neglect,
    For with Columba I must meet,
    ‚ÄôTis a report that fills the land,
    Bald-head Allan, thou so faithless,
    That thou hast, not thine only crime,
    Ravaged I[252] and Relig[253] Oran.
    Fiercely didst thou then destroy
    Priests‚Äô vestments and vessels for the mass.
    Thou art Inche Gall‚Äôs[254] great curse,
    Her revenue and stronghold spoil‚Äôst;
    Thou art the man whose heart is worst
    Of all who followed have thy chief,
    Save one who stands at his left hand,
    And he, Mac Ruarie, is thy brother.
    Now thy fight we never hear,
    But from the cross we hear thee cursed;
    The two are good who are about thee,
    Black indeed they are in form.
    At the time thou first mad‚Äôst war,
    There was the Abbot‚Äôs horrid corpse,
    Besides that other lawless raid
    Against Finan[255] in Glengarry.
    Thine own cruel, hateful deeds,
    Have cursed thy bald-head body, Allan,
    Just as crime will always do,
    Revenge itself on who commits it.
    The country side, with its protest,
    Has stamped mad rage on Allan‚Äôs face.
    Thine own country and thy friends,
    Thou hast cruelly oppressed.
    The last of thy goodness was lost
    Between the Sheil and the Hourn,
    ‚ÄôTis no wonder thou didst keep
    Far away, Allan, from the gallows.
    The fame which men had given thee,
    Extends to thy mother and thy sister.
    Time it is to cease from satire,
    Worthless, cruel son of Ruarie.
    Though learning which helps not manners,
    The sound of thy wailing is pleasant.
                            The one demon.

    The son has been found like his father,[256]
    Above all chiefs whom we have known,
    His bearing, countenance, and mind,
    And with me he dwells in Lewis.
    The knowledge and mind of a chief,
    With which he‚Äôll make prosperous times.
    I say of this young son we‚Äôve got,
    That he is just another Roderick;[257]
    How like each other are their locks,
    His father‚Äôs honour to his ringlets.
    In battle, too, how like the praise
    Of Torquil[258] and his famous father.
    Of all that in Torquil‚Äôs time may come,
    None of his friends shall suffer loss,
    Great deeds and victories will be,
    Such as Mac Calman[259] may relate.
    Many his gifts which we might praise,
    Torquil of the famous race;
    His are a hero‚Äôs strength and vigour,
    Which he brings into the fight.
    I say of him, and say in truth,
    Since I have come so well to know him,
    That never was there of his age
    Better king who ruled in Lewis.
    To him belonged the ‚ÄúCairge mhordha,‚Äù[260]
    The richest jewel sailed the sea,
    Given it was to Mac Vic Torquil,
    With which to reach his people‚Äôs land.
    Mac Ruarie of cheerful music,
    Had also the old cleaving sword,
    Another jewel of sure effect,
    ‚ÄôTwas given him by the King of Aineach.[261]
    Since he so many presents had,
    ‚ÄôTwas needless for him to go and seek.
    A shield he had cleft in the head,
    Another jewel, sounding loud.
    Without he had a noble herd
    Of horses, with their trappings red;
    ‚ÄôTwouldn‚Äôt suit a man like him
    Not to have many swift-paced steeds.
    His was the Du Seivlin,
    M‚ÄôLeod‚Äôs, whom the bards would sing.
    ‚ÄôTwas hard for those to take that horse,
    Whoe‚Äôer they were that might him seek.
    Torquil had many youths
    Who never trembled in battle,
    Who for his race seized on all lands,
    A race that aye the conflict loved.
    Not braver of his age was Cuchullin,
    Not hardier was he than Torquil,
    Him of the ready, vigorous arm,
    Who boldly breaks through any breach.
    Beloved though Mac Vic Torquil is,
    I can‚Äôt enough his beauty praise;
    He who is fair as he is the brave,
    The key to every woman‚Äôs heart.
    There is no son of king or chief
    Of whose fame we‚Äôve ever heard,
    Though we‚Äôve had much to do with such,
    That better are to us than Torquil.
    Catherine,[262] daughter of Mac Cailen,
    Whose soft hand‚Äôs worthy of thy race,
    Daughter of the Earl of Argyle,
    Best of the women we have found.
    To our isle we‚Äôve got a woman,
    Branch of a great and famous tree.
    Daughter of Mac Cailen, young and gentle,
    Whose locks in flowing ringlets fall.
                                The son.

[250] It has been suggested to the Editor that this poet might have
been the chief of the Macnabs, the chief of this period being Finlay
Macnab of Boquhan; and we know that the Macnabs counted themselves of
the same lineage with the Macgregors. There is much in the composition
given here, however, to indicate his being an ecclesiastic.

[251] We learn from Greg. High. pp. 65, 66, that Allan MacRuari,
great-grandson of Ranald, and chief of clan Ranald, was one of the
principal supporters of Angus, the young Lord of the Isles, at the
battle of the Bloody Bay; and that he also followed Alexander of
Lochalsh in his invasion of Ross and Cromarty in 1491, receiving a
large share of the booty taken on the occasion. The poet describes him
as a sacrilegious marauder.

[252] The ecclesiastical establishment at Iona. The Reformers had
probably less to do with the destruction of the buildings in Iona than
is generally thought.

[253] The church of St. Oran in Iona.

[254] The Hebrides were known as ‚ÄúInnsegall,‚Äù or _the islands of the
strangers_, probably since the rise of the kingdom of the Norsemen
there.

[255] The church of Kilfinan, at the east end of Loch Lochy, where is
still the burying-place of the M‚ÄôDonells of Glengarry.

[256] There is no author‚Äôs name given for this spirited eulogy. The
author was probably a family bard of the Siol Torcuil, or M‚ÄôLeods of
Lewis.

[257] Roderick M‚ÄôLeod of Lewis was head of the Siol Torcuil, or _sons
of Torquil_, in 1493. (Greg. High. p. 73.)

[258] Torquil was second son of Roderick M‚ÄôLeod of Lewis, the eldest
having been killed in the battle of the Bloody Bay. Torquil was
forfeited for harbouring Donald dubh, son of Angus Og of Islay. (Greg.
High. p. 73.)

[259] Probably the chief bard of the Siol Torcuil.

[260] ‚ÄúCairbhe‚Äù is _a ship_. This was probably the name of Torquil‚Äôs
galley, although spelled ‚Äúcairge‚Äù by the Dean.

[261] ‚ÄúAineach,‚Äù a castle of the O‚ÄôKanes, within a few miles of Derry.
The King of Aineach was chief of the O‚ÄôKanes.

[262] Catharine, daughter of Colin, 2d Earl of Argyle, who married
Torquil Macleod of the Lewis.


The author of this is Gilliecalum Mac an ollave.[263]


    The cause of my sorrow is come,
    This year has not prospered with me;
    Foolish who cannot understand
    How my grief has on me come;
    He who cannot understand
    How my grief has come at once;
    Since these wounds my body got,
    Such wounds I‚Äôve got I mourn.
    Pleasant now, though bitter too,
    To mourn my sad distress;
    Sorrow fills my inmost heart,
    Great was my love for him who‚Äôs gone;
    My heart is broken in twain,
    No wonder it should be so;
    My body has neither flesh nor blood,
    Like a strengthless sufferer.
    ‚ÄôTis no wonder if I so grieve
    For Margaret‚Äôs[264] son who now is gone,
    Remembering all his virtues,
    And that chiefless we are left.
    Sore is the loss that he is gone,
    Now that in the world we‚Äôre weak,
    My grief now that thy days are ended,
    Is the injury done by Angus.[265]
    Though it be hard for me to part
    With John‚Äôs[266] son of sweetest speech,
    What is worst of all is this,
    That ne‚Äôer to his place he‚Äôll return.
    Though I were from happiness far,
    Pursued by my foes‚Äô reproach,
    Whatever good might me o‚Äôertake,
    From them never would I buy.
    No wonder though heavy my heart,
    As another lord‚Äôs seen in thy place,
    That my whole man should be feeble,
    Now that my king is dead.
    Bitter is my pain since he left,
    ‚ÄôTis easy the tale to relate,
    ‚ÄôTis hard my great sorrow to bear,
    For the hero so famous who‚Äôs gone.
    Great is my grief, and no wonder,
    My mourning is true, sincere;
    That which sorely has me pained,
    Is that in Albin we‚Äôve no race.[267]
    Now since that I must leave,
    As others with reproach me load,
    Since he is dead, I fain would go,
    Away from the rough isles of Albin.
    Yet ‚Äôtis sore for me to leave,
    Although I feel that go I must,
    Now that my beloved is dead,
    My country I must leave behind.
    Last of all, what grieves me is,
    And truly the cause is enough,
    That my beloved will not return,
    To Islay on this side of Innis.[268]
    And then, besides, it is so sad,
    That this during his time should come,
    Wringing hearts, and bodies rending,
    Without revenge being in our power.
    No men on earth could think
    How ready he was foes to crush,
    ‚ÄôTwas nothing both for us and thee
    That champions should come against us.
    But thy foes now have pierced thee,
    Pity we had not with thee died,
    Fair-handed, sweet-voiced son of Mary,
    That we should have none to help.
    He of the fairest countenance,
    Our loss is not to follow him.
    All the fame thou didst enjoy,
    Was such as to thy race belonged,
    They who had the long curled locks,
    Whose company men loved much.
    Now their hearts are sore depressed,
    Every comfort poor without thee.
    ‚ÄôTwould be hard to find one like me,
    And that from my lord I had,
    The fellowship of priests and poets;
    These are plenty, but his hand absent.
    When others to the banquet go,
    Of the honour my share is this,
    Ever to mourn in grief unchanged,
    And of sorrow drink my fill.
    ‚ÄôTis sad for me I do not follow,
    Much his absence do we grieve;
    And then o‚Äôer that which makes me mourn,
    Many the other men who weep.
    Many the men before our time,
    Who by sorrow were brought low;
    And what I‚Äôve said does find its proof,
    In a tale I‚Äôve told before.
    ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard a tale of old,‚Äù etc.[269]
    _As follows in another place._
    The fellow of this noble man,
    Foster-son of Caoimh and Conull.

[263] It has been said in a previous note that nothing is known of
this poet. But the present composition would indicate his being one
of the celebrated Beatons, physicians and sennachies to the Lords of
the Isles. There is a charter of lands in Islay, written in Gaelic by
Fergus Beaton in 1411. There were several of the family whose name was
Gilliecallum. ‚ÄúMac an Olaimh ‚Äù means _son of the physician_.

[264] Margaret Livingstone, daughter of Sir Alexander Livingstone,
married to Alexander Lord of the Isles.

[265] Angus Og, son of John last Lord of the Isles, who fought the
battle of the Bloody Bay against his father.

[266] John, son of Alexander Lord of the Isles.

[267] Both John and Angus, sons of the last Lord of the Isles, died
before their father. He was forfeited, and died in a monastery in
Paisley.

[268] This word is spelled ‚ÄúEithnis,‚Äù and ‚ÄúEinis,‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnis.‚Äù It is
translated _Angus_ and _Innis_. But it is difficult to decide which
it means; probably ‚ÄúInis‚Äù in Ulster, where the Lords of the Isles had
extensive possessions.

Blind Arthur Mac Gurkich.[270]


    The assembled fleet at Castle Sween,
    Pleasant tidings in Innisfail,
    Of all the riders of the waves,
    A finer ship no man e‚Äôer owned.
    Tall men did manage the ship,
    Men, I think, to urge their way;
    No hand without a champion,
    A slashing, vigorous, noble band.
    With coats of black all were supplied,
    In this bark, noble their race,
    Bands with their brown, broad belts,
    Danes and nobles were they all.
    Chieftains with ivory and gold,
    The crew on board this brown-sailed ship,
    Each with a sheaf of warriors‚Äô spears,
    Shields on their hooks hung round the sides.
    Wide-spread wings, speckled sails,
    Bearing purple, all of gems;
    A long, handsome, gentle band,
    Stood along the stout-made spars.
    The blue sea at the swift ship‚Äôs prow,
    The ship laden when the tide is full;
    Wattled baskets full of swords,
    With shields all brought on board the bark.
    Fair women, too, were in the ship,
    Modest, their beds were placed on high,
    Spotted cushions were provided,
    Couches for the nobles‚Äô wives.
    Spotted coverings of fine linen,
    This was the covering of the ship;
    Handsome, easy, as she rocked,
    Purple linen round each mast.
    No hardened hands, no tightened belt,
    Nor roughened by their usual toil;
    Heroes were there, nor did they labour,
    Bands of men of sweetest lips.
    We heard not of so many nobles,
    Of our isle from labour free;
    From Erin princely champions,
    A troop with soft and ruddy hair.
    Not ship of all did she count swifter,
    None has there been nor will be,
    No sigh, no sorrow, and no grief,
    Nor is there any end of all.
    No ship of ships she counted swift,
    Full of princely men she is,
    Scattering gold among the bards,
    While round the ship resounds the sea.
    Many the men of sword and spear,
    Many men quick in fight to mix;
    Down by the sea the fighting men,
    Above, the gentle women were.
    Who is he provides this fleet,
    At Castle Sween[271] of many hills?
    A vigorous man who fears no blast,
    His masts upraised, seeking his right.
    John M‚ÄôSween,[272] sail thou the ship,
    On the ocean‚Äôs fierce-topped back;
    Raise aloft the vessel‚Äôs masts,
    Let thy bark now test the sea.
    A leading wind then for them rose,
    At Kyle Aca[273] as rose the tide;
    The speckled sails were roundly bellied,
    As John ran swiftly for the land.
    We entered the cheerful anchorage
    In the bay of fruitful Knapdale;[274]
    The noble hero, lordly, shapely,
    Comely, masted, swift, victorious,
    He was then near Albin‚Äôs walls,
    Helpful, welcoming his men.
    Fair was then the youthful hero,
    Abundant dew distilling round,
    Favourable at Slieve Mun‚Äôs[275] streams,
    To Mac Sween, him of Slieve Mis.
    Speakers then come near to ask,
    They deal as with him of sharpest eye.
    Branches are laid beneath their knees,
    To welcome those of valour great.
    Their safety in each harbour nook
    Suffers from the welcome they give John.
    The men of Albin‚Äôs isles then come
    With welcome from the narrow sea.
    The men who sweetest are that sing,
    Tenfold welcomes to him bring.
    For a while there was a conflict,
    Between them and our men of song;
    They come at last to know full well,
    How fair the hill from whence came John.
    Then did we fight at Castle Sween,
    Just as a slender, furious hawk,
    We set us down around that rock,
    Every limb endowed with strength.
    We pierced the bodies of our foes,
    Just as a serpent fiercely wounds;
    Our thin-bladed, well-edged swords,
    The foreigners‚Äô bodies fiercely hacked.
    We raised the cry of great Mac Sween,
    Amidst the rolling of the sea;
    True it is that roll won‚Äôt help,
    Broad-backed, long although it be,
    Their javelins have no power to pierce
    The shields which our brown coats protect.
    Rathlin of the sharp rocks, hears
    The music of our ringing swords.
    The thin-bladed sword, in Europe best,
    A spear that swift obeys the wish,
    What shield on earth can it resist?
    Fierce and fearless Erin‚Äôs sons.
    John Mac Sween of stratagems,
    With his thin, powerful, cutting sword,
    He whose shield is spotted brown,
    A blind man found him brave and wise.
                        The assembled fleet.

[270] Who this blind poet was the Editor cannot say. He can find no
notice of him anywhere, nor of the attack on Castle Sween, which he
describes. He was an Irish bard, and composes in the Irish dialect,
making use, like the later Irish poets, of language much more difficult
to understand than the older composers. The Editor encountered more
difficulty in reading this piece, than in reading any other in the
Dean‚Äôs MS. ‚ÄúBroin‚Äù is an ancient word for a _troop_ or _band_, and
‚Äúcleath,‚Äù ‚Äúcomhlan,‚Äù ‚Äún√≤s,‚Äù are words for a _warrior_; but these words
are entirely obsolete; so ‚Äúglantair,‚Äù as the comparison of ‚Äúglan,‚Äù is
unknown in the modern language. There is a manifest attempt in the
composition to use obsolete words; but the Editor trusts the meaning
has been correctly rendered.

[271] We can find no trace in our history of this attack by the Irish
Mac Sweenys on Castle Sween. The event cannot be of a very ancient
date, as the Mac Sweenys are not a very ancient tribe in Ulster.

[272] One of the Mac Sweens or Mac Sweenys of Slieve Mis in Antrim.

[273] This cannot be Kyle Akin in Skye, but is probably the ancient
name of the entrance to Loch Sween.

[274] Knapdale, on the west coast of Argyle, south of Crinan.

[275] Not known to the Editor, but is probably on the Knapdale side of
Loch Sween.


Isabella Ni vic Cailein.[276]


    Pity whose complaint is love,
    Whate‚Äôer my reason thus to speak,
    ‚ÄôTis hard to separate from its object,
    Sad‚Äôs the condition I am in.
    The love which I in secret gave,
    Of which I‚Äôd better never speak,
    Unless I quickly get relief,
    Withered and thin I‚Äôll soon become.
    The man whom I have so loved,
    A love I never must confess;
    Has me put in lasting bonds,
    For me a hundred times ‚Äôtis pity.
                                  Pity.

[276] This lady is elsewhere called ‚ÄúContissa Ergadien,‚Äù _the Countess
of Argyle_. From the name given her here, she would appear to be a
daughter of the Earl of Argyle, but she might as countess be styled Ni
vic Cailein, or the daughter of Colin. We know that Sir Colin Campbell
of Glenurchy, was uncle and tutor to Archibald, first Earl of Argyle,
and that having himself married Margaret, eldest daughter of Stuart
last Lord of Lorn, he arranged a marriage between his nephew and
Isabella, the second daughter, who became Countess of Argyle. She was
most likely the authoress of these lines, but we have no key to the
piece of domestic history to which they refer.


The author of this is Duncan Og.[277]


    Seven arrows me assail,
    Each of the arrows does me wound;
    Between me and my God they come,
    Such of my body is the desire.
    The first one of these is Pride,
    Which wounds me under my belt,
    Often of a triumph it has me spoiled,
    Which otherwise I might obtain.
    The second arrow is Lust,
    To whose power I‚Äôm such a slave;
    Since this shaft trait‚Äôrously has me pierced,
    I cannot live beyond its reach.
    The third of these arrows is one
    Which pierces ‚Äômidst my very joints;
    Laziness, which suffers not
    That I the right way e‚Äôer should chuse.
    The fourth arrow is Covetousness,
    O God, ‚Äôtis mournful where it wounds;
    Deliverance I can never have
    From this load of earth upon my back.
    The fifth of these shafts is Gluttony,
    Which has brought me much reproach;
    Besides that it pains my self-respect,
    From it my body is not free.
    The sixth sore arrow of them all
    Is Anger, which me from men divides;
    May Mary stay them when they‚Äôre shot,
    Otherwise I have no help.
    The seventh shaft does pierce the eye,
    Envy, which grudges others‚Äô good;
    A shaft which, however we may feel,
    Is one which never does us good.
    When these in his hand the enemy takes,
    Many they are by‚Äôs arms destroyed;
    He never shoots but what he strikes,
    And never strikes but what he kills.
    Son of God, I‚Äôll place a pater,
    And the apostles‚Äô creed as well,
    Between me and these wounding arms,
    With five psalms, or six or seven.
                                   Seven.

[277] There is a Duncan Og Albanach among the writers of religious
poetry in the MS., who was most likely one of the Mac Vurrichs, and
the author of these lines. It is hardly necessary to say that the
poet refers in this composition to the seven mortal sins of the Roman
Catholic Church.


The author is Murdoch Albanach.[278]


    ‚ÄôTis time for me to go to the house of Paradise,
    While this wound‚Äôs not easily borne,
    Let me win this house, famous, faultless,
    While others can tell of us nought else.
    Confess thyself now to the priest,
    Remember clearly all thy sins;
    Carry not to the house of the spotless King,
    Aught that may thee expose to charge.
    Conceal not any of thy sins,
    However hateful its evil to tell;
    Confess what has been done in secret,
    Lest thou expose thyself to wrath.
    Make thy peace now with the clergy,
    That thou may‚Äôst be safe as to thy state;
    Give up thy sin, deeply repent,
    Lest its guilt be found in thee.
    Woe to him forsook the Great King‚Äôs house,
    For love of sin, sad is the deed;
    The sin a man commits in secret,
    Much is the debt his sin incurs.
    This is a sermon for Adam‚Äôs race,
    I think I‚Äôve nothing said that‚Äôs false,
    Though men may death for a time avoid,
    ‚ÄôTis true they can‚Äôt at length escape.
    Thou who hast purchased Adam‚Äôs race,
    Their blood, their body, and their heart,
    The things we cherish may‚Äôst thou assail,
    However we may them pursue.
                        ‚ÄôTis time.

[278] Murdoch of Scotland was the first of the great race of
Macvurrichs, bards to Macdonald of Clanranald. From all that can
be gathered regarding him, he was an ecclesiastic, and, according
to the measure of light he possessed, a man of earnest and sincere
religion. It was not known, until this volume of Dean M‚ÄôGregor‚Äôs was
searched, that any remains of his compositions existed; but here we
find several, all very much of the same character. There is one long
poem to the cross, which appears to have been modelled on the early
Latin hymns. Murdoch of Scotland, or Muireadhach Albanach, would appear
to have lived between A.D. 1180 and 1220. Mr. Standish H. O‚ÄôGrady,
late President of the Ossianic Society of Dublin, kindly sent to the
writer some years ago a poem, still preserved in Ireland, containing
a dialogue between Muireadhach and ‚ÄúCathal Cr√≤dhearg,‚Äù the red-handed
Cathal O‚ÄôConnor, King of Connaught, on the occasion of their embracing
a religious life. Cathal‚Äôs ‚Äúfloruit‚Äù is known to have been between A.D.
1184 and 1225. As the lines are curious, they are inserted here.

TRANSLATION.

    Cathal Crodhearg and Murdoch of Scotland,
    on entering among the brethren, sung:--

    Murdoch, whet thy knife, that we may shave our crowns to the
          Great King,
    Let us sweetly give our vow, and the hair of both our heads to
          the Trinity.
    I will shave mine to Mary, this is the doing of a true heart,
    To Mary shave thou these locks, well-formed, soft-eyed man.
    Seldom hast thou had, handsome man, a knife on thy hair to shave it,
    Oftener has a sweet, soft queen, comb‚Äôd her hair beside thee.
    Whenever it was that we did bathe, with Brian of the
          well-curled locks,
    And once on a time that I did bathe, at the wall of the
          fair-haired Boroimhe,
    I strove in swimming with Ua Chais, on the cold waters of
          the Fergus.
    When he came ashore from the stream, Ua Chais and I strove
          in a race.
    These two knives, one to each, were given us by Duncan Cairbreach,
    No knives of knives were better, shave gently then, Murdoch.
    Whet your sword, Cathal, which wins the fertile Banva,
    Ne‚Äôer was thy wrath heard without fighting, brave,
          red-handed Cathal,
    Preserve our shaved heads from cold and from heat, gentle daughter
          of Joachim,
    Preserve us in the land of heat, softest branch, Mary.
                                                           Murdoch.




The above Murdoch.


    That there should be in God‚Äôs Son‚Äôs heart
    A sinner like me, how great the tale,
    And that there should to me be given,
    On my lips to have the cross of Jesus Christ.
    Jesus Christ, sanctify as thou art wont,
    My two feet, and my two hands,
    Sanctify me of thy good will,
    Even my blood, and flesh, and bones.
    I never cease committing sin,
    Because that my body loves it well;
    May consecration come from afar,
    Upon my head and on my heart.
    Glorious great One, save thou me
    From every grief which me has seized,
    Ere I‚Äôm laid beneath the turf,
    May my way be plain and smooth.
                                That.


The author of this is Murdoch Albanach.


    Thou Trinity, do thou me teach,
    Thou Lord, whose praise all men must sing,
    Thou Trinity, come on my tongue,
    Bless it in thy judgment great.
    Holy Trinity in the heavens,
    Strengthen thou my spiritual arms;
    Come to, and dwell in my heart,
    Thou head of all thy holy race.
    Guide thou my hand, and teach my heart,
    Teach my eye, thou King of truth;
    Come to my voice, move on my tongue,
    Quicken my ear, and bless my lips.
    This is the mouth which ye have torn,
    Which checks men‚Äôs conflicts, nought forgets;
    This is the tongue that ne‚Äôer spared speech,
    Bless it, Beloved of my soul.
    From thee, O Trinity, alas! O Trinity,
    Let healing come, speak thou to me;
    There is, as in the white-wood oak,
    In me a sinful, corrupt heart.
    Though sinful, I never man destroyed,
    Ne‚Äôer did I steal, O Son of God;
    Never did my hand slay man,
    For Mary‚Äôs love, answer thou me.
    ‚ÄôTis true, I‚Äôve made lying refuges,
    Deceived by lies of men of fame,
    Building on others‚Äô lie my lie,
    O King, shall I in this succeed?
    Thou who in me prayer begett‚Äôst,
    ‚ÄôTis no sin to follow thee;
    ‚ÄôTwas neither righteous men nor great,
    But God a refuge found for me.
    No man in this world can me teach,
    But only thou, O Lord, alone,
    None keepeth truth but heaven‚Äôs King,
    To His wisdom none is like,
    If I am in the way of truth,
    My tonsure vow requires it all;
    If, O Trinity, on a lie I rest,
    Lead me to the way of truth.
    Earth or clay shall not me cover,
    But waves of judgment, little the wrath,
    Nothing else shall be to hide me,
    But, O King, burning red-flamed fire.
    Trinity, thou mad‚Äôst this world,
    Both of fire and of earth;
    Of earth and fire all men are made,
    So at the end it will be found.

    Do dh‚Äô fh√†g sinn a chorp air tr√†igh, air a lot fo bhuille na Feinn,
    De shluaghaibh an domhain tr√©in, ni ‚Äôn deachaidh uainn f√©in ‚Äôs
          an √†ir
    Ach r√¨gh na Fraince mar e, ainlinn ‚Äôs e breith air an √†il;
    Air eagal an Osgair oill, cha do leig e a bhuinn air l√†r,
    Gu Gleannabaltan mar tha ‚Äôtheisd, is ann do ghabh e fois ‚Äôus t√†mh.
    Air tr√†igh Fionntraigh a chuain, far na chuir na sloigh an t-√†ir,
    Air righribh an domhain tr√©in, do dh‚Äô √≤l sinn f√©in ar s√†r,
    Do b‚Äô iomadh o fhraoich ar n‚Äô arm, laoich a bha marbh air an l√†r,
    Do b‚Äô iomadh claidheamh ‚Äôus sgiath, ‚Äôn am bloighibh shear air
          an tr√†igh,
    Air traigh Fionntraigh nam port, do b‚Äô iomadh ann corp fhear√†n,
    Do b‚Äô iomadh laoich fo gh√†ire baoibh, ‚Äôus do b‚Äô iomadh ann
          faoibh √†ir.
    A Phadruig mhic Alpain √†il, ni ‚Äôn d‚Äô thainig de ‚Äôr Feinn o thr√†igh,
    Ach da chath eagar gun lochd, agus ni ‚Äôn robh an corp sl√†n.
    Cath de chlannaibh Baoisgne dhiubh, buidheann noch char
          mhean an l√†mh,
    Cath de chlannaibh Moirne nan grath, agus an darna le clannaibh
          Sm√†il.
    Air bhur l√†mhsa a thailginn thr√©ine, ‚Äôs e dh‚Äô fh√†g sinn de ‚Äôr
          F√©inn ‚Äôs an √†ir,
    Coig cathan eagar de ‚Äôr sluagh, a leigeadh uainn air an tr√†igh,
    Deich cath fichead gun rath, deich ceud fichead gach cath dhiubh,
    De dh‚Äô √†ireimh sluaigh Dhaire dhuinn, nach d‚Äô rainig air tonn a r√¨s.
    A thailginn da freagrann cl√©ir, o b‚Äô aill leat uam f√©in gach sgeul,
    Gu tugadh cath Ghabhra nan gleann, noch cha tainig ceann ar la.
    Do rinneadh sinn a gabhail long, agus airgiod trom an r√¨gh,
    An t-√≤r, ‚Äôs an eideadh, ‚Äôs an ni, ‚Äôan Eirinn air gach leth di.
    A Phadruig mhaith nam mionna, ann ad chill am faigheam b√†s?
    Cuir f√©in talamh air mo chneas, o ‚Äôs agad tha fios mo sgeul.
    Ossiain, o tha tu sg√¨th, dean a nis do sh√¨th gu b√†s,
    Gabh d‚Äô √πrnuighean ‚Äôus iarr tlus, ‚Äôus guidh Dia moch gach la,
    Air sliabh Sion la luain, agus na sluaigh air an l√†r,
    Michal ‚Äôus Muire ‚Äôus mac Dh√©‚Äô do thoirt f√©in air an laimh.
    An da abstol deug ‚Äôs a bhlaith, gach cleireach maith ‚Äôs gach faidh,
    Edaram agus Ifrionn, oir do bhi gu cruaidh air mo la.

Is e √πghdair so Ossian mac Fhinn.

    Anmhunn an nochd neart mo laimh, ni bheil mo choimhghin er l√†r,
    Is ni ioghnadh dhomh bhi br√≤nach, ‚Äôam ghiobul truagh seanarach,
    Truagh gach ni cheadaich domh, seach gach duine air tuinn talmhainn,
    Bhi tarruing chlach a shallain, gu relig thulaich an tailghin,
    Tha ursgeul again dhuit, air ar dheadh mhuinntir, Phadruig,
    Eisd ri f√†istneachd Fhinn, seal beag air teachd do ‚Äôn tailginn.
    Brughainn do rinn an sonn, air sliabh Chuailgne maola lom,
    Do chuir air Fianaibh Fail, aobhair ann do thionail.
    Da thrian de ‚Äôn bhrughainn bhreagh, chuir Fionn air Clanna Moiru,
    Agus an trian eile dheth ormsa, agus air clannaibh Baoisgne.
    Thugas freagradh nar choir, air mac Cumhail mhic Threunmhoir;
    Thubhairt nach bithinn fad fo a smachd, ‚Äôs nach deanainn
          da g√©illeadh.
    Do bha Fionn fada ‚Äôn a thosd an laoch, nach b‚Äô fhurasd a chosgadh,
    Fear gun on gun eagal, ‚Äôn uair a chual an dubh-fhreagradh,
    Is e an c√≤mhradh do radh rium, flath ainbhtheach na Feinn, Fionn,
    Bithidh tu seal a tarruing chlach, ma ‚Äôn d‚Äô theid thu ‚Äôna
          bhith bhr√≤nach,
    Do dh‚Äô eireas sin ri feirg suas, o mhac Cumhail rinn-dhearg,
    Is e lean mi de ‚Äôn Fheinn ainbhtheach, an ceathramh cath
          cruaidh-chalm,
    Fasdair mise aig an Fheinn, bheircar roimhse mo bhreth f√©in,

    Fa mi an comhairleach crodha, do ‚Äôn Fheinn an cath cruinnbheum.

Is e ughdair so Ossian.

    Aithnichte domh sgeul beag air Fionn, ni sgeul nach cuirear an suim,
    Air Mac Cumhail fa maith goil, fa cuimhne sin ri ‚Äôm r√©.
    Do bha sinn beagan sluaigh, aig Easruadh nan eagan mall,
    Do chi sinn fo she√≤l air tr√†idh, currach m√≤r ‚Äôus bean ann.
    Caogad laoch guineach mu ‚Äôn r√¨gh, fa maith air ghniomh air
          gach gart,
    Fir d‚Äô ar n-eis is mairg a chite, do ghabhamaid air gach t√¨r neart.
    Do eireamar uile gu dion, ach Fionn nam Fiann ‚Äôus Gall,
    Do fheitheamh a churraich fa h-airde ceum, bha ‚Äôn a reim
     a sgoltadh nan tonn.
    Ni dheanadh t√†mh ann a teachd, gu ‚Äôr ghabh cala ‚Äôs a phort ghn√†th.
    Aig teachd do th√¨r an eas, do eirich as maca mnatha,
    Gile a dealradh no sitheadh gr√©ine, ‚Äôus is m√¨n n√≤s a deilbh;
    An ainnir a thainig an c√©in, do bhamaid f√©in roimpe soirbh.
    Thig thugainn gu pubull Fhinn, ‚Äôus beannaicheas gu grinn doibh,
    Fhreagair Mac Cumhail ‚Äôna aonar, am beannachd binn gun toigh,
    Do fharraid an r√¨gh fa maith dreach, gu h-ard do nighean an
          dath ghloin,
    Co ‚Äôn treabh as an d‚Äô thainig a bhean, thoir sgeul gu geur dhuinn.
    Nighean mi r√¨gh th√¨r fo thuinn, innisid gu cruinn mo dh√†il,
    Ni bheil treabh fa ‚Äôn iadh grian, nar iarras f√©in do laoich fial,
    A rioghan a shiubhail gach r√≤id, a nighean √≤ig is maith dealbh,
    An tosga fa thainigeas an cein, tabhaireas doibh f√©in gu dearbh.
    Mo chomraich ort ma ‚Äôs tu Fionn, do r√†dh ruinn am maca mnatha,
    D‚Äô fheabhas d‚Äô √πrlabhraidh ‚Äôus do shluaigh, gabh mo chomraich
     gu luath tr√†th.
    Deir an r√¨gh fa maith fios, sloinn a nis co th‚Äô air do thi,
    Gabham ri ‚Äôd chomraich, a bhean, air gach fear dha ‚Äôm bheil
          an cridhe.
    Tha le fioch a teachd thar muir, laoch is maith goil air mo lorg,
    Mac r√¨gh na Sorcha is maith airm, ‚Äôus do ‚Äôn ainm an Daire Borb.
    Do chuireas geasan ‚Äôn a chionn, gum beireadh Fionn mi air s√†l,
    ‚ÄôUs nach bithinn aige mar mhnaoi, ge ‚Äôr mhaith a ghniomh ‚Äôus ‚Äô√†gh.
    Do r√†dh Osgar le gloir mh√®ar, am fear sin a chosg gach r√¨gh,
    Gun ge ‚Äôr f√≤ireadh Fionn do gheas, ni rachadh tu leis mar mhnaoi.
    Do chi sinn teachd thar steud, laoch ‚Äôs a mheud os gach fear,
    ‚ÄôSiubhal na fairge gu dian, ‚Äôs an i√πl cheudna ‚Äôghabh a bhean,
    Clogaid teann tighinn mu ‚Äôcheann, fa ‚Äôn fhear nar thioma ‚Äôus

    Sgiath chruinn dhubh air a dheas, a druim l√†n chleas air a cleibh,
    Claidheamh trom toirteal nach gann, gu teann air taobh an
          fhir mhoir,
    Ag imirt chleas os a chionn, ‚Äôus a teachd an connimh an t-sluaigh,
    A dha mhanais gaisge le buaidh, a seasamh an gualainn a sg√©ith,
    Air neart, air ghaisge, air ghoile, ni bheil fear mear ach e,
    Neul flath ‚Äôus rosg r√¨gh, an ceann an fhir fa caomh cruth,
    Maith a shnuadh ‚Äôus geal a dheud, is luaithe a steud no gach sruth,
    Thainig an steud sin air t√¨r, ‚Äôs am fear nar mh√¨n ris an Fheinn.
    Caogad laoch bhith‚Äômaid ann, a choinnich a dh‚Äô ionnsuidh an fhir,
    Air eagal an fhir ‚Äôus a theachd, ni robh laoch gun ghrain.
    De thuinn mar thainig air t√¨r, d‚Äô fharraid an r√¨gh fa maith cli√π,
    An aithnich thu f√©in a bhean, an e sud am fear a deir tu?
    Aithnicheam, Mhic Cumhail, a Fhinn, is p√πdhar leam e do d‚Äô Fheinn,
    Tairgidh se mise a bhreith leis, ge maith do threise, Fhinn aill,
    Do eirich Osgar agus Gall, bu bhorb cosgair lonn nan cath,
    ‚ÄôN an seasamh an goire do ‚Äôn t-sloigh, eadar am fear m√≤r ‚Äôs

    Thainig an laoch bu mhaith tlachd, le fioch ‚Äôus le neart
          ‚Äôn a cheann,
    Agus faigheas uainn a bhean, do bha ‚Äôn goire do ghualainn Fhinn,
    Thug Mac Moirne an t-urchar dian, gu cruaidh ‚Äôn a dheigh do ‚Äôn
          t-sleigh,
    Nior fann an t-urchar nior e, dhe ‚Äôsg√©ith gun d‚Äô rinneadh

    Do chrath Osgar fa m√≤ir fheirg a chrios dhearg dhe ‚Äôlaimh chl√¨,
    Agus marbhas steud an fhir, m√≤r an t-euchd a rinneadh leatha.
    ‚ÄôN uair thuit an steud air an leirg, dh‚Äô iompaich e le feirg ‚Äôus
     le fioch,
    Agus f√≤gras, borb an taom, comhrag air na caogad laoich.
    An taobh mo dh‚Äô ionnsuidh f√©in ‚Äôus d‚Äô Fhinn, caogad laoch nior

    Ge ‚Äôr mhaith an seasamh ‚Äôs an trosd, do gheill

    Bheireadh da bhuille gu mear, gu dian do gach fear dhiubh sin,
    Do bhitheamaid uile fa h-√πir, mar h-√πmh ag comhrag fir.
    Cheangail tri naoinear le buaidh, ‚Äôs an iorghuill chruaidh
          sul do sguir,
    Gu cruaidh ceangail nan tri chaoil, air gach aon diubh sin a chuir.
    Do dhruid Gall an aigne mhir, gu leadairt an fhir an goire roimhe,
    Cia b‚Äôe chitheadh iad an sin, bu gharbh an goile ‚Äôs an gle√≤;
    Thorchair Mac Moirne le a laimh, Mac r√¨gh na Sorcha, sgeul m√≤r;
    Is mairg treabh o ‚Äôn d‚Äô th√†inig a bhean, fa thuit am fear an
     goire romha.
    ‚ÄôUs air tuiteam an fhir mh√≤ir, an goire do ‚Äôn chuan,
          cruaidh an ceum,
    Do bhi nighean r√¨gh thir fo thuinn, bliadhna aig Fionn
          anns an Fheinn.
    Flann mac Moirne cruaidh ‚Äôan c√†s, fhuair b√†s, bu mh√≤r an t-euchd,
    Ni robh a thainig as dhiubh, gun a chneas l√†n de chreuchd:
    M‚Äô athairse f√©in bu mhaith tlachd, neach am bochd riamh nior eur.
    ‚ÄôUs nis is deireadh do ‚Äôn ghniomh, air Fionn is aithnichte

                                                Aithnichte domh sgeul.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Mar bha caogad laoch garbh, an d√†il an arm dha gu le√≤r,
    Bhitheamaid gun chobhar fo a smachd, do ghabhas uainn a ch√≤ir,
    Do bhitheadh an claidheamh gun tochd, a claoidh chorp agus sgiath,
    Co maith chomhrag air mo dheas ni fhaca mi ris air mo r√©idh.
    Adhlacar againn aig an eas, fear bu mhaith treis ‚Äôus gniomh,
    Cuirear fa bhr√†igh gach meur, fainne √≤ir an onoir mo r√¨gh,
    Deich bliadhna dhol an airm nimh, an laoch borb nior lughaich
          an r√¨gh,
    Mac Moirne fa d‚Äô fhios leam, ‚Äôga leigheas aig Fionn nam fleadh.

An t-√πghdair so sios, Allan Mac Ruaraidh.

    M√≤r an nochd mo chumha f√©in a thailginn a tha do ‚Äôm r√©ir,
    Ri smuaintinn a chatha chruaidh thugamar ‚Äôus Carbair crann ruaidh,
    Am mac sin Chormaig O‚ÄôChuinn, mairg an fheadhan a tharladh fo
          ‚Äôchuing,
    R√¨gh gun ch√†s o ‚Äôn chath do chuireadh leis gun ghrain roimh
          beothaibh,
    Cheangladh sinn gach uile Fiann, thun Fhinn ‚Äôus cloinne caoimh
          Chuinn,
    Gus do bhi sin Carbair ruadh, nior smuainich sinn olc no ainmhein.
    Do chan Carbair ris an t-sluagh, agus do b ‚Äôe an ealaidh chruaidh,
    Gur b‚Äô fhearr leis tuiteam air magh, agus an Fheinn le ch√©ile,
    No na righre bhi fa √πir, agus an Fheinn a bhi air Eirinn.
    Do chan Barruinn gu prap, cuimhnich Mucraidh agus Art,
    Bhur sinnsreadh thuiteam an sin, de bhreith foill na Feinn,
    Cuimhnich na geasan chruaidh, ‚Äôus cuimhnich an on uamhor,
    ‚ÄôUs nach robh aon chogadh ri ‚Äôm linn, ach na thog Mac Cumhail.
    B‚Äôe comhairle chlanna Chuinn, agus Charbair na laimhe truime,
    Iad f√©in a thabhairt do ‚Äôr cinn, agus sinne a dhochainneadh,
    Gu maireadh ‚Äôn a dheidh fleadh, ‚Äôus gun Fheinn a bhi ‚Äôn Almhainn,
    ‚ÄôUs bhitheas b√†s fa dhiomb, an trath nach bitheas ann mar dhlighe.
    Thug sinn gu fiadhaich feargach, an cath sin cath Ghabhra.
    Do thuit an Fheinn bonn ri bonn ‚Äôus righre uasal Eirinn.
    Ni robh o ‚Äôn Innia an ear, gu Fodla iar an domhain,
    Aon righ nach robh fo ‚Äôr smachd, r ‚Äôar linn gus a chath sin,
     a thailginn;
    O chuireadh an sin ar n-√†r nior ghabh dhuinn c√¨s no c√†in,
    ‚ÄôUs ni robh aig duine cith ruinn ach far cuid de dh‚Äô iath an Eirinn,
    Iomadh bhi air feadh an domhain mhoir nach l√†thair bhi an deigh
     an t-sloidh,
    Ni faoin lamh air laimh a thuiteam le na ch√©ile,
    Da tig fiadhaich almharaich an sin orra ‚Äôan Eirinn iath-ghlan.
    Ossiain, creud a dheanadh Fionn, agus iarsma far an Eirinn?
    Air a laimh a chl√©irich chaidh, ni robh ‚Äôs a Bhanbha bh√†in,
    Beagan de laochraidh arsaidh agus oigridh gun dearbhadh;
    Ge b‚Äô e r√¨gh a sheasadh an sin gheabhadh se Fodla an nasgaidh,
    Gun chath, gun iorghuill, gun agh, gun on, gun achmhasan.
    Chuir sinn ar teachta saor gu f√†th Mac mhic Cuinn.
    Do chaidh uainn ‚Äôn ar cinn do ghabhail righre Eirinn,
    Mor an tigh sin d‚Äô imich oir bha r√¨gh Teamhra fa m√≤r toirm,
    Tuilleadh aobhar a tug gu dol a mharbhadh ar n-uile.
    Ossian, innis doibh sgeul ‚Äôn uair chuir sibh an iorghuill threun,
    ‚ÄôN uair thuit do mhac-sa ‚Äôs a chath, an do rug thu air a labhradh?
    Os cionn mo mhic Osgair aine th√†inig mis air cur an √†ir,
    Do thainig Caoilte air sin oscionn a sheachdnar cloinne,
    Thainig na robh be√≤ de ‚Äôr Feinn os cionn an cairdean fein,
    Droing dhiubh labhradar sin ‚Äôus bhi droing eile gun anamain.
    A chleirich a bhachuil bh√†in, ge bith do chitheadh an t-√†r,
    Bu mh√≤r an truaighe ri ‚Äôr linn uailse Eirinn do thuiteam.
    Iomadh cobhra codat caomh, iomadh luireach shitheach shaor
    Iomadh sgiath tharsna ‚Äôs a mhagh, agus a triath gun anamain,
    Cha dubhach sin do ‚Äôn t-sluaigh mar a b‚Äô √†l air an robh buaidh,
    Cha tug sinn leinn as a chath ach faoibh r√¨gh no ardlaoich.
    ‚ÄôS ann a fhuair mi mo mhac f√©in ‚Äôn luidhe air ‚Äôuilinn cl√¨,
    A sgiath ‚Äôn a bhris air an l√†r, agus a lann ‚Äôn a dheas laimh,
    De ‚Äôn fhuil aille air gach leth, d‚Äôiadh air blaghaibh a luirich,
    Leigeam earrlinn mo shleidh ri l√†r agus rinneas os a chionn t√†mh,
    Smuaineam a thailginn air sin creud a deanainn ‚Äôn a dheigh,
    Do thill Osgar riumsa suas agus bu le√≤r leam a chrois,
    Do sh√¨n e thugam a l√†mh air mhiann air mo ch√≤mhdhail,
    Do ghabh mi l√†mh mo mhic f√©in ‚Äôus do thugas r√†n cruaidh,
    ‚ÄôUs o an taobh sin a leth nior chuireas c√†s ‚Äôs an t-saoghal,
    Thubhairt riumsa mo mhac f√©in fear agus e an oir anamainn,
    Fo ris na d√πilibh sin do bhi-sa sl√†n a athair,
    Ni dheanaimse innseadh gh√≤, ni robh agam freagradh dha,
    Gu ‚Äôn tainig Caoilte m√≤r sin thugainn a dh‚Äô fhaicinn Osgar.
    A dubhairt Mac Ronain an aigh, ach cionnus tathas, a ghr√†idh;
    A tathaim ar‚Äô Osgar mar is dlighe ‚Äôdol an comhar saoghail aighe,
    Chreuchd sleadh Charbair ruaidh fa imlinn Osgair armruaidh,
    Lamh Chaoilte gu ‚Äôuilinn do rach an creuchdaibh na sleigh,
    Sireas Caoilte an cneadh air choir, do fhuair gach ni ‚Äôna dhoigh,
    Do fhuair a dhruim creuchta glan air a ghearradh le ‚Äôgheur shleadh.
    Sgreadas Mac Ronain an sin agus tuiteas gu talmhainn;
    Do thubhairt Caoilte am milidh treun air bhi dha air triall
          an dubh neul,
    F√¨rinn sin a Osgar ail a sgarras ri na Feinn,
    ‚ÄôUs sgaraidh cath ri Fiannaibh, bithidh an c√¨s aig siol m√≤r Chuinn.
    Goirid a bhi dhuinn mar sin a Mhic Alpain, a chl√©irich,
    Gu facadh thugainn o ‚Äôn √†r na robh be√≤ de Fhiannaibh Fail,
    Fichead ceud dhaoine mar sin eadar oigridh ‚Äôus √†rsaidh;
    Ni robh duine sl√†n diubh sin againn de ‚Äôn fhichead ceud sin,
    Ach fear naoi guine gu nimh, fath lugh aig gun de chreuchdadh.
    Togamar an t-Osgar arnaidh, air chrannaibh sleidh an √†irde,
    Beirminn e gu tulach ghrinn, do thabhairt dheth ‚Äô√©ideadh;
    Leud a bhoise dhe ‚Äôn chorp cha robh sl√†n o ‚Äôfholt,
    No gu ruig a bhuinn l√†r ach ‚Äôaghaidh ‚Äôn a h-aonaran;
    An inigh, ‚Äôs an d√πin, ‚Äôs an √†ra, geilleachdainn d‚Äôa chorp gu la,
    Gur thog sinn clann Mhic na Feinn, air chnocaibh ard aoibhinn,
    Nior chaoin neach a mhac f√©in, nior chaoin a bhr√†thair fa dheoigh,
    Ri faicsinn mo mhac-sa mar sin, c√†ch uile a caoineadh Osgair.
    Goirid a bin dhuinn mar sin, air curaidh a chuirp chaoimh ghil,
    Gu facadh thugain fa n√≤in, Fionn mac Cumhail mhic Threinmhoir.
    Gu tugsidear anns an √†r trian be√≤ de dh‚Äô Fhiannaibh Fail,
    Air faighail clanna Boisgne an iuir fa chaiseal chr√≤ ‚Äôs an iorghuil;
    Do bu ro bhacach na fir agus gr√†ineil na milidh;
    Gu faca sinn meirghe Fhinn, ri crann sleidh os ar cionn,
    Thugsaid thugainn as an √†r; do thug sinn ‚Äôn a comhdhail,
    Do bheannaich sinn uile dh‚Äô Fhinn agus char fhreagair e sinn,
    ‚ÄôDol air tulach nan treun, far an robh Osgar armgheur,
    ‚ÄôN uair a mhothaich Osgar Fionn air teachd da os a chionn,
    Togas an aghaidh neochlaon, ‚Äôus beannaicheas d‚Äô a sheanathair.
    A dubhairt an t-Osgar an sin, ri Mac Muirne ‚Äôs an uair sin,
    Mo chion feasd ris an eug air fhaicinn a Fhinn airmgheir,
    Truagh, a Osgair arnaidh a dheadh mhic mo mhic-sa fein,
    Mise air a dheigh is fann, ‚Äôus air deigh Feinn Eirinn,
    Mallachd ort a fhir co ‚Äôm buaidh ‚Äôs e is duibh thainig ri
          m‚Äô shluagh,
    Do lean e orm o shear, na gu rachadh mi an aonach,
    Sl√†n uam do iarghuil ‚Äôs do √†gh, slan do gach c√¨s a thogail,
    Slan do gach maith uam a nis, ach na faigheam de ‚Äôn chom so,
    Ri cl√†istinn caolmhuinn Fhinn, an arraing Osgar do ling,
    Do sh√¨n e uaith a dha l√†mh ‚Äôus do dh‚Äô iath a rosg roinnbhlath.
    Do thionndadh Fionn ruinn a ch√πl, do shileadh dheur gu d√πr;
    Ach fa Osgar ‚Äôus fa Bhran, cha d‚Äô rinn se deur air talmhainn,
    Ach mise mhain agus Fionn ni robh de dh‚Äô Fheinn os a chionn,
    Thug iad tri gh√†ir ‚Äôs an uair, a chlos fa Eirinn aghmhor.
    Cuig fichead ceud, deich ‚Äôus deich ceud air an comhaireimh
          dhinn f√©in,
    Bha de ‚Äôn Fheinn marbh air a mhagh, gun aon duine dheth easbhuidh,
    A dha √πrdail sin ‚Äôus ni g√≤ ‚Äôus R√¨gh Eirinn sgeul fa mo,
    Bha marbh air an taobh eile, do shluagh Eirinn arm-ghrinn,
    Ni robh Fionn suilbhir no seimh, o sin gu theachd a bh√†is;
    O ‚Äôn ghle√≤ sin ni fearda leis, righrean bhi a dh√¨th fearainn.
    O ‚Äôn chath sin cath Ghabhra nocha d‚Äô rinn mi treun labhradh,
    Cha robh an uair riamh no lo, nar leig mi osnadh lan mh√≤r.
                                                      M√≤r an nochd.

    Cha mhair Osgar ionmhuinn, thug m√≤r chosgar chalma,
    Cha mhair seachd mhic Chaoilte, no gasraidh Fiann Almhuin,

    No ruith buinne srutha, no Osgar ‚Äôs a chath sin.
    Bha se mu dheireadh, mar dhuille ri treun ghaoith,

Gillecallum Mac an Ollaimh an t-ursgeul so sios.

    Do chuala mi fad o shean, sgeul do bhuineas ri cumha,
    Is tr√†th dha ‚Äôaithris gu trom, ge ta mar ainneas oirnne,
    Clann Rughraidh nam breth mall fa Chonchoir ‚Äôus fa Chonnuil,
    Do b‚Äô√πrlaimh oig-fhir ‚Äôs a mhagh air h-urlar Choige Ullaidh,
    G‚Äôa thigh na thainig le gean fa uile laochraidh Bhanbha,
    Cath aig faighail aon uair eile, de ‚Äôr dh‚Äô iomghuin clanna
          R√πghraidh.
    Thainig thugainn, borb a fhraoch, an curaidh crodha Conlaoch,
    A dh‚Äô fhios ni m ‚Äôar claraibh grinn, o Dhunsgathaich gu Eirinn.
    Do labhair Conchoir ri c√†ch, Co a gheibheamar thun an oglaich,
    Do bhreth beachd no sgeul dheth, gun teachd le euradh uaith?
    Gluaiseas Conull nior lag lamh do bhreth sgeul de ‚Äôn mhacan.
    Air dearbhadh tarruing do‚Äôn laoch ceangailear Conull le Conlaoch,
    Nior ghabh an laoch r‚Äôa tamhachd, Conlaoch fraochach furanach,
    Ceud de‚Äôr sluagh do cheangladh leis, ioghnadh ‚Äôus buan ri aithris.
    Cuirear teachdair gu ceann nan con o h-ardrigh eagnaidh Ullaidh,
    Gu Dundealgain grianach glan seann d√πn ciallach nan Gaidheal,
    O‚Äôn d√πn sin do leughar leinn do dh‚Äô eangnamh nighean Fhorgainn.

    Am macan gun d‚Äô fhuair a ghuin, an daltan cruaidh lamhach.
    Cuchullain is comhrag cruaidh do bhi an la sin fo dhiombuaidh,
    A aon mhac do mharbhadh leis, an t-saor shlat chalm chaomhghlas.
    Innis duinn ars‚Äô c√π nan cleas o tathas feasd fo ‚Äôr n-ailleas,
    D‚Äô ainm ‚Äôus do shloinneadh gu lom na teirig a dh‚Äô fholchainn oirnne.
    Is mi Conlaoch mac na con oighre dligheach Dhuin dealgain,
    Is mi an r√πn d‚Äô fhagas ‚Äôam broinn ‚Äôus tu aig Sgiath ‚Äôg ad fhoghlum,

    Na cleasa le ‚Äôr thorchair mi bha dh‚Äô easbhuidh an fhoghluim orm.
    Smuaineas Cuchulain ‚Äôn uair a dh‚Äô eug, a mhac an dreach do chumhadh,
    Gur smuain, ni breug, faoilte an fhir, do threig a chuimhne ‚Äôs
          a cheudfaidh,
    A urram ri corp na Con a chumha is beag nach do sgar,

    Caorthainn do bhi air Loch Maoibh do chimid an traigh do dheas,
    Gach a r√© ‚Äôus gach a mios toradh abuich do bhi air.
    Seasamh bha an caora sin, fa millse no mil a bhl√†th,
    Do chumadh a caoran dearg fear gun bhiadh gu ceann naoi tr√†th,
    Bliadhna air shaoghal gach fir do chuir sin is sgeul dearbh,
    Gu ‚Äôm b‚Äô fhoirinn do luchd chneidh br√¨gh a mheas ‚Äôus e dearg.

    Bhitheann an euslaint throm, throm, nighean Athaich nan corn saor,
    Do chuireadh leath fios air Fraoch; dh‚Äô fhiosraich ciod ‚Äôth√†inig
          rithe.
    A dubhairt Maoibh nach bitheadh sl√†n mar bitheadh l√†n a boise
          maoith,
    De chaoraibh an Loch fhuair, gun duine g‚Äôa bhuain ach Fraoch.
    Cnuasachd riamh nior dheanadh mi ars‚Äô mac Fithich nan gruaidh
          dearga,
    Ge gur dheanas e air Fraoch racham do bhuain caor do Mhaoibh.
    Gluaiseas Fraoch fa fear an √†igh uainn gu sn√†mh air an Loch,
    Fhuair e a bheisd ‚Äôus i ‚Äôn a suain us a ceann suas ris an
          dos. Osnadh.
    Fraoch mac Fithich nan arm geur, thainig o ‚Äôn Bh√©isd gun fhios d‚Äôi,
    Thug e ultach de chaora dearg far an robh Maoibh dh‚Äô a ti.
    Ach ge maith na thugas leat, a dubhairt Maoibh is geal cruth,
    Ni fhoghain dhomhsa, laoich luinn, ach slat a bhuain as a bhun.
    Togras Fraoch is nior gille tioma sn√†mh a r√¨s air an linn bhog,
    ‚ÄôUs nior fhaod e ge mor ‚Äôagh, theachd o ‚Äôn bh√†s ‚Äôs an robh a chuid,
    Gabhas an caorthuinn air bh√†rr, tarruingidh an crann as a fhreumh,
    Toirt a chosan dha air t√¨r mosglas da suas a Bh√©isd.
    Beireas air ‚Äôus e air sn√†mh ‚Äôus gabhas a l√†mh ‚Äôn a craos,
    Do ghabh esan ise air ghial, truagh gun a scian bhi aig Fraoch.
    Ainnir an fhuilt chaise aille do rainig thuige le sgian de ‚Äôn √≤ir,
    Leadair a bh√©isd a chneas b√†n ‚Äôus teasgadh a lamh air luath.
    Do thuiteadar bonn ri bonn air traigh nan clacha corr fa dheas,
    Fraoch mac Fithich ‚Äôus a bh√©isd truagh a Dh√© mar thug an treis.
    Ge comhrag ni comhrag gearr do rug leis a ceann ‚Äôn a laimh,
    Mar chunnaic an nighean e do chaidh i ‚Äôn a neul air an traigh,
    Eireas an nighean o ‚Äôn t√†mh gabhas an l√†mh bu l√†mh bog.
    Ge ta so ‚Äôn a chuid nan eun, is m√≤r an t-euchd a rinn a bhos,
    O ‚Äôn bh√†s sin do fhuair am fear, Loch Maoibh do lean air an loch,
    A ta an t-ainm d‚Äôi gu luain ‚Äôg a ghairm a nuas gus a nis. Osnadh.
    Beirear an sin gu Cluain Fraoich corp an laoich gu caiseal chr√≤,
    Air a ghleann thug e ainm, is mairg a mhaireas da √©is be√≤.
    Carn Laimh an carn so ri ‚Äôm thaobh is laimh rithe do bhitheas sona,
    Fear nior iompaich an treise, fear a b‚Äô annsa neart an trod.
    Ionmhuinn beul nar ob daimh do m‚Äô bitheadh mnathan a tabhairt ph√≤g,
    Ionmhuinn tighearn nan sluagh, ionmhuinn gruaidh nar deirge an r√≤s,
    Duibhe no fiach barr a fhuilt, deirge a ghruaidh no fuil laoich,
    Bu mhine no cobhar srutha, gile no sneachd cneas Fhraoich,
    Caise no an caisein ‚Äôfholt, guirme a rosg na oidhre leac,
    Deirge no partan a bheul, gile a dheud no bl√†th fiodh,
    Ard a shleagh mar chrann si√πil, binne no teud ciuil a ghuth,
    Snamhaiche a b ‚Äôfhearr no Fraoch, cha do sh√¨n a thaobh ri sruth,
    Bu leathainn no comhla a sgiath, ionmhuinn tr√†th bhith ri druim,
    Bu chomhfhad a lamh ‚Äôus a lann, leathainn a cholg no clar luinge,
    Truagh nach b‚Äôann ‚Äôan comhrag ri laoch do thuit Fraoch a
          bhronnadh oir,
    Tuirse sin a thuiteam le B√©isd, truagh a Dhe nach mairionn f√≤s.
                                                          Osnadh.

Is e √πghdair so Conull cearnach Mac Edarscoil.

    A Chonuill, cha sealbh na cinn, deimhin leam gur dheargas d‚Äôairm,
    Na cinn do chi‚Äôm air a ghad sloinntear leat na fir fo fhaoibh.
    A nighean Fhorghuil nan each, A Eimhear oige na brigh binn,
    Is ann an √©iric Chon nan cleas, thugas leam an nios na cinn.
    Co an ceann mullach donn m√≤r, deirge no‚Äôn r√≤s a ghruaidh glan,
    Is e a ‚Äôs goire do ‚Äôn leth chl√¨ an ceann diubh nach
          d‚Äôatharraich dath?
    Ceann r√¨gh mi nan each luath, ars‚Äô Mac Cairbair nan goith cam;
    An √©iric mo dhaltan f√©in thugas leam an cein an ceann.
    Co an ceann ud air m‚Äô aghaidh thall, co folt fann gu mall sliom,
    Rosg mar fheur, deud mar bhl√†th, ailde no gach cruth a cheann?
    Manadh b‚Äôe fear nan each, Mac an Aoife do chreachadh gach cuan,
    Do fh√†gas a choluinn gun cheann ‚Äôus do thuit uile leam a shluagh.
    Co an ceann so ghabhas tu a‚Äôd laimh a Chonuill mh√≤ir nam b√†igh linn,
    O nach marrainn Cu nan cleas ciod bheireadh tu air leas a chinn?
    Ceann mac Fherghuis nan each, bheireadh e cith gach gurt,
    Mac mo pheathar an tur sheang do sgaras a cheann r‚Äôa chorp.
    Co an ceann ud shear an fhuilt fhinn d‚Äô an greadadh na cinn
          gu ‚Äôl√†imh,
    Fhuaireas aithne air a ghuth gun robhadar seal d‚Äôa reir?
    Sios an sud do thuit an Cu do rad a chorp fo bhr√π deas,
    Cu mac coin r gh nan rann thugas leam a cheann tar √©is.
    Co an da cheann so is faide mach a Chonuill mhoir a bhreth bu bhinn,
    Air ghr√†dh teann na ceil oirnn ainm nam fear a ghuin na h-airm?
    Ceann Laoghaire ‚Äôus clar Chuilt an da cheann do thuit le‚Äôm ghuin,
    Do ghuin sud Cuchullin ceairn, sonn dheargas m‚Äôairm ‚Äôn a fhuil.
    Co an da cheann so is faide soir, a Chonuill mhoir gach geal

    Co na s√© cinn so is olc m√©in do chitheam f√©in air m‚Äô aghaidh thuath,

    Is iad sud an seisir laoich a thuit leam ‚Äôs an airm ‚Äômo laimh.

    A Eimhear is e so a cheud, ardr√¨gh Laighein nan lann breac.
    A Chonuill mh√≤ir, m√πgh an sgeul, creud a thuit le‚Äôd laimh gun lochd,
    De ‚Äôn t-sluaigh eagnaidh a bheil sin a dioltas cinn na Con?
    Deichnear ‚Äôus seachd fichead ceud deiream f√©in is aireamh sluaigh,
    Do thuit leamsa druim air dhruim, do nimh mo cholg conla rag,
    A Chonuill, cionnus taid mnathan Innsefail an deigh na Con,
    Cumha a mhic shamhailt tha na bheil aca f√©in air foir?
    A Eimhear ciod a dheanadh mi gun mo Chu a ‚Äôm reir s‚Äô an Soc
    Gun mo dhaltan fa maith cruth a dol uam ‚Äôam mugh an nochd,
    A Chonuill tog mi ‚Äôs an fheart, tog mo leac os leac na Con,
    Os d‚Äôa chumhadh rachaim eug, cuir mo bheul ri beul na Con.
    Is mi Eimhear is caoine dealbh, ni faigheam searbh dioltadh dhomh,
    Do dheur nocha n ‚Äôeil mo speis, truagh m‚Äô fhuireach air √©is a Chon.
                                                            A Chonuill.

Is e √πghdair so Caoilte Mac Ronain.

    Chaidheam tosg a dh‚Äô fhuasgladh Fhinn, gu Teamhra nan sreabh
          aoibhinn,
    Go h-airm a ‚Äôm faighear‚Äô bh√≤rrshlat mhear, gu Cormaig Mac Airt
          aoin fhir,
    Nior chleachd mi maidheamh mo ghlonn ger fuileach fior eutrom,
    Gu bheildeis Fianna Fail os bhord Locha Feabhuil.
    Mharbhamair an laoch l√†n, mar a mharbhamair an Cuireach,
    Do chearbmasdair laoch fa liach, mar a chearbsamair an triath,
    Thugsamair ceann gun choire, gus a chnoc os Buadhamair.
    Do rinneas f√©in buaidh tr√†th, do rinneas f√≤gradh ullamh,
    Do mharbhais mun fhear ghrinn fear gach aon bhaile an Eirinn.
    Do rinneas buaidh tr√†th do rinneas f√≤gradh ullamh,
    Do radas mu‚Äôn fhear ghrinn gul gach aon tigh ‚Äôan Eirinn,
    Do rinneas buaidh tr√†th do rinneas f√≤gradh ullamh.
    Na laoigh do leigeann fa buaibh do bhitheas an Eirinn aghmhor.
    Do rinneas buaidh tr√†th do rinneas f√≤gradh ullamh.
    Na dorsan air am bitheadh a ghaoth dhearg do fhosglann iad

    Na guirt abuich mu thalmhainn, do loisgeann iad gu lasail.
    Do rinneas buaidh tr√†th, do rinneas f√≤gradh ullamh.
    Noch char fhaiceas ri ‚Äôm linn √†th no muileann an Eirinn.
    An sin do leigeadar rium eich Albainn ‚Äôus Eirinn;
    Teighim be√≤ air luathas mo choise gur rainigeas Ros Iolair ghlais,
    An sin gluaiseamsa siar gu Teamhra an fhidireachdainn,
    Nior the√†ruinn aon each dhiubh dhe, romham in Teamhra do esan.
    Tugas in Teamhra fa leth, bean an fhir choma dh‚Äô a ch√©ile,
    ‚ÄôUs bean an fhir choma so gun achd gus an fhear choma so eile.
    Tugas an Teamhra gu beachd bean Chairbair do Chormaig,
    ‚ÄôUs bean Chormaig an sin do radais i do Charbair.
    Tugas leam claidheamh an R√¨gh, Och! fa h-e m√≤r a bhr√¨gh,

An t-√πghdair so----.

    La dh‚Äô an deachaidh Fionn a dh‚Äô ol, an Almha ‚Äôus nior iomadh
          sluaigh,
    Seisir bhan ‚Äôus seisir fhear inghin gheal ‚Äôus ainnir uchd-gheal,
    Fionn f√©in ‚Äôus Diarmad gun on Caoilte ‚Äôus Oisian ‚Äôus Osgar,
    Conan maol gu mall air magh, agus mnathan nan s√© laoch sin,
    Maigheaneas bean Fhinn bu dein, ‚Äôus ainnir uchd-gheal mo bhean f√©in,
    Gormlaidh aoile is dubha rosg, Naoimh ‚Äôus nighean Aonghuis.
    ‚ÄôN uair a ghabh misge na mnathan, tugsadar an cuis r√©idh,
    Nach robh air an domhain t√¨ seisir bhan ann cho ionraic,
    A dubhairt an innilt gun on is tulach cearnach an domhain,
    Ge maith sibhse is iomadh bean nach d‚Äô rinn fios ach ri aon fhear.
    Goirid air bhi dhoibh mar sin thainig a bhean d‚Äô ar rochdain;
    Aon bhrat uimpe gun alt agus e ‚Äôn a aon fheadh,
    Thainig nighean a bhrat fhinn am fianuis Mhic Cumhail,
    Beannaicheas do ‚Äôn r√¨gh gun on agus suidheas ‚Äôn a fhaireadh,
    Fe√≤raicheas Fionn sgeul dhith, de ‚Äôn nighinn l√πthor lamhghil,
    A bhean a bhrat gun alt ciod a rad tu as d‚Äô aon fheadh?
    Is geas do ‚Äôm bhrat gun alt bean ann ach ‚Äôn a aon √≤igh
    Noch cha-n fhaigh dion fo ‚Äôm bhrat ach bean an fhir gun ro lochd.
    Tabhair am brat do ‚Äôm mhnaoi f√©in a deir Conan m√≤r gun ch√©ill,
    Gun √©isdeamaid am briathar mear, a thug na mnathan a chianaimh,
    Gabhas bean Chonain am brat, a chuireas uimpe le rachd,
    Gum b‚Äôe sin an luath lochd, ‚Äôn uair leig ris uile a geal uchd.
    Mar a chunnaic Conan maol, am brat air casadh f‚Äôa taobh,
    Gabhas a chraoiseach gu nimh, agus marbhas an nighean,
    Gabhas bean Dhiarmaid a ghaoil, am brat o mhnaoi Chonain mhaoil,
    Noch char fearr a bhasa dhith, casaidh am brat f‚Äôa ciabh.
    Gabhas bean Osgair ‚Äôn a d√©igh, am brat co fhada caomh r√©idh,
    Ge leobhar sgiath am brat fionn, noch char fholaich a h-imlinn,
    Gabhas Maigheanas gu h-aille, am brat ‚Äôus do chuireas f‚Äôa ceann,
    Do chas us do chuair mar sin, am brat gu luath f‚Äôa cluaisibh.
    Tabhair am brat ars‚Äô Mac Reith, do ‚Äôm mhnaoi-sa ni cuis cleith,
    Gu √©isdeamaid a nis gun on, treis eile d‚Äôa h-iomlaid domh.
    Do bheirinnse briathar ris, agus ni briathar eigis,
    Nach dearnas de fhios ri fear, ach dol duitse an aois leinibh,
    Nochdas bean Mhic Reith a taobh, cuireas umpa am brat fionn,
    A soigh eadar chos ‚Äôus l√†mh, na gu leth air a luideinean,
    Aon ph√≤g d‚Äô fhuaireas am braghad o Mhac O‚ÄôDhuine, Diarmad.
    Do ruitheas am brat o um l√†r mar bhi si ‚Äôn a h-aonaran.
    Tabhraibh mo bhrat domh a mhnathan, is mi nighean an Deirg ghraine,
    Noch cha dearnas de lochd, ach fios ri Fionn faobhar nochta.
    Beir mo mhallachd ‚Äôus imich uainn, is e deir Mac Cumhail gom buaidh,
    A d‚Äô fhagas f‚Äôa mhallachd air mnathaibh, na d‚Äô eiridhse
          thugainn aon la.
                                                                Aon la.

    Cuid de‚Äôn imeachd cha cheileam, ged nach bheileam gu calma,
    Osgar ‚Äôus Caoilte crodha ‚Äôus Mac Lughaidh a mholtar,
    Fionn agus Diarmad deudgheal, cuigear laoich de‚Äôn n-ochdar.
    Mise agus Raoine ‚Äôus Caruil, caomh an fhoruinn gun lochda,
    Chinneamar air chrich Bhanbha, gur b‚Äôe ainmean an ocbdar.
    Imeachd oirnne, sgeul dearbh, fhine gu calm fo‚Äôn sotal,

    Thugamar cath ‚Äôs an Eadailt, do bhreth teagbhoil ‚Äôn a portaibh,
    Rugamar buaidh ‚Äôus cumha, cuimhne leam imeachd ochdar.
    Thugamar cath na Frainge o ‚Äôs ann do bhreth gu docair,
    Ghabhamar geill ‚Äôus cumha, cuimhne leam imeachd ochdar.
    Thugamar cath na Spainn, a taintean ‚Äôus a tachdaran,
    Chaidhear mo r√© fa ‚Äôn domhain, cuimhne leam imeachd ochdar.
    Thogamar cath Bhreatuin, b‚Äôeagalach e ‚Äôus bu dhocair,
    Thogamar geall daoine, cuimhne leam imeachd ochdar.
    Bheireamar Crom nan cam air fairge ‚Äôus e air oiteal,
    Fhuaireamar gach tir umhal, cuimhne leam imeachd ochdar.
    ‚ÄôN a dheigh thainig na toisich, a Phadruig uasail thochdmhuin,
    Fionn gheibheadh air cumha, cuimhne leam imeachd ochdar.
    Naomhaich m‚Äôanamasa a Phadruig, is airde cruth us sochair,
    O pheacaich mise a‚Äôd chomhar, cuimhne leam imeachd ochdar.
                                                  Cuimhne leam.

    Nimheach dhomh an d√†n, da an tuig cach sud,
    Na leig a Mhic Dh√©, mi ‚Äôs a ph√©in an diugh.
    Beag a shaoil an sgoil, mo dh√†n a dhol fo bhinn
    An d√†n tarladh ruinn, is si do mhill mi,
    Is mo a bheil de ‚Äôm ghaoth, ris fa thri na i,
    A teugbhail dubh dhomh, do bhi cloch ‚Äôna sgeith.
    Air bhean an d√†in tiom, is mor m‚Äôfhioch ‚Äôus m‚Äôfhearg,
    Cneas mar chobhar tonn, glac chorr is deirge.
    Beul air dath nan s√πgh, tug mo chruth air soirthe,
    O‚Äôd chodladsa an raoir, truagh a Dh√© mo chor.
    Do bhi si far rium, air leam gun g√†ire robh,
    Gun i ann o l√≤, do chaidh air bhr√≤n domh.
    Duibh na fitheach a cul, ruis is trom a r√†dh,
    Coig fleasg ‚Äôn an snaim, a ta an ainm na mnath.
    Truagh gun i fo ‚Äôm bhreith, air a breith o chach,
    Da fhaighinnse f√©in, gu ri‚Äôr fhuair an daimh.
    Sleagh Chonchulain charna, each Taoigh an eich bhain,
    Sgiath chorcrach gun gh√†ig, fa maith h-iad air chath,
    Siubhal eich Mhic Eirc, ge mor sin ri r√†dh,
    Och is mo fa r√©ir, mo ghaoth ris an d√†n.


Duncha Mac Phearsoin.

    Alastair, an do threig thu a ghruaim, no am faod sibh a cur uaith
          air l√†r,
    An d‚Äôfhan sibh am bliadhna gun Dhia, no ‚Äôm bi sibh mar sin gu br√†th,
    Chaoidh ni ‚Äôn d‚Äôfhuaireas do ghean, o ta tu gu sean liath,
    Ma ‚Äôs ann air gruaim a bhitheas an rath, is m√≤r a fhuair thu a
          mhaith o Dhia.
    Ceathrar bhi air uaigh an fhir, air feart Alastair uaibhrich,
    Do chansaid briathra gun bhr√©ig, os cionn an fhlatha Fionnghr√©ige.
    Dubhairt an ceud fhear dhiubh, do bhitheamar an d√© fa ‚Äôn r√¨gh,
    Sluagh an domhain, truagh an d√†il, ge a ta an diugh ‚Äôna aonar√†n.
    Do bhi an d√© r√¨gh an domhain duinn, ‚Äôn a mhareach air talmhainn
          truime,
    Gur e an talamh a ta an diugh, ‚Äôn a mharcach air a mhunsan.
    A dubhairt an treas ughdair glic, bhi am bith an d√© aig Mac Philip,
    An diugh aige nocha ‚Äôn ‚Äôeil, ach seachd troidh dhe ‚Äôn talmhainn.
    Alastair muirneach m√≤r, Alastair thasgadh airgiod ‚Äôus √≤r,
    An diugh ars‚Äô an ceathramh fear, a ta an t-√≤r ‚Äôg a thasgadhsa.
    Mac Philip a phailm os chrannaibh, an r√© os na reultanaibh,
    An t-√≤r os na seudaibh sl√†n, am mial mor os na bradanaibh.
    An leoghan os chairbhe gun bhlagh, am fireun os na h‚Äôeunlaith,
    Sliabh Shioin os gach sliabh sl√†n, os gach sruth sruth Iordain.
    An leug liomharra os na clachaibh, a mhuir os na m√¨nshruthaibh,
    Sonmharach am fear gun on, aon fhear os fearaibh talmhainn.
    Aon fhear os fearaibh talmhainn ach r√¨gh neimh is neo thalmhaidh,
    R√¨gh tinne nan treud‚Äôs nan torc, ceann nan ceud ‚Äôs nan garaidh.
    C√≤mhradh nan ughdair a b ‚Äôfhior, air teachd air h-uaigh an airdrigh,
    Ni cosmhuil ri baothghloir bhan, a‚Äôr chansadar an ceathrar.
                                                            Ceathrar.

Is e √πghdair so Dunchadh Mac Caibe.

    A Mhic Dhughail a d‚Äô√πr achdmhuinn, do luath laoch a chlannmhacan,
    Tha mo dhearbhachdainn fior mu ‚Äôn dhealbh mhacan mhoir bhrigh,
    Is fearr thig do cheannsa chaomh, bhi ris na dhomhsa a mhacaimh,
    Dunchadh carrach ‚Äôg a ghairm da, is ainm dha a b‚Äôfhearr buaidh.
    A Dhunchaidh nan corr gaisge, cuimhnich ainm do cheud bhaisde,
    A Mhic Allain na toill f√©in, toibheum noch char fhuair an linn,
    O ta se nis an aithne na h-uile aobhar ard bhlagh,
    Gu bhi an ceud fhuair t√πs an arois, o ‚Äôs tu eudail gu thathas.
    Deimhin gur a tu r√¨s, fear ghabhail nan garbh ch√¨s,
    Mar tharbh trod agus t√†chair, is dearbh do thogar an cathach.
    Is tu tasdaileach Chruachain, a sealg sleidh fo‚Äô bruachan,
    Do chli√π onchoin ‚Äôg a innseadh, is tu Dunchadh Diurinnse.
    Is tu choisgeas do namh, is tu dheargas do dha lamh,
    Is tu dh‚Äô fhoireas o‚Äôr sgios sinn, is tu r√¨s d‚Äôaoibhneas againn.
    Is se fear do ‚Äôm b‚Äô usa, a rinn do luaidh cho musa,
    Do nitheam eadar laoich mar sin, do ‚Äôn dreagon chaomh o‚Äôn Chonuil,
    A taid aige de bhuaidh air, ceaird eile na chuilbhr.
    Gaisge agus eincach Eirinn, ga ‚Äôn nasgadh ‚Äôn a luath bheuman,
    Gach innleachd ghleidheas mac R√¨gh, a ta iad aig gun aineimh.
    A ghloir gheal ghlan ris ‚Äôg a reic, le ‚Äôr do √©irich an deagh mhac.
    O chitheam gu bheil a toirt c√¨s, leat as gach aon bhaile,
    R√¨gh aireach aig gniomh ghrinn, a teachd um chraoibh chosgair.
                                                          A mhic.

Is e √πghdair so, Eoin Mac Eoghain Mhic Eachairn.

    Deurach sian air siol Chuinn, ni eireach an dochainn,
    In deigh Eoin doibh a dhol, s√¨th ‚Äôn a uaigh noch cha deantar,
    An sian fa robhadar riamh, fine Chuinn nior chleachd dimhiodh,
    In deigh Eoin gach fear air gul, da uaigh nior ann gun iompaidh.
    Da ‚Äôbh√†s do thruagh an t√¨r, Mac fhir a ghin o Allan.
    M√≤r ar sian air gul do chor, nior lion duine nach gu deurach,
    An cor sin le‚Äôr olc dhuinn, b√†s Eoin is truagh an torunn.
    Thainig brath o Dh√πn do ‚Äôn chor, fa chuing ch√†ch do chaidhidear,
    Saoghal caochlaideach dhomhsa gu h-eug Eoin, nior eireadar
     gu aintre√≤ir.
    Fagas l√†n do sh√¨ol o shean, an sian na an doibh a dhochainn,
    Aobhar‚Äôm broin a bhi mar sin, clann Dughail do dh√¨th an fhir.
    Chaidh barn nan sian r√© seal, searbh an sgeul ri sgeulachadh,
    A theachdair a thug an sgeul, thugain a Dh√© do dhroch dh√†il.
    Na sgeul do labhairt leibh, m‚Äôamhra nior chaill an cluasan,
    Saordhail mo gheire troimh chl√©ibh uile, do bhuin diom roinn
     mo fhradarc.
    An deigh Eoin ni anmhuinn a ghul, cha-n fhaigheam deoir ri dheanamh,
    Tuireadh air an Fhian ‚Äôs an uaigh, b√†s Mhic Dhughaill Dhunollaimh.
    Ann a aghaidh fa chruth Chuinn, nior ghile cno ri cruinne,
    ‚ÄôS aon bhorb bhriseadh no bhith, m√®in a chuain ‚Äôga chaoineadh.
    Air ard an traigh air eug Eoin, nior fhaighead alt o‚Äôn athair,
    Luaidh air aoibhneas noch cha-n ‚Äôaill, ‚Äôn deigh Eoin iomghain.
    Na sloigh ‚Äôg am breith de bhr√≤n, gun luaidh air creach no air c√≤r,
    A deir ris an rathad caidh, a teachd o d‚Äô uaigh gus an traigh,
    Le tuireadh an dochainn null, do‚Äôd chumhadh a b‚Äôfhear banchaire.
    An tig m‚Äôonoir o‚Äôd fholt bog, lochd agam ‚Äôn a ionad,
    Bhi air ‚Äôfheart fa dheurach domh, sgiamhalach mo dhearc a ghabh.
    Ni fhaotaid mnathan dol dh√¨, o d‚Äô uaigh le truime an tuirse,
    Togaibh feart do ‚Äôn Fhian bh√†n, leud laga chille Chruachain.
    Gu ‚Äôr gur aithnichte e orra, do bh√†s a leth leatroma,
    Fine do‚Äôd chumha go an g√†ir, dubh an cr√© ni codalaid.
    A chloinn Dughail gu eug Eoin, ni dheanadh neach fear namh dhoibh,
    Thainig do bh√†s fhir mhullaich seimh, noch ch√†s a cheannsachaidh.
    Air uaigh Eoin ni ainnidh mnathan, a dortadh dheur gach aon la,
    C√†il bhan ag eiridh tr√†th dhoibh, troidh air mhagh gun bharran.
    Ni h-ioghnadh dhoibh tuirse throm, an deigh Eoin do gheal urram,
    Ni ‚Äôn tig la nach lion cridhe, an sgeul fa ta ar tuirsene.
    Coma leam ge leo sin, creud a dheanadh do leisg leam,
    D‚Äôa bh√†s nocha socair sinn, deacair an c√†s ‚Äôna ‚Äôr chuireann.
    A‚Äôm sheasamh tha melgthamh air, gun luaidh air laoidh a ghabhar,
    Thug cridhe dhomh ‚Äôn a dha leth, sinn a luaidh air fhalbhaich.
    Cha d‚Äôrinneadh riamh roimh sin, doighe dhuinn dhol d‚Äôa fharraid,
    Is aobhar br√≤in gun e ann, is doighe mi o nach marrainn.
    D‚Äô√®is e chodladh na uaigh fhuair, mar tha an tir, truagh an toirm,
    Traigheadh air deoir noch cha-n eil, saoth an D√πin ‚Äôs an duthaich.
    L√†n mara ‚Äôteachd thar tulchaibh, air n-eug Eoin ‚Äôs da choghairibh,
    Onfhadh air an fhairg ni bheil, air ard chuan fa Chonnuill.
    Do chumha och! r√¨gh rathaich Chuinn, ‚Äôs a chrioch so chloinn
          Dughaill,
    Blath gal a‚Äôd dheigh air d√πthaich, bithidh ri h-√©igh gon eugchruas.
    Aois chiuil um cliath Dhughaill, a eigse ‚Äôs a ollamhan;
    Leachd air teachd air uaigh Eoin, eachdair a bhi de ‚Äôn aindeoin.
    Fad an iontadh Neill, do chaidh gach cuis toibheim,
    Nach sp√©is doibh an uaigh, dhol d‚Äô√©is Eoin an iontadh.
    Teirc a fhuaireadh aicme Chuinn, o‚Äôn la nach mair Mac Dhughaill,
    Br√¨gh an fhiodhuill nocha n-‚Äôeil, scriobhadh fhilidh ‚Äôn a easbhuidh.
    Onoir an fhileadh ni bhi, air teasdail do Mhac Mairidh,
    Is beag am beul daimheil d‚Äôi, do radh a h-onoir bhuadhach.
    Na gun deachaidh druim air dhruim, uam dha cheann chloinn Dughaill,
    Ri treoir Eoin ni fhaghail domh, an deigh Eoin ‚Äôathair.
    Gu gleidheadh Dia do dhealbh niamh, do fhuair innleachd an oide
          Ilich,
    O eachraidh nocha bhitheann buaidh, dha deachaidh uath ‚Äôus imeachd.
    An deigh an triur truagh an t-olc, mo chridhe ni fhuair furtachd,
    Truagh nan oige go ch√†s do chitheam, de bh√†s da Eoin ‚Äôus Alastair.
    Alastair nach gabhann geis an trath mu ‚Äôn tigear thairis,
    D‚Äôuchd air stuagh bhuaine br√¨gh do thruaill och! mo nimhe.
    Ni bhith ‚Äôg a iarraidh air dul d‚Äô oighre Eoin gu iorghuil,
    A bhith air tir na troda, ni bhith nach fa‚Äôn uaigh fhada.

    Seabhag deud gheal nan tri ghleann, leis an leughar goil gach

    Padruig athair, aithne dhuit, Maolcholuim athair Phadruig,
    Mac Eoin duibh na ‚Äôr dhubh br√†igh, dligheach a chuire ‚Äôs a
          chreadradh,
    Eoin eile athair Eoin duibh, Mhic Grigoir, Mhic Eoin aghmhoir,
    Ta triar feara fa feile, triar teamhaireach mu thromchleir,
    Athair an Eoin sin oileanaich, Maolcholuim na ‚Äôr cheil a n√¨,
    Mac Dhunchaidh mhuiginir bhig reim, onchoin air nach tig toibheum.
    Dunchadh eile athair-san Mac Gillfhaolain oirchill,
    Do shaor leat ‚Äôn uair dh‚Äô fhoir ri daimh, Mac Aoidh √πr o Urchaidh.
    Ceanan nan corr gatha, athair Aoidh Urchaidh,
    O Alpain a gharg mh√®in ghlan, ardrigh nam balg bheum brioghmhor.
    So an ceathramh tuaraisg a‚Äôs tug, umad a oighre Phadruig,
    Cuimhnich ceart bheil fa‚Äôd chaomh, dream o Alpain oighre Dhughaill,
    Fear air fhichead is tu fh√©in, Eoin dubh nach dubh cr√©,
    Do cheart sheanchas is e sin, gu Fearghus Mac Eirc aghmhoir.
    A‚Äôd chinneadh nach crion ri fodhair, s√© linn do ghabh coron,
    Da fhichead agus triur r√¨gh, dlighear an fhuil ‚Äôs an ardfhreumh,
    Tri tuathruidh, tri deasruidh, an deigh Mhaolcholuim Chinnmhoir,
    Da choigear choron a chinnidh, o Mhaolcholum gu Alpain,
    O Alpain suas is e bhitheas, ceithir deug fir gu Ferghus,
    Do cheart sheanchas is e sin, gu Fearghus Mac Eirc aghmhoir.
    Cia lion de sheanchas mar sin, riamh gu Ferghus faighidir,
    Iomadh fine oll fa d‚Äôfhuil tathas, nach √†ireamar n‚Äôuair √†irmheas,
    Do bu sg√¨th sgoil d‚Äô an sgeulaibh, gach r√¨gh a bheil fa d‚Äô√πr

    Fuil Artuir fa d‚Äô urla fann, maith do chuid ‚Äôdo chuislean;
    Fuil Chuain, fuil Chuinn fa‚Äôd chneas, da shuthain sothrain n‚Äôfhine,

                                                            Aithris.

Is e √πghdair so am bard ruadh Fionnladh.

    Theasd aon diabhul nan Gaidheal, sgeul is coir a chuimhneach,
    Bha ri daor lot chille is chroise, maol torc mall gun mheas;
    A ifrionn thainig air t√πs, usaide an sgeul iombus,
    Mar tha bhi ris air ball, an gathaibh ghreas an diabhuil.
    Do nasgaidear air faraon ‚Äôn uair a dh‚Äô fh√†g se teach ifrinn,
    Teachd do ‚Äôn d√πn cheudna air ais, ‚Äôus c√πl ri reulta Pharrais.
    ‚ÄôN uair a thainig an torc dubh, b‚Äôiomadh deamhain ‚Äôga chur,
    Garbh meoghar gach b√©isd, gur h-aon guth sheanmh uile iad;
    Air eagail a bhi gun ni, roinneadh do Mhac Ruaraidh,
    A chuid gu h-onoireach ann, an riochd chon ann an ifrionn.
    Is coir an agradh tha an diugh, aig Allan air na diabhlaibh,
    Ge ‚Äôr bith fa ruig orra, ar leam ni thiom eadrochd,
    Is mithich sgur ri foirionn, sheanmhadhach mhiochaireanach,
    Mhic Ruaraidh o‚Äôn mhuir a mach, fhuair ni gun l√πth gun lamhach.
    Fa chaithream a chur an suim, dligheam coinnidh ri Calum,
    O ‚Äôs e caithream an t√¨r uile, Allan mhaoil a mhionoir,
    Do rinn tusa ‚Äôus ni h-e mh√†in, creach I ‚Äôus reilig Orain,
    Is tu dhochainn gu borb ann, cochull nan ord ‚Äôus nan aifrionn;
    Is tu mh√≤r olc Innse Ghall, is tu bhochd a c√¨s ‚Äôs a tearmunn,
    Is tu is geilte n√≤s a mach, le leantar f√≤s do thoiseach,
    Ach aon bheil air a laimh chl√¨, do bhrathair a Mhic Ruaraidh,
    Ni clos do ghle√≤ o sin a mach, ‚Äôs a chrois bhi ‚Äôg ad mhallachadh,
    Maith an dithis fa an bheil do lan, dubh sin f√≤s is dealbh,
    O cheud thoiseach do chogaidh, a bhreun chlosaich an Aba,
    Creach eile nach robh ‚Äôs an lagh, air Finan an Gleann Garaidh.
    Mhallaich do nimh fhearta f√©in, do mhaol dhealbh, a Allan,
    A ta mar gach nimh eile, a diolt a oirbhireach;
    Chuir d√πthaich le chuis f√©in, an cuthach an gnuis Allain.
    Do shaor dhuthaich ‚Äôus do shluagh, do bhuineadh duit a chr√†dh
          thuath,
    Leigeadh deireadh do mhuirn, eadar Seile, agus Subhairn.
    Ni h-ioghnadh a bhi buininn, fada o binn chroiche, Allan,
    Na luaidhe air lathair an fhir, chaidh ‚Äôg a mhathair ‚Äôus ga
          phiuthair,
    Mithich a nis sguir dhe d‚Äôaoire, a Mhic Ruaraidh ainmh√¨ne,
    Oilean nach greasann greas, caithream d‚Äô√©isgein is oircheas.
                                                              Theasd.

    Fhuaireas mac mar an t-athair, mach thar flathaibh ar n-e√≤lais,
    A airill ‚Äôaghaidh ‚Äôus aigne, ‚Äôus mi ‚Äôg a chaidrimh an Leodhas;
    Fios agus aigne flath, uair rathach le an deantar,
    Deirim leat am mac so fhuair mi, gur a b‚Äôe an Ruaraidh ceudna.
    Is ionann an da ch√πl, is onoir athar dh‚Äô a ‚Äôfholt fainneach,
    Is ionann a mholtar an cathaibh, Torcuil ‚Äôus ‚Äôathair airidheach.
    De‚Äôn tigeadh ri linn Thorcuil, ni e lochda do‚Äôn trom dhaimh,
    Do ni dha beart ‚Äôus buaidhean, aithris a fhuair Mac Colmain.
    Iomadh ceaird air a mholtar, Torcuil an amhra chraoibh,
    Air l√πth ‚Äôus air l√†mhach, cuiridh a thaic gu dol an cathaibh.
    A deir mi dh‚Äô a thaobh, d‚Äô√©is aithne ‚Äôs a e√≤las,
    Nach tainig fear d‚Äôa aois is fearr, no r√¨gh so Leodhais.
    Do bu leis a chairge mhordha, seud a‚Äôs soirbhe a fhuair s√†il,
    De bhronnadh Mac Mhic Thorcuil, da rochdainn tir a fhineadh,
    Aig Mac Ruaraidh nam mircheol, do‚Äôm bitheadh an seann cholg
          snaigheach,
    ‚ÄôN a seud eile a b‚Äôfhior fuanadh, do bhronnadh se r√¨gh Eanaich.
    Sgiath cheannghaig ‚Äôn a seud oirdheirc, fear is farumaich nimheil,
    Usa leis am bronnadh, no a bheil ullamh an sireadh.
    Da am bith an leth m√≤r maith, dh‚Äô eachaibh ‚Äôn an dearg druidhteach,
    Nior bhuineadh fear a chleachdainn, gun bhith fo eachraidh diultach.
    Do bu leis an Dubh Seibhlin, Mac Leoid do ‚Äôn iarrann cliara,
    Leis na th‚Äô aigse an t-each sin, ge b‚Äôe a rachadh d‚Äô a iarraidh.
    Tha aig Torcuil √≤ganaich, nach meathaich an √†m chogaidh,
    Casgadh gach tir dh‚Äô a theaghlach, de shluagh miannach gu cogadh.
    Ni b‚Äôfhearr ‚Äôn a aois Cuchullain, na Torcuil d‚Äôfhulang teanntachd,
    Lamh is calma ‚Äôs is clisde, fear a bhriseas gach a bearna.
    Ge ‚Äôr ionmhuinn Mac Mhic Thorcuil, nior mholainn e air annsachd,
    Fear is treise an uair agha, iuchar ghr√†idh do ‚Äôn bhantrachd.
    Ni bheil mac r√¨gh no flath, do b‚Äôfhaide rath do chualas,
    Ge minic leinn an rochdainn, is fearr no Torcuil a fhuaireas.
    Ni Mhic Chailein, Caitriona, bos mhil earlamh dualchas,
    Inghin Iarla Earaghaidheal, an aon bhean is fearr a fhuaireas.
    Fhuaireamar bean ar n-√¨le, de gheug mhor dhream ghasda,
    Ni Mhic Chailein chraobhach √≤gail, c√πl mar an coirnean cas.
                                                        Fhuaireas.

    Cia b‚Äôe neach nach tuigeadh sin, theachd comhlan do ‚Äôm chumha,
    Na lotsa feuch o‚Äôm chom, tuirse na creuchda ro gheibheam.

    Tha mo chorp gun fheol gun fhuil, mar bhochd gun treoir ...
    Cha-n ioghnadh cumha dh‚Äô a meud, orm an deigh Mhic Mairirid,

    Ge deacair leam dealach‚Äô ris, Mac Eoin a chomhraidh mhilis,
    Is miosa e gun mhilleadh esa, gun bhi tilleadh gu ‚Äôinnis.
    Ge fada a bhitheam o m‚Äô√†gh, us mo luchd tuaileis a‚Äôm dheigh,

    Is trom na aghaidhsan, a l√πth thainig dha aimsir,

    O ‚Äôs e ghuineadar a dhol, truagh nach amhuil a bhamar,

Artuir dail Mac Gurcaich.

    Dail chabhlaich air Chaisteal Suibhne, suairc an eachdraidh an
          Innisfail,
    Marcaich a rachadh nan tonn, glantair barc an tonn nior ghabh.
    Fir arda ag eagar na luingse, air leam luath a leanas cuairt,
    Ni bhith l√†mh gun ghalghath gasd, an aircamh sgarach, snasda,
          suairc.
    Do chotanaibh is duibh dh‚Äô eagradh, do na bharc fa chraobh l√©ig,
    De choraighibh an crios cl√†r-dhaoine, Lochlanaich is armuinn iad.
    De chleathaimh gon √≤r ‚Äôus deud, eagar bh√†rc nam breid donn,
    An aireamh cliath de ghathaibh galghath, sgiath ri fraighibh
     lamhrach long.
    Air sgiath sgiothach air sgud breac, br√π sgarach chorcrach,
          chlothara,
    Broin fhad caomh ‚Äôus comhlair, air taobh nan slat ro gharbh.
    Gaoth ghorm an guailnibh an luath bharc, long ‚Äôg a lionadh an
     √©iridh traigh,
    Cliabh theann do chochuinge de cholgaibh, foirionn sg√©ith ri
          bordaibh b√†rc.
    Mnathan fionn an grianaibh ‚Äôn longsa, leabaidh ard aig nigheanaibh
          mhall,
    Pille bhreac dhoibh gun d‚Äôfhuaireadh, leap aig mnathaibh
     ri eanfhlaith ann.
    Pille bhreac de shroil is taithneal, is e sin lothar an long,
    Baoibh, shonnanach, ‚Äôs an ruathar gu dol, ‚Äôshroil chorcuir os
          gach crann.
    Gun lamhan chruaidh gun chrios cuide, nar garbh sios gun chur
          ri cleir,
    Na seoid d‚Äôeirich ann gun imirt, de chliaraibh, clann bhinn
          ard bh√©il.
    Nior chualas urdail an Fhian, dh ‚Äôur n-innis gun chuir ri ceaird,
    Na seoid √πr o Eirinn aca de‚Äôn bhroin bhar-sheang, dathta, dearg.
    Ni luath leatha long dhe ‚Äôn longaibh, am bi na neach ‚Äôus ni ‚Äôd beo,
    Gun och, gun lionn dubh, gun bhr√≤n, ‚Äôs ni bheil teirginn loma leo.
    Ni shaoileadh si luath cairbh de chairbhibh, an l√†n de ‚Äôn n√≤s
     shinte uaith,
    Aig roinn √≤r air bh√†rdaibh, ri h-√†rd dhoibh cairbhe cuain.
    Iomadh fear lann ‚Äôus fear luirich, iomadh fear luath gu leum catha,
    Ri s√πgh muinghin fairg fearghuin, ra h-ard an luing banchair blaith.
    Cia so le soltar an cabhlach, air chaislean Suibhne Sleibh troma,
    Fear sreangach nach seachnadh seideadh, le chroinn sireadh
          chuid c√≤ir.
    Eoin Mac Suibhne, seol an longsa, air druim a chuain, cruaidh
          an ceann,
    Croinn an luing dean chur an aird, dearbhaid tuinn a bharc sin ....
    Gaoth gun d‚Äô√©irich dhoibh ‚Äôn an deigh, aig Caol Aca deireadh tr√†igh,
    Siuil bhreaca dhoibh ‚Äôn am bolgaibh, Eoin a teachd gu bord ...
    Gabhas an acarsaid aoibhin, an uchd Chnapadail coirce ...
    An amhra mh√≤r, tiugh, donn, dealbhach, lacharach, crannach,
     luath ‚Äôus ...
    Leinn aig ballachaibh Albainn, furtach failteach ri uchd sloimh ...
    Aluinn sin an corcradh comhlan, sileadh driuchd lomlan loinn.
    Failteach aig sruthaibh Sleibh Muin, ri Mac Suibhne Sleibh Mis,
    Tigidh cainntich d‚Äôfhogus ‚Äônan eirbhar, daltair mar rosg roinnlan
          ris.
    Leigidh geug an gl√πn fo fh√†irtidh, faillteach ri ‚Äôr bhlaith goil,
    Misde slainte c√πl gach cala, trom am failte an aghaidh Eoin.
    Tigidh aois Eilein Albainn, a farrach faillte air o‚Äôn thonn meise,
    Luchd cainnte mar bhuinear, deichnear faillte o rannaibh ris.
    Greath bhi iomarbhaidh ann, eadara f√©in ann an ce√≤l,
    Aithne nithear doibh ‚Äôs an deagh uair, mar tha tulach √†ine Eoin.
    Do nithead cath an Caislean Suibhne, fa sheabhag chroidhein
          a chroinn bhuirb,
    Suidhead fa thimchioll an sgor sin, fionnmhor nimh luslan luirg.
    De shleigh thollas taobh namhaid, mar nimh nathair guineich grannd,
    Caol chlaidheamh o ghreas a fhuair, meilnichear leis colna Ghall.
    Ceilearmaid uile Mhic Suibhne, ri soillse an fhad ghlug d‚Äô an
          chuain,
    Is fior nach dean do ‚Äôn ghlug an cabhar, ‚Äôs e dian, diultnach,
          balglan, m√≤r.
    Ni‚Äôr nach dian doibh luireach threibheir air sgiath chotan
          na sgeith donn,
    Gabhas Reachlinn sgian-gheur sgarach, meobhar claidhean calma corr.
    An tan chlaidheamh is fearr ‚Äôs an Eorpa, se is luireach le
          na ‚Äôs miann,
    Cia sgiath ‚Äôs an domhain nach diongainn, treabhach gun on cloinn
          Eirinn.
    Eoin Mac Suibhne na sligheadach, le ‚Äôcholg tan, teasgach, mhall,
    Fear noch ‚Äôsgiath bhi sgiath bhreac, dhonn, fhuaireas treabhach,
          deaghrunach, dall.
                                                      Dail chabhlaich.

NOTE BY TRANSLATOR.


The Dean‚Äôs MS. was put into the hands of the present translator a few
years ago by Mr. Cosmo Innes, with a view to a correct account being
given of its contents. After a considerable time spent on deciphering
the difficult handwriting, and resolving the strange and irregular
orthography, he gave a fuller account of it than had been given before,
in a paper read before the Society of Scottish Antiquaries. He was
aware that a transcript of the MS. had been made by a Gaelic scholar of
the highest reputation, the late Mr. M‚ÄòLachlan of Aberdeen; but that
transcript was altogether unknown save by one or two individuals, and
was at the time thought to be lost. In December 1860, the publishers
proposed to the writer that he should undertake transcribing and
translating the MS. with notes, Mr. Skene undertaking to write a
historical introduction, with additional notes. There was good reason
for reluctance in undertaking such a work. There was immense difficulty
in the task itself, consisting very much in an exercise of ingenuity,
the results to be tested by comparison, in guessing the meaning of
words phonetically spelled; there was the labour of writing the same
thing in three different forms; and there was in all this large demands
upon time otherwise engrossed by the duties of a profession, whose
calls the keeping of a good conscience, and duty to a Divine Master,
would not admit of being neglected or postponed. The work itself,
however, was very congenial, as contributing somewhat to the literature
of the Celtic countrymen of the writer, the literature of a period,
too, of which few other literary remains of theirs exist. He therefore
undertook to devote his spare hours for a season to the work, which is
now laid before the public.

The difficulties did not become less than was anticipated when they
came to be practically dealt with. There was first the transcription
of the original. A facsimile specimen of the writing is given in this
volume, from which some idea may be formed of its character. The
handwriting is the current English hand of the fifteenth century, with
a few additional peculiarities borrowed from the Gaelic writing of the
same period, as practised both in Scotland and Ireland. As is common
in the writing of the period, the same sign is used both for _c_ and
_t_. There is often no distinction between _o_ and _e_, _u_ and _n_,
or _¬É∆í_ and _s_; and in the hurry of writing the Dean often wrote _m_
for _n_, and _vice vers√¢_; and the letter _z_ stands for all the sounds
resembling the consonant _y_. Besides, there are numerous contractions,
the same sign being often used for _in_, _im_, and _ir_, and the Irish
dot (¬∑) is often used as a substitute for _h_. The MS. is in many
places much decayed, and the writing in consequence much obscured,
while the orthography is by no means quite regular. The transcript
has, however, been carefully made from the original, and compared
again in proof, and the reader, with the allowance necessary in the
circumstances already described, may feel assured that in the original,
as printed, he has a correct copy of the Dean‚Äôs work.

The work, however, was not beyond the threshold when the transcription
was complete. It was in interpreting the Dean‚Äôs phonetic Gaelic, so as
to form the modern Gaelic edition, that the chief difficulty arose;
and here the translator was left altogether without guide to lead
the way, except in the case of a few of the Ossianic poems. There
were three peculiar difficulties to be encountered here,--first, the
frequent occurrence of obsolete words,--words not to be found in any
dictionary of the Scottish Gaelic,--and the meaning of which could only
be learned from some acquaintance with the ancient MS. writings of
Scottish and Irish scribes; secondly, there was the introduction into
the Dean‚Äôs grammar of the Irish eclipsis, turning in his orthography
_f_ into _w_, _c_ into _g_, _b_ into _m_, and _d_ into _n_, without
any hyphen; and there was, last of all, the accentuation, which, in
a number of the pieces, lays the emphasis on the latter syllable of
dissyllabic words, and thus alters to a Scotch reader the whole rhythm
of the lines. Many of these pieces will not read as poetry at all,
unless read in accordance with the Irish method of accentuation. It was
known to all acquainted with early Gaelic literature, how much there
was that was common to the literature of Scotland and Ireland. This
miscellany fully establishes the fact, while it also shows that, in the
fifteenth century, Scottish Gaelic, as exemplified in some of these
compositions, especially those of Finlay M‚ÄôNab, had its own distinctive
features. There is nothing more interesting than the weight given in
the allusions in these poems to the existence and influence of the
Bardic schools at the period, and the large prizes usually conferred by
the wealthy on successful poets.

The translation into English was, upon the whole, a less arduous
process than the previous one. It might have been otherwise had the
attempt been made to translate into English poetry. This, however, has
been carefully avoided. The rendering has been made so literal as that
the meaning of every sentence in Gaelic is conveyed in English, so far
as the editor has been able to do it; and the translation is merely
somewhat lightened, and the reading made more agreeable, by having the
baldness of mere literality removed, and the lines made somewhat smooth
and flowing.

In some cases the spelling and handwriting together have so obscured
the words, that the editor has been quite unable to give anything like
a satisfactory rendering; hence there will be found, in a very few
instances, what are apparently different words in the original and
modern version. Some instances will also be found of words written in
the modern version according to the analogy of the Dean‚Äôs orthography,
while the precise word intended has not been identified. The editor has
only to say regarding these and any other cases of doubtful rendering,
which in such a work must be numerous, that he will be happy to receive
through the publishers any suggestions from Gaelic scholars which may
help to secure greater accuracy.

It is only necessary to say farther, that in extending the modern
Gaelic version of these poems, it was perfectly impossible to exclude
all the older forms of the language. In many places to do so would
have been to destroy the whole poetical structure of the composition.
It was essential to retain the ‚Äúda,‚Äù _if_, the ‚Äúfa,‚Äù _on_, or _under_,
and the ‚Äúco‚Äù or ‚Äúgo,‚Äù _with_, besides numerous forms of the verb,
which it is the practice now to call Irish, but which were common at
an early period to the literature of both countries. It was perfectly
impossible, with anything like justice to these compositions, to bring
them into exact conformity with the rules of modern Scottish Gaelic.

The present volume contains every line of Ossianic or Fenian poetry
in the Dean‚Äôs MS. It also contains every composition having reference
to Scotland, with the exception of five; two of these being so much
defaced, and so many of the words obscured by time and exposure, that
it is impossible to give anything like an accurate version of them.
The other three are eulogies on the clan Gregor chiefs, so much of a
piece with those already given, that they would not contribute to the
literary value of the work. The purely Irish poems of the O‚ÄôHuggins,
the O‚ÄôDalys, etc., are not given in this work, whose object is to
illustrate the language and literature of the Scottish Highlands at an
early period. A few specimens, such as the laments of Gormlay, wife of
Nial Glundubh, and daughter of Flann Sionna, Queen of Ireland, have
been transcribed as specimens, which may be not uninteresting either
to the Scottish or Irish reader. The Irish compositions are, with few
exceptions, of a religious character.

In a note at p. 43, it is said that an edition of the poem by Allan
M‚ÄôRory, there translated, would be given at the close of the work, as
taken down from the recitation of an old woman, Christina Sutherland,
in Caithness, in the year 1854. It is now given, but without a
translation, which is not thought necessary.

ADDITIONAL NOTES.


(_Introduction_, p. XV.)


DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IRISH AND SCOTCH GAELIC.


Dr. O‚ÄôDonovan, in his Irish Grammar, gives a statement of these
differences, which is somewhat meagre. He appears, however, to have
had little knowledge of Scotch Gaelic, except what he gathered from
Stewart‚Äôs Grammar; and this statement of the differences between the
two dialects is taken almost _verbatim_ from a prior statement of them
by P. M‚ÄôEligott, in the Transactions of the Gaelic Society, published
in 1808, p. 15.

Dr. O‚ÄôDonovan, in his account of grammars previously published,
gives Stewart very just praise for the excellence of his Grammar;
but throughout his own work he never loses an opportunity of carping
at him, and is especially indignant at him for daring to state that
the Scotch Gaelic wants the present tense of the verb, and very
disingenuously quotes Shaw‚Äôs Grammar as a superior authority. He
likewise attacks Stewart for not producing ancient MSS. to prove
it, and for not seeing that the present tense is used by Bishop
Carsewell, in 1564. Stewart, however, was not undertaking a grammar
of the _ancient_ Scotch Gaelic, but of the dialect _then_ spoken
by the people; and most unquestionably, in the spoken dialect of
Stewart‚Äôs time, the present tense was not used. Dr. O‚ÄôDonovan denies
this fact, and even charges Stewart with dishonesty. His theory is,
‚Äúthat Stewart was induced to reject this tense, in order to establish
a striking point of resemblance between the Erse and the Hebrew,
which the Irish, supposed to be the mother tongue, had not,‚Äù--a most
unworthy insinuation, and most unphilosophical, for O‚ÄôDonovan ought
to have known that the changes which take place in the structure of
spoken languages proceed from organic laws which cannot be influenced
or directed by grammarians. The will of any single man is powerless
to alter the minutest particle in the language; and the fact that the
inflected present tense is not used in Scotch Gaelic, is evident to any
one acquainted with the language, or who has come in contact with those
who speak it.

Dr. O‚ÄôDonovan also finds fault with Stewart for expressing an opinion
that, ‚Äúas the Erse dialect has not the inflections in the termination
of its verbs, which characterize the Irish, it is therefore more
original than the Irish.‚Äù This is, no doubt, an erroneous view; and
O‚ÄôDonovan correctly states ‚Äúthat the mode of inflection, by varying
the termination, is more ancient than the use of particles;‚Äù but he
might have recollected that the contrary opinion was very generally
held when Stewart wrote; that the sounder principles of philology, in
this respect, were not known or understood till after the publication
of his Grammar; and that he could not, with any candour, impute it to
him as a fault that he had not anticipated the conclusions of a science
which had, so to speak, been created subsequently to his time. That
the same peculiarities existed in the language in the last century, is
proved by the fact that the Gaelic colonists in Canada, who have been
separated from the mother country since that period, speak a form of
Scotch Gaelic precisely similar to that now spoken in the Highlands,
and possessing all those dialectic peculiarities which distinguish it
from Irish. Although the present tense of the verb is usually expressed
by the auxiliary, the Highlanders also use the future tense to express
the present.

The leading differences between Irish and Scotch Gaelic may be stated
generally as follows:--


SOUNDS OF THE LANGUAGE.

1. The initial consonants are not affected to the same extent as in
Irish and Welsh; and in pure Scotch Gaelic the eclipsis is unknown,
except in the case of the letter _S_.

The following table will show their relative position in this respect:--

2. In Irish, words beginning with _A_ may take the digamma _F_, as
_aill_, _faill_, a rock; _ata_, _fata_, a plain; _iolair_, _fiolair_,
an eagle, etc. The digamma never appears in Scotch Gaelic.

3. The vowel sounds _O_ and _U_ in Irish, pass into _A_ in Scotch
Gaelic; as, _oir_, Ir., _air_, Sc. G.; _og_, Ir., _ag_, Sc. G.;
_ugadh_, Ir., _achadh_, Sc. G.; _chuaidh_, Ir., _chaidh_, Sc. G.

4. The vowel at the end of nouns in Irish, is dropped in Scotch Gaelic;
as, _tigherna_, Ir., _tighearn_, Sc. G.

5. In the consonants the older form is often retained in Scotch Gaelic;
thus, the initial _S_ in Irish, is often _D_ in Scotch Gaelic, which is
the older form, as _suil_, Ir., _duil_, Sc. G.,--hope. _S_ is sometimes
changed to _P_, as _siuthar_, Ir., _piuthar_, Sc. G.,--sister.

6. The accentuation in Scotch Gaelic in dissyllables is on the first
syllable; in Irish, on the last.


GRAMMAR.


1. _Article._

The genitive plural before a labial is _nam_.


2. _Noun._

The nominative plural frequently ends like Welsh and Manx in _an_; as,
_Slatan_, rods; _Maithean_, chiefs.


3. _Verbs._

The analytic form is alone used, there being no inflections for persons
or numbers.

The Irish present is used as the future, and there is no present
tense.[279]

The past-participle is invariably _te_ hard, and is not varied as in
Irish.

There are no consuetudinary tenses.

[279] In the old form of the verb, in German, the present tense
exercised likewise the function of the future.


4. _Adverb._

The negative is _Cha_, instead of _Ni_, in Irish.


VOCABULARY.

There is a considerable difference in the vocabulary words being now
used in Irish, which are unknown in Scotch Gaelic, and _vice versa_,
and a comparison of the lists of idiomatic phrases in Irish or Scotch
Gaelic shows a very great difference in the mode of expressing familiar
phrases.[280]

[280] Since this note was written, the writer has learned with great
regret of the death of Dr. O‚ÄôDonovan, and hesitated whether these
strictures on some opinions in his able Irish Grammar ought to be
retained, but justice to an equally able Scotch grammarian seemed to
require them; and he may be allowed this opportunity of expressing
his sincere admiration of the great learning and knowledge of that
distinguished Irish scholar, and his sense of the loss which Celtic
philology has sustained by his lamented death.


(_Introduction_, p. lxxxiv.)

The Welsh poem alluded to is contained in the Welsh Arch√¶ology, vol. i.
p. 168. The text is, however, very corrupt. It has been translated by
Mr. Stephen in the _Arch√¶ologia Cambrensis_, new Series, vol. ii. p.
150, who did not, however, see its real character, and very strangely
supposes it to refer to the actions of Cuichelm, one of the West Saxon
kings, who died in 636, and whom he identifies with the Chocholyn of
the poem, while of Corroi, son of Dairy, he can give no account.

The poem is in reality an Ossianic poem referring to the death of
Curoi, son of Daire, by Cuchullin, the celebrated Fenian hero of Ulster.

Keating gives the following account of the death of Curoi:--‚ÄúThe heroes
of the red branch united to plunder an island near Alban, called
Manann, where there was a great quantity of gold, silver, jewels, and
many other valuable articles, and a lovely marriageable young lady, who
surpassed all the women of her time in exquisite figure and beauty,
the daughter of the governor of the island, and her name was Blanaid.
When Curigh was informed that the heroes were setting out on this
expedition, he transformed himself by magic into a disguised shape, and
joined the party; but when they were on the point of plundering the
island, disguised like jugglers, they judged that there would be great
difficulty in taking the fortress in the island, in which were secured
Blanaid and the valuable treasures of the whole island, on account of
its strength and the number of men who defended it. Then Curigh, who
was attired in a coarse grey habit, engaged, if he were to get his
choice of the treasures, that he would himself take possession of the
fort. Cuchullin promises this, and immediately they attacked the castle
with the man in the grey habit at their head, who stopped the motion
of an enchanted wheel that was placed at the castle gate, and let in
all the troops, by whom the fortress was sacked, and Blanaid and all
the treasure borne away. They then set out for Ireland, and arrived at
Evan; and on dividing the treasure, the man in the grey habit demands
his choice of the jewels, as was promised to him. ‚ÄôYou shall have it,‚Äô
says Cuchullin. ‚ÄôWell, then,‚Äô says he, ‚ÄôBlanaid is the jewel I choose,‚Äô
‚ÄôTake your choice of all the jewels except Blanaid alone,‚Äô replies
Cuchullin. ‚ÄôI will not exchange her,‚Äô says Curigh, and thereupon he
seeks to carry her off by force; and having surprised her unperceived,
took her away concealed under an enchanted mask. When Cuchullin
perceived that the lady was missing, he suspected that it was Curigh
that stole her off, and pursued them directly to Munster, and overtook
them at Sulchoid. The champions engage, and a brave and well-fought
contest ensues; but at length Cuchullin was overcome by Curigh, who
tied him neck and heels, and left him shackled like a captive, after
cutting off his hair with his sword, and then carried away Blanaid into
the west of Munster. Then, however, came up Laogh mac Riain of Gabhra,
and unbound Cuchullin, and they set out for the north of Ulster, where
they resided near the peaks of Boirche for the space of a year, without
appearing in the Council of Ulster, until Cuchullin‚Äôs hair grew again;
and at the expiration of the year, happening to be on the peaks of
Boirche, he saw a great flight of birds coming on the sea to the north,
and on their landing upon the shore, he pursues them, and by a feat
called _Taveim_, killed one of them with his sling in every district
he passed through, until the last of them fell at Sruv Bron, in the
west of Munster. On his return from the west, he found Blanaid in
solitude near the Finglass, in Kerry, where Curigh had a palace at that
time. A conversation ensued between them, in which she declared to him
that there was not on the face of the earth a man she loved more, and
entreated him to come near Allhallow tide with an armed band, and carry
her off with him by force; and that he might the more easily accomplish
his design, she would take care that Curigh should, at that time, have
but few soldiers or attendants. Cuchullin promises to come to her at
the appointed time, and then takes his leave, and sets out for Ulster,
and relates the adventure to Choncubar.

In the meantime Blanaid told Curigh that he ought to erect a palace
for himself that should exceed all the royal palaces in the kingdom,
and that he might do so by sending the Clanna Deaguid to gather and
collect all the large upright stones in the kingdom to form this
palace. Blanaid‚Äôs reason for this was, that the Clanna Deaguid might
be dispersed in distant parts of Ireland, far from Curigh, at the time
that Cuchullin should come to carry her off. Cuchullin, being informed
that the Clanna Deaguid were scattered over the kingdom, sets out
privately, and soon arrived at a wood near the seat of Curigh, and
sends secretly to inform Blanaid of his arrival with a large body of
troops along with him. She sends him word that she would steal Curigh‚Äôs
sword; and then, as a sign of attack, that she would spill a large
vessel of new milk that was in the house into the rivulet which flowed
from the castle through the wood where Cuchullin was concealed. Having
heard this, in a short time he perceived the stream white with the
milk, when, sallying out, they forced into the palace, and slew Curigh,
who was alone and unarmed, and took Blanaid away with them to Ulster.‚Äù

TRANSLATION.

THE DEATH-SONG OF CORROY, SON OF DAIRY.

                     I.
    Thy large fountain fills the river,
    Thy coming will make thy value of little worth,
    The death-song of Corroy agitates me.

                    II.
    If the warrior will come, rough his temper.
    And his evil was greater than its renown was great,
    To seize the son of Dairy, lord of the Southern Sea.
    Celebrated was his praise before she was intrusted to him.

                    III.
    Thy large fountain fills the stream.
    Thy coming will cause saddling without haste.
    The death-song of Corroi is with me now.

                    IV.
    Thy large fountain fills the deep;
    Thy arrows traverse the strand, not frowning or depressed.
    The warrior conquers, great his rank of soldiers,

(_Line wanting._)

    And after penetrating, enters the towns,
    And ... the pure stream was promptly whitened.
    Whilst the victorious one in the morning heaps carnage,
    Tales will be known to me from the sky to earth,
    Of the encounter of Corroi and Chocholyn.
    Numerous their tumults about their borders,
    Springs the chief o‚Äôer the surrounding mead of the
          somewhat gentle wood.
    A city there was, love--diffusing, not paling, not trembling.
    Happy is he whose soul is rewarded.

The allusions in this poem are to Cuchullin‚Äôs expedition to attack
Curroi, to Blanaid‚Äôs giving the signal by filling the stream with milk
from a large vessel, and to the encounter between Curroi and Cuchullin,
in which the former fell.

It may not be out of place to insert here a few stanzas of an old Manx
historical poem, written between 1504 and 1522, to show the relation of
the Manx orthography to the Welsh and to that of the Dean of the same
age.

                     I.
    Dy neaishtagh shin aghrish my skeayll
    As dy ving lhielu ayns my chant
    Myr share dy voddyms lesh my veeal,

    Quoi yn chied er ec row rieau ee

TRANSLATION.

    If you would listen to my story,
    I will pronounce my chant
    As best I can. I will with my mouth
    Give you notice of the Holy Island;
    Who he was that had it first,
    And then what happened to him;
    And how Patrick brought in Christianity,
    And how it came to Stanley.
    Manannan beg was son of Leirr,
    He was the first that ever had it;
    But as I can best conceive,
    He himself was not a Christian.


_Poems_, p. 3.

This poem has a strong resemblance in its character and sentiment to
the oldest poems in the Cymmrian dialect.

The oldest known poem in this dialect which has been preserved in
its original orthography is a short poem of three stanzas, written
in the Irish character in a parchment MS. at Cambridge, containing a
paraphrase of the Gospels by Iuvencus, a Latin poet. The writing of
this MS. is anterior to the year 700.

The poem is as follows:--

                  I.
    Ni guorcosam nemheunaur henoid,
    Mi telu nit gurmaur.
    Mi am franc dam an calaur.

                 II.
    Ni canu ni guardam ni cusam henoid,
    Cet iben med nouel
    Mi am franc dam an patel.

                 III.
    Na mereit im nepleguenit henoid
    Is diszur mi coueidid
    Donn am riceur im guetid.

It is the song of a warrior mourning his fate and his solitude, and may
be thus translated:--

    Neither repose nor sleep for me this night,
    My house is no longer great.
    For me and my servant no caldron more,
    No songs, no smiles, no kisses this night,
    As when I drank the fortifying mead.
    For me and my servant no goblet more,
    No longer joy for me this night.
    My supporter is discouraged;
    No one aids me in my distress.

The Irish character, in which this poem is written, is of the eighth
century, and Villemarqu√© has remarked upon its resemblance in sentiment
and character to a poem of Llywarch Hen, a Cumbrian bard of the sixth
or seventh century, whose poems are universally admitted to be
genuine, the orthography of which is much more modern. The poem is in
triplets, the first line also ending with ‚Äúheno,‚Äù and a single stanza
or two will show the resemblance:--

    Y stafel Kyndylan nis esmwyth-heno
    Ar benn karec Hydwyth
    Heb ner, Heb nifer, Heb ammwyth.

    Istafel kyndylan ys tywyll--heno
    Heb dan, Heb gerddau
    Dygystudd deurudd dagrau.

The following are a few of the verses:--

    The hall of Kyndylan is not joyous this night,
    On the top of the rock of Hydwyth,
    Without its lord, without company, without feasts.
    The hall of Kyndylan is gloomy this night,
    Without fire, without songs,
    Tears afflict the cheeks.

The poem, attributed to Ossian in the Dean‚Äôs MS., is of the same
character:--

    Long are the clouds this night above me;
    The last was a long night to me.
    This day, although I find it long,
    Yesterday was longer still.

           *       *       *       *       *

    Long are the clouds this night above me.
    No rising up to noble feats;
    No mirthful sport as we would wish,
    No swimming heroes on our lakes.
    Long are the clouds this night above me, etc.


_Poem_, p. 4.

This is a well-known poem, termed Sliabh nam ban Fionn. A copy almost
identic with this is published by the Ossianic Society of Dublin in
their sixth volume, and a comparison of the first stanza with that of
the Dean will show the relation the orthography of it bears to his:--

               DEAN.
    La zay deacha finn mo rayth
    Di helg er sleyve ny ban finn
    Tri meillith wathyon ny wayn
    Ne zeaath skaow vass in ginn.

               IRISH.
    La da n-deachaidh Fionn na bhfiann
    Do sheilg ar shliabh na m-ban fionn
    Tri mhile do mhaithibh na bhfiann
    Sul n-deachaidh grian os ar g-cionn.

It will be observed that the Irish eclipsis is only partially
recognised by the Dean.

There is a copy of this poem in Kennedy‚Äôs Collection, p. 29.

The number of verses is the same, but some variation occurs in the
reading of several of them.

Dr. Smith remarks, in the Highland Society‚Äôs Report, that an edition
of this poem, under the title of La mor Seilg na Feinne, occurs in the
oral recitations communicated by the Rev. Francis Stewart of Craignish,
and another was written from memory by Archibald M‚ÄôCallum.


_Poem_, p. 20.

The King of Sorcha is here opposed to the daughter of the King of
the Tir fo thuinn, or land beneath the waves; and in this respect it
resembles the Welsh poems, where the King of Annwn and his daughter
play so great a part.

Sorcha is light, in opposition to Dorcha, dark; and there seems to be a
poetic contrast between the kingdom of light and the kingdom under the
waves.

Historically the land under the waves was the low-lying coast of
Holland and Germany, extending from the Rhine to the Elbe.

Dr. Smith remarks that this poem differs little from Kennedy‚Äôs and
other oral editions in the possession of the Society.


_Poem_, p. 26.

There is an edition of this poem in one of M‚ÄôVurich‚Äôs MSS. in the
collection deposited in the Faculty Library. The language is more
Irish than the Dean‚Äôs. The first verse may be given for the purpose of
comparison:--

          DEAN.
    Sai la guss in dei
    Oy nach vaga mai finn
    Chanaka rem rai
    Sai boo yar lym.

        M‚ÄôVURICH.
    Se la gus an de
    Nach faca me fionn
    Ni fhaca re mo re
    Se budh faide leam.

It will be observed that the Dean uses the Scotch negative _Cha_, while
M‚ÄôVurich has the Irish _Ni_.


_Poem_, p. 30.

Dr. Smith states that this poem corresponds in a great measure with one
taken down from oral recitation in Sutherland and another in Isla.


_Poems_, p. 35 and p. 48.

This poem is one of the editions of the Cath Gabhra, and, along with
the poem by Feargus Filidh on the same subject, forms part of the long
poem called Cath Gabhra, printed by the Ossianic Society of Dublin in
their first volume.

In this poem it is said--

    Eastward we sent ambassadors,
    To Fatha of Conn‚Äôs great son,

Or more literally--

    To Fatha, son of Maccon.

The expression east or eastward always refers to Alba or Scotland, in
contradistinction to west, which was Sire, and the allusion here is to
one of the mythic colonies from Ireland to Scotland.

In addition to the historic colony of Dalriada in the sixth century,
the Irish historians record four colonies in prehistoric times.

These were--

1. Dalriads under Cairbre Riada, in the third century.

2. The Clanna Breogan, under the Fathads, sons of Lugad Mac Con, King
of Ireland, in the third century, from whom the Campbells are said to
be descended.

3. Eremonians, under Colla Uais, King of Ireland, in the fourth
century, from whom the M‚ÄôDonalds are said to be descended.

4. Eberians, under Cairbre Cruithnechan and Maine Leamhna, sons of Corc
mac Lughadh, in the fourth century, from whom the Maormers of Marr and
Lennox are said to be descended.

The second of these colonies, under Fatha Canann, is here connected
with the legends of the Feinne.

Dr. Smith states that this poem agrees, with some variation in words
and arrangement, with one transmitted by Mr. Maclagan from oral recital.

The poem on the battle of Gabhra, attributed to Fergus, is obviously
the older piece, and some of the stanzas are the same with those in the
Irish poems. It also refers to the Feinne of Britain and of Lochlan.

There is an edition of this poem in Kennedy‚Äôs Collection, p. 148; and
another, taken down from recitation, was communicated to the Highland
Society by Mr. Malcolm M‚ÄôDonald.

The first stanza of this poem, with the corresponding stanza in the
Irish poem, is given for the purpose of comparison:--

          DEAN.
    Innis donn a earris
    Ille feynni errin
    Kynis tarle zevin
    In gath zawrych ni beymin.

          IRISH.
    Innis duinn a Oisin
    Re h‚Äôanam Fhianna Eirionn
    Cia agaibh ba threise
    I g-cath Gabhra na m-beimionn.

It will be again observed that the eclipsis is only partially
recognised. The Dean seems rarely to employ it in the genitive plural,
where it is rigorously demanded by the rules of Irish grammar.


_Poem_, p. 50.

Dr. Smith remarks that this poem agrees very much with one got from
Isla by recitation, and communicated to the Society by Robert Campbell,
Esq., Advocate.


_Poem_, p. 54.

Dr. Smith states that this poem, on the death of Fraoch, differs
very little from Mr. Jerome Stone‚Äôs edition, and still less from Mr.
Gillies‚Äô Collection, page 107.


_Poem_, p. 58.

Dr. Smith remarks that this poem nearly agrees with one in Kennedy‚Äôs
Collection, p. 69. Some of the names are different, and the stanzas not
all in the same order.

The same poem appears, with a few lines more or less, and a slight
variation of words and arrangement, in one of the MSS. deposited in the
Faculty Library; and two editions were communicated to the Highland
Society taken down from oral recitation, one from an old man in Isla,
the other from Donald M‚ÄôCallum in Kilcalmonell, in Kintyre.


_Poem_, p. 72.

The idea which forms the subject of this poem is common to the Gael and
the Welsh.


_Poem by Gilchrist Taylor_, p. 93.

This poem certainly refers to the taking of the murderers of James I.,
by Robert Reoch Duncanson of Strowan, and John Gorme Stewart of Garth.
Robert Reoch bears on his seal two greyhounds, and on 15th August
1451 received a charter from James II. of the barony of Strowan ‚Äúpro
zelo, favore et amore quos gerimus erga dictum Robertum Duncanson pro
captione iniquissimi proditoris quondam Roberti de Graham.‚Äù

John Gorme Stewart receives in the Exchequer Rolls a payment ‚Äúpro
arrestatione Roberti Grahame traditoris et suorum complicium.‚Äù


_Poem by John of Knoydart_, p. 99.

In the Annals of Ulster there is the following notice of the murder of
Angus Og, son of John, Lord of the Isles:--

Aois Criost 1490, Mac mic Domnaill na h-Alpan,.i. Aengus, .i. nec
da n-gairti an Tigerna Aacc do marbad a fill le ferted Erennac,.i.
Diarmidt h-ua Cairpri, 7 a n Inhernis do marbad h-e. That is,--Year of
Christ 1490, Angus, son of Macdonald of Scotland, who was called the
young Lord, was murdered by his Irish harper, Dermed O‚ÄôCairbre, and at
Inverness he was slain.

The Annals of Ulster are cotemporary authority for the event.


_Poem by Finlay M‚ÄôNab_, p. 125.

The Dougall, son of John, who is here reproached as a sluggard, and
exhorted to write in the Book of Poems, was no doubt the Dean‚Äôs
father, Dougall Johnson. It would appear from this that the taste for
collecting Gaelic poetry was a family quality.

The genealogical poems relating to the M‚ÄôGregors, M‚ÄôDougalls, and
M‚ÄôDonalds, are curious, but it would be out of place to enter here upon
the family history of these clans.

LORD DUNFERMLINE.

     Memoir of Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, K.
          B., 1793-1801. By his Son JAMES LORD DUNFERMLINE.
          In 1 vol. demy 8vo.

          ‚ÄúIt is peculiarly refreshing to meet with a
          biography of an individual so illustrious as
          Sir Ralph Abercromby, from the pen of one so
          eminent in many respects as the late Lord
          Dunfermline.‚Äù--_Caledonian Mercury, October 3._

          ‚ÄúHis grandson, the present Lord Dunfermline, by
          causing this memoir to be printed and published,
          has conferred a benefit upon all--and they are
          fortunately many--who treasure the memory of
          distinguished men.‚Äù--_Literary Gazette, October 5._

Arch√¶ological Catalogue:--

          A Catalogue of Antiquities, Works of Arts, and
          Historical Scottish Relics, exhibited in Museum
          of the Arch√¶ological Institute of Great Britain
          and Ireland during their annual meeting, held
          in Edinburgh, July 1856, under the patronage of
          H. R. H. The Prince Consort, K.G., comprising
          notices of the portraits of Mary Queen of Scots,
          collected on that occasion. Illustrated, royal
          8vo, cloth, 21s.

Angelo Sanmartino, a Tale of Lombardy in 1859. Crown 8vo,
cloth, 10s. 6d.

          ‚ÄúA pretty story enough, and vraisemblable
          enough for the effect desired to be produced
          by the author, which is to awaken in the
          minds of ordinary English novel readers a
          lively feeling for the cause of Italian
          independence.‚Äù--_Spectator, December 29._

          ‚ÄúWe admire the character of Angelo, and heartily
          commend it to public favour; it is admirably
          written; the subject is one dear to every lover
          of freedom and honour.--_Commonwealth, December
          15, 1860._

     Odal Rights and Feudal Wrongs: a Memorial for Orkney.
          By DAVID BALFOUR of Balfour and Trenaby. 1 vol.
          8vo, price 6s.

          ‚ÄúWe gather from the book that Mr. Balfour is an
          Orcadian Laird, Odaller, or whatever the proper
          title may be now-a-days. Certainly he is a sound
          and careful antiquary, well versed in the local
          history of the old Jarldom, and fully entitled
          to a hearing for anything which he may say about
          it.‚Äù--_Saturday Review, March 1861._

          ‚ÄúTo antiquarians, and especially those
          connected with Orkney, this book will be a rich
          acquisition.--_Orkney Herald, October 23, 1860._

          ‚ÄúThis book is an interesting contribution to
          Scottish history.‚Äù--_Athen√¶um, January 27._

          ‚ÄúSir David Brewster‚Äôs ‚ÄôLife of Sir Isaac Newton‚Äô

          the public a share of his bye-hours, and more
          pleasant hours than these it would be difficult
          to find in any life.

          ‚ÄúDr. Brown‚Äôs masterpiece is the story of a dog
          called ‚ÄôRab.‚Äô The tale moves from the most tragic
          pathos to the most reckless humour, and could not
          have been written but by a man of genius. Whether
          it moves tears or laughter, it is perfect in

          ‚ÄúMr. Campbell has published a collection of
          tales, which will be regarded as one of the
          greatest literary surprises of the present
          century. It is the first instalment of what
          was to be expected from any fair statement of
          the scientific value of popular tales.... It
          required some striking demonstration of the real
          worth of popular tales to arouse Gaelic scholars
          from their apathy. They have been aroused, and
          here is the first fruit, in a work that is most
          admirably edited by the head of a family beloved
          and honoured in those breezy western isles, who
          has produced a book which will be equally prized
          in the nursery, in the drawing-room, and in the
          library.‚Äù--_Times, November 5th._

          ‚ÄúAlighting on a book that has discoveries in
          it is pretty nearly as good as making the
          discoveries for one‚Äôs self. In either case,
          there is an impulse to come forward and let the
          fact be known, lest some other should be the
          first to make the revelation. It is thus that we
          are tempted, with more than usual promptitude,
          to notice this book, which contains valuable
          and striking novelties from an untrodden
          arch√¶ological ground.... That something might be
          found in the west had been hinted, in accounts
          of some curious relics, by Professor Innes
          and his friend, Dr. Reeves, but it has fallen
          to the author of the present volume to go
          thoroughly to work and excavate the neglected
          treasure.‚Äù--_Scotsman, April 24._

     The Story of Burnt Njal; or, Life in Iceland at the
          end of the Tenth Century. From the Icelandic of
          the Njals Saga. By G. W. DASENT, D.C.L. In 2
          vols. 8vo, with Maps and Plans, price 28s.

          ‚ÄúConsidered as a picture of manners, customs,
          and characters, the Njala has a merit equal
          in our eyes to that of the Homeric poems
          themselves.‚Äù--_Edinburgh Review, October 1861._

          ‚ÄúThe majority of English readers would have been
          surprised to be told that in the literature of
          Iceland there was preserved a story of life and
          manners in the heroic age, which for simple
          force and truthfulness is, as far as we know,
          unequalled in European history and poetry, and
          is not unworthy of being compared, not indeed
          for its poetic richness and power, but for the
          insight which it gives into ancient society, with
          the Homeric poems.‚Äù--_Guardian, May 1._

          ‚ÄúA work, of which we gladly repeat the judgment
          of a distinguished American writer, that it is
          unsurpassed by any existing monument in the
          narrative department of any literature, ancient
          or modern.‚Äù--_Saturday Review._

          ‚ÄúAn historical romance of the tenth century,
          first narrated almost at the very time and by
          the very people to whom it refers, nearly true
          as to essential facts, and quite true in its
          pictures of the customs and the temper of the
          old Norsemen, about whom it tells, is in these
          volumes edited with the soundest scholarship by
          Dr. Dasent. There was need of a thorough study of
          the life and language of the early colonists of
          Iceland for the effective setting forth of this
          Njala, or saga of Njal.‚Äù--_Examiner, March 30._

          ‚ÄúThis ‚ÄôStory of Burnt Njal‚Äô is worthy of the
          translator of the Norse Tales: a work of
          interest to the antiquary and the lover of
          legendary lore--that is, to every one capable of
          appreciating those sources of history which are
          at once the most poetic and the most illustrative
          of the character and growth of nations. The
          events of the story happened while the conflict
          of the two creeds of Christ and Odin was yet
          going on in the minds of the Northmen. We must
          pass the book over to the reader‚Äôs attentive
          consideration, for there are few portions of
          it that are not pregnant with interest and
          instruction for a reflective mind.‚Äù--_Athen≈ìum._

          ‚ÄúHurriedly and imperfectly as we have traced the
          course of this tale divine, it must be evident to
          all who have accompanied us in our progress that
          there is real Homeric stuff in it. The Saga has a
          double value, an √¶sthetic and an historic value.
          Through it we may learn how men and women in
          Iceland, near a thousand years ago, lived, loved,
          and died.‚Äù--_Spectator, April 20._

          ‚ÄúMr. Dasent has given us a thoroughly faithful
          and accurate translation of the ‚ÄôNjala; or, the
          Story of Njal,‚Äô the longest and certainly the
          best of all the Icelandic Sagas. The style is
          that pure Saxon idiom with which the readers
          of his ‚ÄôNorse Popular Tales‚Äô are familiar. To
          the translation are prefixed disquisitions on
          Iceland; its religion, constitution, and public
          and private life; and the appendix contains a
          very amusing essay on piracy and the Vikings, the
          biography of Gunnhillda, the wicked queen of Eric
          of the Bloody-axe, king of Norway, and afterwards
          warder of Northumberland, and a disquisition on
          the old Icelandic currency.‚Äù--_Times, April 8._

          cloth, 5s.

          ‚ÄúThe volume before us is by a Mr. Dodds, with
          whose name we were not previously acquainted. His
          Lectures on the Covenanters were addressed to
          popular audiences, and they are calculated to be
          exceedingly popular.... They have merits of their
          own; they are in passages very eloquent; they
          are full of graphic touches; they appeal with no
          small success to our sympathies; and, though we
          cannot endorse the leading idea of the book, we
          must do it all honour as an advance upon previous
          ideas on the same subject.‚Äù--_Times._

          ‚ÄúThis is an excellent little book, written in a
          large-hearted, earnest, pious, and thoroughly
          manly spirit.... The style is forcible, graphic,
          and robust; now and then perhaps a little stiff,
          sometimes pseudo-rhetorical, but, in general,
          well suited to the subject.... These men,
          whatever be the reader‚Äôs prepossessions, are
          really worth reading about. There was manhood in

          ‚ÄúIt is since Scottish writers have abandoned the
          search of a lost political history, have dropped
          their enthusiasm for a timid and turbulent
          ecclesiastical history, and have been content
          to depict the domestic annals of the people, to
          enter their shops and their houses, to follow
          them in the streets and the fields, and to record
          their everyday life--their eating and their
          drinking, their dress, their pleasures, their
          marriages, their wealth and their science--that
          Scottish history has become an enticing study....
          In this new path none has been more active than
          Mr. Cosmo Innes.‚Äù--_Times, April 3._

          ‚ÄúThis is a valuable collection of materials,
          from which future historians of Scotland may
          extract a solid basis for many portions of their
          work.... This recapitulation of the contents of
          the volume before us shews that it is a treasury
          of valuable documents, from which may be framed
          a better domestic history of Scotland during the
          middle ages than we yet possess. It reveals many
          inner characteristics of a shrewd, enterprising
          yet cautious people, as they were floating
          down the stream of time to blend with their
          co-civic races in an amicable fusion of political
          interests.‚Äù--_Morning Post, April 8._

          ‚ÄúMr. INNES, who is favourably known to us as
          the author of a work entitled ‚ÄôScotland in the
          Middle Ages,‚Äô has attempted, in his ‚Äô_Sketches
          of Early Scotch History_,‚Äô to open up the still
          tangled wild of his country‚Äôs annals, down to a
          later period, joining modern thought and customs
          to medi√¶val beliefs and usages.... Of the home
          life in Scotland, Mr. Innes gives us some very
          attractive notices, passing in review no less
          than four collections of family documents--the
          Morton, the Breadalbane, the Cawdor, and the
          Kilravock papers. Abounding, as these papers
          do, in social illustrations, and sketching, as
          they do, the character and spirit of the age,
          the condition and customs of the people, they
          cannot fail to instruct and entertain. Touches
          of reality, pleasant bits of gossip, records of
          wind and weather, household doings and sayings,
          are all to be found scattered over these family
          papers.‚Äù--_Spectator, April 6._

          ... ‚ÄúThe length of our quotations prevents
          us from dwelling on the encomiums this work
          so really deserves. The charms of literary
          composition are hardly expected in antiquarian
          researches. Knowledge and judgment are more
          looked for, but how well Mr. Innes has combined
          acumen with the power of investing his subject
          with interest, the most casual inspection will
          prove. He has added an important volume to
          the literature of his country, and doubtless
          will have many followers in a branch of
          authorship which is at once instructive and
          amusing.‚Äù--_Glasgow Courier, March 28._

          ‚ÄúOne of the most amusing and original volumes

          pains to form correct opinions, and in many cases
          appears to have succeeded. But the external
          relations of so vast an empire are too important

          ‚ÄúMr. Scarth‚Äôs little work will modify the

          It is written from a new point of view, and in
          a new spirit; and the Chinese question is one
          with at least two sides. The point of view may be
          fixed in a few words by saying that a ‚ÄôBritish

          Rev. THOS. SOMERVILLE, Minister of Jedburgh, and
          one of His Majesty‚Äôs Chaplains. 1 vol. crown 8vo,
          price 9s.

          ‚ÄúHis book is eminently graphic and readable, and
          it is no mean proof of its singular excellence
          that, following so close in the wake of his more
          imposing friend, Dr. Somerville should be able to
          hold his own with perfect ease.... Such, then,
          are a few of the points of interest afforded by
          this curious work, which we accept as a most
          valuable addition to a most interesting species
          of literature. The style of the book is flowing
          and graceful; the spirit of it refined and
          genial. It is excellently edited by a man who
          knows when to speak and when to be silent--when a
          foot-note is required and when it is not. We may
          expect that such a book will become a favourite
          among those who read for amusement, and, endowed
          as it is with a careful index, a standard work
          of reference to those who are in search of
          facts.--TIMES, MAY 24.

          ‚ÄúIt excels in what we most of all desire in a
          novel--freshness.... There is in some passages
          a good deal of pathos in it; and a writer
          who is capable of pathos--not mere maudlin,
          but genuine, manly feeling--belongs to the
          higher ranks of authorship. Many men have true
          tenderness of feeling, but, perhaps, the rarest
          thing in literature is the art of expressing
          this tenderness without being ridiculous, and
          of drawing tears of which the reader is not
          ashamed. Our author has not much indulged his
          faculty in this way but in one little scene--the
          deathbed of the elder Cosmo‚Äôs mother. He has been
          so successful that one cannot help feeling his
          superiority.‚Äù--_Times, January 10th._

          ‚ÄúTo call it merely a good novel is to do
          an injustice to the narrator, to say that
          it is the best of the season would not be
          absolutely correct, but would not be far from
          the truth. Every one should read it--all who
          read it will heartily recommend it to their
          friends.‚Äù--_Morning Herald, February 2d._

          ‚ÄúWe lay down the book gratefully and lovingly.
          To read of such a life is refreshing, and
          strengthening, and inspiring. It is long since
          we read any biography with equal pleasure;
          and assured of its general acceptance, we
          pass it on to our readers with our heartiest
          commendation.‚Äù--_The Scottish Press._
