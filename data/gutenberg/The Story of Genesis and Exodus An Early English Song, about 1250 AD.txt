PREFACE.


DESCRIPTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT, ETC.

The Editor of the present valuable and interesting record of our old
English speech will, no doubt, both astonish and alarm his readers by
informing them that he has never seen the manuscript from which the work he
professes to edit has been transcribed.

But, while the truth must be told, the reader need not entertain the
slightest doubt or distrust as to the accuracy and faithfulness of the
present edition; for, in the first place, the text was copied by Mr F. J.
Furnivall, an experienced editor and a zealous lover of Old English lore;
and, secondly, the proof sheets have been most carefully read with the
manuscript by the Rev. W. W. Skeat, who has spared no pains to render the
text an accurate copy of the original.[1] I have not been satisfied with
merely the general accuracy of the text, but all _doubtful_ or _difficult_
passages have been most carefully referred to, and compared with the
manuscript, so that the more questionable a word may appear, either as
regards its _form_ or _meaning_, the more may the reader rest assured of
its correctness, so that he may be under no apprehension that he is
perplexed by any typographical error, but feel confident that he is dealing
with the reading of the original copy.

The editorial portion of the present work includes the punctuation,
marginal analysis, conjectural readings, a somewhat large body of
annotations on the text of the poem, and a Glossarial Index, which, it is
hoped, will be found to be complete, as well as useful for reference.

The Corpus manuscript[2] is a small volume (about 8 in. √ó 4¬Ω in.), bound in
vellum, written on parchment in a hand of about 1300 A.D., with several
final long ≈ø's, and consisting of eighty-one leaves. Genesis ends on fol.
49_b_; Exodus has the last two lines at the top of fol. 81_a_.

The writing is clear and regular; the letters are large, but the words are
often very close together. Every initial letter has a little dab of red on
it, and they are mostly capitals, except the _b_, the _f_, the _√∞_, and
sometimes other letters. Very rarely, however, _B_, _F_, and _√ê_ are found
as initial letters.

The illuminated letters are simply large vermilion letters without
ornament, and are of an earlier form than the writing of the rest of the
manuscript. Every line ends with a full stop (or metrical point), except,
very rarely, when omitted by accident. Whenever this stop occurs in the
middle of a line it has been marked thus (.) in the text.


DESCRIPTION OF THE POEM.

Our author, of whom, unfortunately, we know nothing, introduces his subject
to his readers by telling them that they ought to love a rhyming story
which teaches the "layman" (though he be learned in no books) how to love
and serve God, and to live peaceably and amicably with his fellow
Christians. His poem, or "song," as he calls it, is, he says, turned out of
Latin into English speech; and as birds are joyful to see the dawning, so
ought Christians to rejoice to hear the "true tale" of man's fall and
subsequent redemption related in the vulgar tongue ("land's speech"), and
in easy language ("small words").

So eschewing a "high style" and all profane subjects, he declares that he
will undertake to sing no other song, although his present task should
prove unsuccessful.[3] Our poet next invokes the aid of the Deity for his
song in the following terms:‚Äî

 "Fader god of alle √∞hinge,
  Almigtin louerd, hege≈øt kinge,
  √∞u giue me ≈øeli timinge
  To thaunen √∞is werdes biginninge,
  √∞e, leuerd god, to wur√∞inge,
  Que√∞er ≈øo hic rede or ≈øinge!"[4]

Then follows the Bible narrative of Genesis and Exodus, here and there
varied by the introduction of a few of those sacred legends so common in
the medi√¶val ages, but in the use of which, however, our author is far less
bold than many subsequent writers, who, seeking to make their works
attractive to the "lewed," did not scruple to mix up with the sacred
history the most absurd and childish stories, which must have rendered such
compilations more amusing than instructive. It seems to have been the
object of the author of the present work to present to his readers, in as
few words as possible, the most important facts contained in the Books of
Genesis and Exodus without any elaboration or comment, and he has,
therefore, omitted such facts as were not essentially necessary to the
completeness of his narrative;[5] while, on the other hand, he has included
certain portions of the Books of Numbers and Deuteronomy,[6] so as to
present to his readers a complete history of the wanderings of the
Israelites, and the life of Moses their leader.

In order to excite the reader's curiosity, we subjoin a few passages, with
a literal translation:‚Äî


LAMECH'S BIGAMY.


  Lamech is at √∞e sexte kne,
  √∞e ≈øeuende man after adam,
  √∞at of caymes kinde cam.
  √∞i≈ø lamech wa≈ø √∞e firme man,
  √∞e bigamie fir≈øt bi-gan.
  Bigamie is unkinde √∞ing,
  On engleis tale, twie-wifing;
  for ai was rigt and kire bi-forn,
  On man, on wif, til he was boren.
  Lamech him two wifes nam,
  On adda, an no√∞er wif ≈øellam.
  Adda bar him ≈øune Iobal,
  He was hirde wittere and wal;
  Of merke, and kinde, and helde, & ble,
  ≈øundring and ≈øameni[n]g tagte he;
  Iobal i≈ø bro√∞er ≈øong and glew,
  Wit of mu≈øike, wel he knew;
  On two table≈ø of tigel and bra≈ø
  wrot he √∞at wi≈øtom, wi≈ø he was,
  √∞at it ne ≈øulde ben undon
  If fier or water come √∞or-on.
  Sella wune√∞ oc lamech wi√∞,
  ghe bar tubal, a ≈øellic ≈ømi√∞;
  Of irin, of golde, ≈øiluer, and bras
  To ≈øundren and mengen wi≈ø he was;
  Wopen of wigte and tol of gri√∞,
  Wel cu√∞e egte and ≈øafgte wi√∞.



  Lamech is at the sixth degree,
  The seventh man after Adam,
  That of Cain's kin came.
  This Lamech was the first man
  Who bigamy first began.
  Bigamy is unnatural thing,
  In English speech, twi-wiving;
  For aye was right and purity before,
  One man, one wife, till he was born.
  Lamech to him two wives took,
  One Adah, another wife Zillah.
  Adah bare him a son Jubal,
  He was a [shep-]herd wise and able;
  Of mark,[7] breed, age, and colour,
  Separating and assembling taught he;
  Jubal his brother poetry and music,
  Craft of music, well he knew;
  On two tables of tile and brass,
  Wrote he that wisdom, wise he was,
  That it should not be effaced
  If fire or water came thereon.
  Zillah dwelleth also Lamech with,
  She bare Tubal, a wonderful smith;
  Of iron, of gold, silver and brass
  To separate and mix, wise he was;
  Weapon of war and tool of peace,
  Well could he hurt and heal with.
  ‚Äî(ll. 444-470.)


DEATH OF CAIN.


  Lamech ledde long lif til √∞an
  √∞at he wur√∞ bi≈øne, and haued a man
  √∞at ledde him ofte wude≈ø ner,
  To scheten after √∞e wilde der;
  Al-so he mi≈øtagte, al≈øo he ≈øchet,
  And caim in √∞e wude i≈ø let;
  His knape wende it were a der,
  An lamech droge i≈ø arwe ner,
  And letet flegen of √∞e ≈øtreng,
  Caim unwar[_n_]de it under-feng,
  Gru≈ønede, and ≈øtrekede, and ≈øtarf wi√∞-√∞an.
  Lamech wi√∞ wre√∞e i≈ø knape nam,
  Vn-bente i≈ø boge, and bet, and slog,
  Til he fel dun on dede≈ø ≈øwog.
  Twin-wifing and twin-man≈ølagt,
  Of his ≈øoule be√∞ mikel hagt.



  Lamech led long life till then
  That he became blind and had a man
  That led him oft to woods near,
  To shoot after the wild deer (animals);
  As he mistaught, so he shot,
  And Cain in the wood is let;
  His knave (servant) weened it were a deer,
  And Lamech drew his arrow near
  And let it fly off the string,
  Cain unwarned it received,
  Groaned, fell prostrate (stretched) and died with-that.
  Lamech with wrath his knave seized,
  Unbent his bow, and beat and slew,
  Till he fell down in death's swoon.
  Twi-wiving (bigamy) and twi-slaughter (double homicide)
  On his soul is great trouble (anxiety).
  ‚Äî(ll. 471-486.)


HOW THE CHILD MOSES BEHAVED BEFORE PHARAOH.


  Ghe brogte him bi-foren pharaon,
  And √∞i≈ø king wur√∞ him in herte mild,
  So ≈øwide faiger was √∞i≈ø child;
  And he toc him on ≈øunes ≈øtede,
  And hi≈ø corune on his heued he dede,
  And let it ≈øtonden ayne ≈øtund;
  √∞e child it warp dun to √∞e grund.
  Hamone≈ø likene≈ø was √∞or-on;
  √∞i≈ø crune is broken, √∞i≈ø i≈ø mi≈ødon.
  Bi≈ø≈øop Eliopoleos
  ≈øag √∞i≈ø timing, & up he ro≈ø;
 "If √∞i≈ø child," quad he, "mote √∞en,
  He ≈øal egyptes bale ben."
  If √∞or ne wore helpe twen lopen,
  √∞i≈ø childe adde √∞an ≈øone be dropen;
  √∞e king wi√∞-≈øtod & an wi≈ø man,
  He ≈øeide, "√∞e child do√∞ al≈ø he can;
  We ≈øulen nu witen for it dede
  √∞i≈ø witterlike, or in child-hede;"
  He bad √∞is child brennen to colen
  And he toc is (hu migt he it √∞olen),
  And in hi≈øe muth ≈øo depe he i≈ø dede
  Hi≈øe tunges ende i≈ø brent √∞or-mide;
  √∞or-fore ≈øeide √∞e ebru witterlike,
  √∞at he ≈øpac ≈øi√∞en mi≈øerlike.



  She (Thermutis) brought him (Moses) before Pharaoh,
  And this king became to him in heart mild,
  So very fair was this child;
  And he took him on son's stead (instead of a son),
  And his crown on his head he did (placed),
  And let it stand a stound (while);
  The child threw it down to the ground.
  Hamon's likeness was thereon;
  This crown is broken, this is misdone.
  The Bishop of Heliopolis
  Saw this circumstance, and up he rose;
  If this child, quoth he, might thrive (grow up),
  He shall Egypt's bale be.
  If there had not helpers 'tween leapt,
  This child had then soon been killed;
  The king with-stood and a wise man,
  He said, The child doth as he can (knows);
  We should now learn whether it did
  This wittingly, or in childishness;
  He offered this child two burning coals
  And he took them (how might he bear them?)
  And in his mouth so deep (far) he them did (placed)
  His tongue's end is burnt therewith;
  Therefore said the Hebrew truly,
  That he spake afterwards indistinctly.
  ‚Äî(ll. 2634-2658.)


HOW MOSES DEFEATED THE ETHIOPIANS.


  Bi √∞at time √∞at he was gu√∞,
  Wi√∞ faigered and ≈øtrengthe ku√∞,
  folc ethiopienes on egipte cam,
  And brende, & ≈ølug, & wreche nam,
  Al to memphin √∞at riche cite,
  And a-non to √∞e reade ≈øe;
  √∞o was egipte folc in dred,
  And a≈økeden here godes red;
  And hem ≈øeiden wi√∞ an≈øweren,
  √∞at on ebru cude hem wel weren.

  Moy≈øes was louered of √∞at here,
  √∞or he wur√∞ √∞ane egyptes were;
  Bi a lond weige he wente rigt,
  And brogte vn-warnede on hem figt;
  He hadden don egipte wrong,
  He bi-loc hem & ≈ømette a-mong,
  And ≈ølug √∞or manige; oc ≈øumme flen,
  Into ≈øaba to borgen ben.
  Moy≈øes bi-≈øette al √∞at burg,
  Oc it was riche & ≈øtrong ut-√∞hurg;
  Ethiopienes kinges dowter tarbis,
  Riche maiden of michel pri≈ø,
  Gaf √∞i≈ø riche burg moy≈øi;
  Luue-bonde hire ghe it dede for-√∞i.
  √∞or i≈øe fon he leide in bonde,
  And he wur√∞ al-migt-ful in √∞at lond;
  He bi-lef √∞or(.) tarbis him ≈øcro√∞,
  √∞og was him √∞at ≈øurgerun ful lo√∞;
  Mai he no leue at hire taken
  but-if he it mai wi√∞ crafte maken:
  He wa≈ø of an ≈øtrong migt [&] wi≈ø,
  He carf in two gummes of pri≈ø
  Two likene≈ø≈øes, ≈øo grauen & meten,

  He fe≈øt is in two ringes of gold,
  Gaf hire √∞e ton, he was hire hold;
  [And quan awei nimen he wolde
  Gaf hire √∞e to√∞er, he was hire colde]
  Ghe it bered and √∞i≈ø luue i≈ø for-geten,
  Moy≈øes √∞us haued him leue bi-geten;
  Sone it migte wi√∞ leue ben,
  Into egypte e wente a-gen.



  By that time that he was a youth (young man),
  For beauty and strength renowned,
  Ethiopian folk on Egypt came,
  And burnt, and slew, and vengeance took,
  All to Memphis that rich city,
  And anon to the Red Sea;
  Then was Egypt's folk in dread,
  And asked their gods' advice;
  And they said to them in answer,
  That one Hebrew could them well defend.

  Moses became leader of that (Egyptian) army,
  There he became then Egypt's protector;
  By a land-way he went right,
  And brought unwarned on them fight;
  They had done Egypt wrong,
  He compassed them and smote among,
  And slew there many; but some fled
  Into Sheba to be saved.
  Moses beset all that borough (city),
  But it was rich and strong out-thorough (throughout);
  Tarbis, the Ethiopian king's daughter,
  Rich maiden of great renown,
  Gave this rich city to Moses;
  As love-bond's hire she did it, therefore.
  There his foes he laid in bond,
  And he became all-powerful in that land;
  He remained there, Tarbis him urged,
  Yet was to him that sojourn full loath;
  May he no leave of her take
  Unless he it may with craft make:
  He was of a strong might and wise,
  He carved in two gems (stones) precious,
  Two likenesses alike carved and depicted,
  This one causes to remember, and the other to forget;
  He fastened them in two rings of gold,
  Gave her the one, he was dear to her;
  [And when depart he would
  Gave her the other, and was distasteful to her]
  She it beareth and this love is forgotten,
  Moses thus hath for himself leave begotten;
  Soon it might with leave be,
  Into Egypt he went again.
  ‚Äî(ll. 2665-2708.)


THE PLAGUE OF FROGS.


  And aaron held up his hond

  √∞o cam √∞or up ≈øwilc fro≈økes here
  √∞e dede al folc egipte dere;

  And √∞o hem deden √∞e mo≈øte ≈øame;

  Summe ≈øtoruen and gouen ≈øtinc,
  And vn-hileden mete and drinc;
  Polheuedes, and fro≈økes, & podes ≈øpile
  Bond harde egipte folc un-≈øile.[8]



  And Aaron held up his hand
  To the water and the greater land;
  Then came there up such host of frogs
  That did all Egypt's folk harm;
  Some were wild, and some tame,
  And those caused them the most (greatest) shame;
  In house, in drink, in meats, in bed,
  They crept and made them in great dread;
  Some died and gave (out) stink,
  And (others) uncovered meat and drink;
  Tadpoles and frogs, and toad's venom
  Bound hard Egypt's sorrowful folk.
  ‚Äî(ll. 2967-2978.)

The reader must not be disappointed if he fails to find many traces in this
work of our pious author's poetic skill; he must consider that the interest
attaching to so early an _English_ version of Old Testament History, as
well as the philological value of the poem, fully compensates him for the
absence of great literary merit, which is hardly to be expected in a work
of this kind. And, moreover, we must recollect that it is to the
patriotism, as well as piety, of such men as our author, that we owe the
preservation of our noble language. The number of religious treatises
written in English during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries proves
that the dialect of religion approached more closely to the speech of the
people than did the language of history or romance. And it is a curious
fact that the most valuable monuments of our language are mostly
theological, composed for the lewed and unlearned, who knew no other
language than the one spoken by their forefathers, and who clung most
tenaciously to their mother tongue, notwithstanding the changes consequent
upon the Norman invasion, and the oppression of Norman rule, which,
inasmuch as it fostered and kept up a patriotic spirit, exercised a most
important and beneficial influence upon Early English literary culture and
civilization.


DATE AND DIALECT OF THE POEM.

The mere examination of an Early English work with respect to its
vocabulary and grammatical forms, will not enable us (as Price asserts) to
settle satisfactorily the date at which it was written. The place of
composition must also be taken into consideration, and a comparison, if
possible, must be made with other works in the same dialect, the date of
which is known with some degree of certainty. The date of the text before
us must not, therefore, be confounded with that of the manuscript, which
is, perhaps, a few years earlier than A.D. 1300. A careful comparison of
the poem with the Bestiary, written in the same dialect, and most probably
by the same author[9] (and printed by Mr Wright in the Reliqui√¶ Antiqu√¶, p.
208, and by myself in an Old English Miscellany), leads me to think that
the present poem is not later than A.D. 1250.[10]

The vocabulary, which contains very few words of Romance origin,[11] is not
that of Robert of Gloucester, or of Robert of Brunne, but such as is found
in La»ùamon's Brut, or Orm's paraphrases, and other works illustrating the
second period of our language, i.e. the twelfth and earlier part of the
thirteenth centuries.

The employment of a _dual_ for the pronouns of the first and second persons
marks an _early_ date (certainly not much later than the time of Henry
III.) even in works composed in the Southern dialect, which, it is well
known, retained to a comparatively late period those Anglo-Saxon
inflections that had long previously been disused in more Northern
dialects.

The Corpus manuscript is evidently the work of a scribe, to whom the
language was more or less archaic, which accounts for such blunders as
_√∞rosing_ for _√∞rosem_, _waspene_ for _wastme_, _lage_ for _vn-lage_,
_insile_ for _vn-sile_, _grauen_ for _√∞rauen_, etc.

The original copy of Genesis most probably terminated with ll. 2521-4:

 "And here ended completely
  The book which is called Genesis,
  Which Moses, through God's help,
  Wrote for precious souls' need."

The concluding lines, in which both the author and scribe are mentioned,
seem to me to be the work of a subsequent transcriber:

 "God shield his soul from hell-bale,
  Who made it thus in English tale (speech)!
  And he that these letters wrote,
  May God help him blissfully,
  And preserve his soul from sorrow and tears,
  Of hell-pain, cold and hot!"

The Ormulum is the earliest[12] printed Early English work which has come
down to us that exhibits the uniform employment of the termination _-en_
(_-n_) as the inflection of the plural number, present tense, indicative
mood; or, in other words, it is the earliest printed example we have of a
_Midland_ dialect. I say _a_ Midland dialect, because the work of Orm is,
after all, only a specimen of _one_ variety of the Midland speech, most
probably of that spoken in the northern part of the eastern counties of
England, including what is commonly called the district of East Anglia.

Next in antiquity to the Ormulum come the Bestiary, already mentioned, and
the present poem, both of which uniformly employ the Midland affix _-en_,
to the exclusion of all others, as the inflection of the present plural
indicative.

There are other peculiarities which these works have in common; and a
careful comparison of them with the Ormulum induces me to assign them to
the East Midland area; but there are certain peculiarities, to be noticed
hereafter, which induce me to believe that the work of Orm represents a
dialect spoken in the northern part of this district, while the Story of
Genesis and Exodus, together with the Bestiary, exhibits the speech of the
more southern counties of the East Midland district.[13] Thus, if the
former be in the dialect of _Lincoln_, the latter is in that of
_Suffolk_.[14]

The chief points in which the present poem and the Bestiary agree with the
Ormulum are the following:‚Äî

I. The absence of compound vowels.

In the Southern dialects we find the compound vowels _ue_, _eo_, _ie_, _ea_
(_yea_). In the Ormulum _eo_ occurs, but with the sound of _e_, and _ea_ in
Genesis and Exodus is written for _e_.

II. The change of an initial _√∞_ (th) into _t_ after words ending in _d_,
_t_, _n_, _s_, that is to say, after a dental or a sibilant.[15]

 "√∞anne i≈ø _tis_ fruit wel ≈øwi√∞e good."‚Äî(_Gen. and Ex._, l. 334.)

 "√∞e fir≈øt moned and _te_ fir≈øt dai,
  He ≈øag er√∞e drie & _te_ water awai."‚Äî(_Ibid._, l. 615-6.)

 "√∞in berg and _tin_ werger ic ham."‚Äî(_Ibid._, l. 926.)

 "at _te_ welle[n]."‚Äî(_Ibid._, l. 2756.)

This practice is much more frequent in the Bestiary, which is a proof,
perhaps, that the present poem has suffered somewhat in the course of
transcription.

 "neddre is _te_ name."‚Äî(_O.E. Miscellany_, p. 5.)

 "it is _te_ ned."‚Äî(_Ibid._, p. 6.)

 "√∞is lif bitokne√∞ √∞e sti
  √∞at _te_ neddre gange√∞ bi,
  and _tis_ is √∞e √∞irl of √∞e ston,
  √∞at _tu_ salt √∞urg gon."‚Äî(_Ibid._, p. 7.)

 "at _tin_ herte."‚Äî(_Ibid._, p. 7.)

III. Simplicity of grammatical structure and construction of sentences.[16]

1. The neglect of _gender_ and _number_ in nouns.

2. The genitive singular of substantives end in _-es_ in all genders.[17]

3. The absence of the gen. pl. of substantives in _-ene_.

4. The employment of an uninflected article.[18]

5. The use of _√∞at_ (that) as a demonstrative adjective, and not as the
neuter of the article. The form _√∞as_ (those), common enough in the
fourteenth century, does not occur in this poem or in the Ormulum.

6. No inflection of the adjective in the accusative singular. The phrase
'_godun_ dai,' good day, in l. 1430, p. 41, contains a solitary instance of
the accusative of the adjective, but it is, no doubt, a mere remnant of the
older speech, just like our 'for _the n_once' (= for _then_ once), and is
no proof that the writer or his readers employed it as a common inflection.
The form _godun_ is a corruption of _godne_, as it is more properly written
in works in the Southern dialects as late as the middle of the fourteenth
century.

7. Adjectives and adverbs with the termination _-like_.

The Southern form is, for adjectives, _-lich_ (sing.), _-liche_ (pl.); for
adverbs _-liche_. Thus the adoption of this affix really (though at first
it appears a matter of no importance) marks a _stage_ in the language when
the distinction between the sing. and pl. form of adjectives was not very
strictly observed, and was, moreover, a step towards our modern _-ly_,
which is adjectival as well as adverbial.

Even in this poem adjectives occur in _-li_, as _reuli_ = piteous, which is
the earliest example I have met with. Orm employs double forms in _-like_
and _-li»ù»ù_ (= _ly_?). _-ly_ has arisen not out of _-lich_ or _-liche_
(which would have become _lidge_ or _litch_), but out of some such softened
form as _li»ù_.

8. The tendency to drop the initial _y_, _i_ (A.S. _ge_) of the passive
participles of strong verbs.

The Ormulum has two or three examples of this prefixal element, and in our
poem it occurs but seldom.

IV. A tendency to drop the _t_ of the second person of verbs, as _as_,
hast; _beas_, be√´st; _findes_, findest.

Examples of this practice are very common in the Bestiary and Genesis and
Exodus, but it occurs only four times in the Ormulum.[19] It was very
common for the West-Midland to drop the _-e_ of 2nd person in strong verbs.
See Preface to O.E. Homilies, 1st Series.

V. The use of _arn_, _aren_, for _ben_ of the Midland dialect, or _be√∞_ of
the Southern dialect.[20]

VI. The employment of the adverbs _thethen_, _hethen_, _quethen_ (of
Scandinavian origin),[21] instead of the Southern _thenne_ (_thennen_),
thence; _henne_ (_hennen_), hence; _whanne_ (_whanene_), whence.

VII. The use of _oc_, _ok_ (also, and), a form which does not occur in any
specimen of a Southern, West-Midland, or Northern dialect that has come
under my notice. The use of _on_, _o_, for the Southern _an_ or _a_, as
_onlike_, _olike_, alike, _on-rum_, apart, _on-sunder_, asunder, is also
worth noticing.

VIII. The coalition of the pronoun _it_ with pronouns and verbs, as _get_
(Bestiary) = she it (_»ùh√∂t_ in Ormulum; cf. _√æ√ºt_ = _thu itt_, thou it);
_tellet_ = tell it; _wuldet_ = would it; _ist_ = is it, is there; _wast_,
was it, was there, etc. _√æit_ = _√æe_ + _hit_ = who it, occurs in O.E.
Homilies, 2nd Series.

The Ormulum, the Bestiary, and Genesis and Exodus have some few other
points of agreement which will be found noticed in the Grammatical Details
and Glossary. There are, however, grammatical forms in the latter works
which do not present themselves in the former, and which, in my opinion,
seem to indicate a more Southern origin. (See Preface to O.E. Homilies, 2nd
Series.)

I. Plurals in _n_.

I do not recollect any examples of plurals in _n_ in the Ormulum, except
_ehne_, eyes; in this poem we have _colen_, coals; _deden_, deeds; _fon_,
foes; _si√∞en_, sides; _son_, shoes; _steden_, places; _sunen_, sons;
_tren_, trees; _teten_, teats; _wunen_, laws, abilities, etc. (see p.
xxii.)

II. The pronoun _is_ (_es_) = them.[22] In the fourteenth century we only
find this form _is_ (_hise_) in pure _Southern_ writers.[23]

 "Diep he _i≈ø_ dalf under an ooc."[24]‚Äî(_Gen. and Ex._, l. 1873, p. 54.)

 "For ≈øalamon findin _i≈ø_ ≈øal."[25]‚Äî(_Ibid._, l. 1877, p. 54.)

 "He toc _i≈ø_."[26]‚Äî(_Ibid._, l. 2654, p. 76.)


 "Alle hise fet steppes
   After him he fille√∞,
   Drage√∞ dust wi√∞ his stert
  (_O.E. Miscell._, p. 1.)

  √∞er he steppe√∞,
  O√∞er dust o√∞er deu,
  √∞at he ne cunne _is_ finden."[27]



Our author, however, employs this curious pronoun in a way quite peculiar
to himself, for he constantly joins it to a _pronoun_ or a _verb_,[28] and
the compound was at first rather perplexing. _Hes_ = _he_ + _is_, he, them;
_wes_ = _we_ + _is_, we, them;[29] _caldes_, called them; _dedis_, did
(placed) them; _settes_, set them; _wroutis_, wrought them, etc.

 "Alle _hes_ hadde wi√∞ migte bi-geten."[30]‚Äî(_Gen. and Ex._, l. 911, p.
      26.)

 "Vndelt _he≈ø_ leide quor-so _he≈ø_ tok."[31]‚Äî(_Ibid._, l. 943, p. 27.)

 "√êe culuer haue√∞ costes gode,
  alle _wes_ ogen to hauen in mode."[32]‚Äî(_O.E. Miscell._, p. 25.)

 "Bala two childre bar bi him,
  Rachel _caldes_ dan(.) neptalim;
  And zelfa two sunes him ber,
  Lia _calde is_(.) Gad(.) and asser."[33]‚Äî(_Gen. and Ex._, l. 1700, p.
      49.)

 "√∞e tabernacle he _dedis_ in."[34]‚Äî(_Ibid._, l. 3830, p. 109.)

 "He _settes_ in √∞e firmament."[35]‚Äî(_Ibid._, l. 135, p. 5.)

In the Kentish Ayenbite of 1340 _he_ never coalesces with _hise_ (them),
_e.g._:‚Äî

  "He (the devil) is lye»ùere and vader of leazinges, ase he √æet made √æe
  verste leazinge, and yet _he hise_ make√æ and tek√æ eche daye."‚Äî(Ayenbite
  of Inwyt, p. 47.)

  (He is a liar and the father of leasings, as he that made the first
  leasing, and yet _he them_, i.e. lies, maketh and teacheth each day.)

In Old Kentish Sermons (Old Eng. Miscell p. 28) _has_ = _ha_ + _es_ = he
them.

III. The pronoun _he_, they (Southern _hii_, _heo_; Northumbrian _thay_).
Orm uses _√æe»ù»ù_, as well as _√æe»ù»ùer_ (their), _√æe»ù»ùm_ (them).[36]

IV. _hine_, _hin_, _in_ = him. This form occurs as late as 1340, and still
exists under the form _en_, _un_, in the modern dialects of the South of
England, but is not employed by Orm; nor do we find any traces of _whan_
(whom), another very common example of the _-n_ accusative inflection,
either in the Ormulum or the present work.

V. The substitution of _n_ for a vowel-ending in nouns. Dr Guest has
noticed this peculiarity, but he confines this substitution to the
_nominative_ case of nouns of the _n_ declension,[37] and to the definite
form of the adjective, which has, no doubt, given rise to the O.E.
_himseluen_, etc., _bothen_ (both), as well as, perhaps, to _ouren_ (ours),
_heren_ (theirs), etc.

In the present poem, however, the _n_ seems added to the vowel-ending of
all cases except the possessive, in order to rhyme with a verb in the
infinitive, a passive participle, or an adverb terminating in _-en_, and is
not always limited to nouns of the _-n_ declension, but represents in A.S.
an _a_ or _e_: 'on _boken_,'[38] on book, l. 4; 'on _so√∞e-sagen_,' on
sooth-saw, l. 14; _meten_, (acc.) meat, l. 2255, (nom.) 2079; _sunen_,
(nom.) son, l. 1656; 'of _luuen_,' of love, 635; 'after √∞e _wunen_' (after
the custom), l. 688; _steden_, (nom.) place, 1114; 'for _on-sagen_,' for
reproach, 2045; _wliten_, (nom.) face, 3614, (acc.) 2289; 'wi√∞ _answeren_,'
in answer, 2673; _bileuen_, (acc.) remainder, 3154; _uuerslagen_, (acc.)
lintel, 3155.

Dr Guest considers this curious nunnation to be a Northern peculiarity, but
as we do not meet with it (as far as I know) in any Northumbrian work, his
statement is rather doubtful. On the other hand, it is well known that the
plurals _bretheren_ (_bro√∞eren_[39] in Shoreham), _calveren_[40] (calves),
_children_,[41] _doren_ (doors),[42] _eyren_ (eggs),[43] _honden_
(hands),[44] _kine_,[45] _lambren_ (lambs),[46] _soulen_ (souls)‚Äîvery
common forms in the _Southern_ dialects in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries‚Äîare examples of the substitution of _n_ for, or in addition to,
the vowel-ending, and were unknown in the Northern dialect.

The Southern dialect could drop or retain, at pleasure, the _n_ final in
the past participles, the preterite plurals, and infinitive mood of verbs.

VI. A very small Norse element in the vocabulary.

The only words of undoubtedly Norse element that occur in the present poem,
and were unknown to Southern English, are‚Äî_fro_ (from), _ille_ (bad),
_for-swe√∞en_ (to burn), _flitten_ (to remove), _la√∞e_ (barn), _lowe_
(flame), _mirk_ (dark), _ransaken_ (to search), _swa√∞e_ (flame), _til_
(to), _uglike_ (horrible), _werre_ (worse).[47]

The Ormulum, being more Northern, contains a _larger_ number of words that
must be referred to one of the Scandinavian idioms:[48]‚Äî_afell_ (strength),
_afledd_ (begotten), _be»ù»ùsc_ (bitter), *_blunnt_ (blunt, dull), _bracc_
(noise), *_bra√æ_ (angry), *_bra√æ√æe_ (anger), *_brodd_ (shoot), _brodden_
(to sprout), _bro√æ√æfall_ (fit), *_bun_ (ready, _bound_), *_clake_
(accusation), *_croc_ (device), *_derf_ (bold), *_dill_ (sluggish),
*_eggenn_ (to urge, egg on), *_egginng_ (urging), *_ettle_, *_flittenn_ (to
remove, flit), *_flitting_ (change, removal), *_forrgart_ (opposed,
condemned), *_forrgloppned_ (disturbed with fear, astonishment), *_gate_
(way), _gowesst_ (watchest), *_ha»ùherr_ (dexterous), _ha»ùherle»ù»ùc_ (skill),
*_ha»ùherrlike_ (fitly), _hof_ (moderation), _hofel√¶s_ (immoderately),
*_ille_ (bad), *_immess_ (variously), *_kinndlenn_ (to kindle), *_lasst_
(crime, fault), _le»ùhe_ (hire, pay), *_le»ù»ùtenn_ (O.E. _layte_, inquire,
seek), _o-loft_ (aloft), *_lo»ùhe_ (fire), *_mune_ (must, will), _na√æe_
(grace), _nowwt_ (cattle, O.N. _naut_; the Southern form is _neet_, _nete_,
A.S. _ne√°t_), *_ploh_ (plough), *_radd_ (afraid), *_ros_ (praise), *_rosen_
(to boast), *_rosinng_ (boast), _rowwst_ (voice), *_scaldess_ (poets, O.E.
_scald_, a great talker, boaster, E. _scold_), *_sit_ (pain), *_sket_
(quickly), *_skirpe√æ√æ_ (rejecteth), *_slo√æ_ (track, path), _smikerr_
(beautiful, Eng. _smug_), _soww√æess_ (sheep), _stoffnedd_ (generated, O.E.
_stoven_, trunk, stem), *_summ_ (as), *_till_ (to), *_t√≥r_ (hard,
difficult), *_trigg_ (true), _uppbrixle_ (object of reproach, O.E.
_brixle_, reproach), _usell_ (wretched), *_wand_ (rod), *_wandra√æ_, O.E.
_wandreth_ (trouble), *_werre_ (worse).

As most, if not all, of the words in the foregoing list are not found in
works written in the Southern dialect,‚Äîso far as we at present know them‚Äîwe
may reasonably suppose that they indicate fairly the Danish element in the
English literature of the 12th and 13th centuries. In the Northumbrian, and
the West, and East-Midland productions of a century later this element
prevails to a much larger extent, and Herbert Coleridge's list of such
words may be largely increased (Phil. Soc. Trans., 1859, p. 26-30).


GRAMMATICAL DETAILS.


I. NOUNS.

1. _Number._‚ÄîThe plural is generally formed by adding _-es_ to the
singular. Some few nouns make the plural in _-en_, as _feren_[49]
(companions), _fon_ (foes), _goren_ (spears), _loten_ (features), _sunen_
(sons), _teten_ (teats), _tren_ (trees), _weden_ (garments), _wunen_
(laws). The plurals of _brother_ and _child_ are _brethere_ and _childere_.
_Der_ (deer), _erf_, _orf_ (cattle), _got_ (goat), _neat_ (oxen), _sep_
(sheep), _scrud_ (garbs), _wrim_ (reptiles), of the neuter gender, are
uninflected in the plural. _Winter_, _ger_ (year), and _nigt_ (night), are
plural as in Anglo-Saxon.

2. _Gender._‚ÄîAs a general rule the names of inanimate things are of the
neuter gender. The names of towns, however, are considered as masculine.

3. _Case._‚ÄîThe genitive singular and plural of masculine and feminine nouns
end in _-es_. Occasionally proper nouns form the genitive in _-is_. The
means or instrument occasionally stands in the genitive without the
preposition: '_deades_ driuen,' influenced by death; '_swerdes_ slagen,'
slain of the sword; '_teres_ wet,' wet with tears. Cf. '_floures bred_,'
bread made with flour; '_bredes_ mel,' meal consisting of bread; '_wines_
drinc,' drink consisting of wine.

Corresponding to the modern word _kinsmen_ we have such forms as
'_daiges-ligt_' (daylight), '_hines-folk_' (servants), '_wifeskin_'
(women). The genitive is used adverbially, as _newes_, anew; _liues_,
alive.

We have a few traces of the genitive in _-e_ in the following examples:
'_helle_ nigt,' l. 89 (hell's night); '_helle_ bale,' l. 2525 (hell's
bale); '_sterre_ name,' l. 134 (star's name); '_safte_ same,' l. 349 (shame
of form); '_werlde_ nigt,' l. 1318 (world's night).[50]

The genitive of _fader_ and _moder_ is, as is very seldom the case in Early
English writers, _fadres_ and _modres_.

An _n_ is often added to the final _-e_ (representing an A.Sax.
vowel-ending) in the nom., dat., and acc. of nouns. For examples, see p.
xxi.


II. ADJECTIVES.

1. Adjectives have a definite and an indefinite form; the former is used
when the adjective is preceded by the definite article, a demonstrative
adjective, or possessive pronoun.

  Indef. _wis_ (wise),    _god_ (good).
  Def.   _wise_,          _gode_.

2. _Number._‚ÄîThe plural is formed by the addition of _e_ to the singular.

  SINGULAR.        PLURAL.
  _fet_ (fat),     _fette_.
  _gret_ (great)   _grete_.
  _other_,         _othere_.
  _tother_,        _tothere_.

But the _-e_ (pl.) is seldom added to the past participle of irregular
verbs. _This_ forms the plurals _thes_ (oblique cases _these_), _this_
(_thise_). _Tho_ is the plural of _that_.

_Cases._‚Äî_One_ makes the genitive _ones_; as, '_ones_ bles,' of one colour.
The gen. pl. _-re_ occurs in _ald-re_ (= _alre_), of all; as, 'hure _aldre_
bale,' the bale of us all; 'here _aldre_ heuedes,' the heads of them all.

_Degrees of comparison._‚ÄîThe comparative ends in _-ere_ (_-er_), the
superlative in _-este_ (_est_).[51] Very few irregular forms occur in the
present poem.

  POSITIVE.   COMPARATIVE.   SUPERLATIVE.
    ille,        werre.         ‚Äî‚Äî
    lite,        lesse,         leist.
    long,      { leng.    }     ‚Äî‚Äî
               { lengere. }
    mikel,     { mo,  }         moste.
               { mor, }
    neg,         ‚Äî‚Äî             neste.
    old,         eldere,        eldeste.

_Numerals._‚ÄîThe Northumbrian forms in _-nde_ have superseded the Southern
ones in _-the_; as, _seuende_ (seventh), _egtende_ (eighth), _tende_
(tenth).[52]


III. PRONOUNS.

1. The first personal pronoun _Ic_ is never found softened into _Ich_ as in
La»ùamon's Brut, the Ancren Riwle, and other Southern works. _I_ is found
only once or twice throughout the poem.

2. The first and second personal pronouns have a _dual_ as well as a plural
number; as, _wit_, we two; _unc_, us two; _gunc_, you two; _gunker_, of you
two.

3. _Hine_ (_hin_, _in_) (acc.) occasionally occurs, but more frequently
_him_ (dat.) does duty for it.

4. _Ge_, _ghe_,[53] she, represents the A.Sax. _h√©o_ (O.E. _heo_, _ho_, and
_hi_). The curious form _sge_ (= _sye_), as well as _sche_, occurs for she,
the earliest instance of which is _sc√¶_ in the A.Sax. Chronicle.

5. The neuter pronoun is written _it_ and not _hit_, and is frequently used
as a plural. It coalesces with the pronoun _ge_, _ghe_[54] (she), and with
the preterite of verbs terminating in _-de_ or _-te_,[55] and with some few
irregular verbs; as, _sagt_ (saw there), p. 37, l. 1301. The curious form
_negt_ (in l. 3964, p. 112) = _neg_ + _it_ = nigh it.

6. The A.Sax. _hi_ (they) is represented by _he_ = _hie_.[56] _He_ is
common enough in the Romance of Havelok the Dane.[57]

The pronouns, as has already been shown, coalesce with the plural (acc.)
_is_ (them), and give us the compounds _hes_, he + them; _wes_, we +
them;[58] mes = _me_ + _hes_ = one + them.[59]

Not satisfied with joining _he_ (they) to the pronoun _is_, the author of
this poem occasionally employs the more perplexing combination _hem_ = _he_
+ _hem_, he, them.

  bred kalue≈ø flei≈ø, and flures bred,
  _Roasted calves' flesh, and flour-bread,_
  And buttere, _hem_ √∞o sondes bed,
  _And butter, he them the messengers offered._‚Äî(l. 1014.)
  In ≈øichem feld ne fonde _hem_ nogt,
  _In Shechem field found he them not._‚Äî(l. 1933.)
  √êo ≈øette ≈øundri _hem_ to waken,
  _Then set sundry he them to watch._‚Äî(l. 2551.)
  √∞o ≈øeide √∞u≈ø quanne _hem_ cam dun,
  _Then said thus when he to them came down._‚Äî(l. 4022.)

In l. 2673 _hem_ seems to stand for _he_ + _hem_, they + them.

  And _hem_ ≈øeiden wi√∞ an≈øweren,[60]
  _And they to them said in answer._

The Southern _me_, one (Fr. _on_), is absent from this poem as well as from
the Ormulum; its place is supplied by _man_ and _men_[61] used with a verb
in the singular number. _√∞e_ is frequently used as a relative pronoun as
well as _√∞at_, but uninflected; _quo_ (who), _quat_ (what), are
interrogative; _whether_ signifies which of two.

  Dat.   Hem        It       |      ‚Äî‚Äî
  Acc.   Hem        It       |      Quam

The third personal pronoun is occasionally used reflexively; as _him_ =
himself. _Self_ is used adjectively in the sense of own, very, and the form
_selven_ (from the A.Sax. _sylfa_) is joined to the personal pronouns; as
_√∞eselven_, _himselven_, etc.

The independent possessives are _min_, _√∞in_, _his_ (_hise_), _hire_
(hers), _ure_ (ours), _gure_ (yours), _here_ (theirs).[62]


IV. VERBS.

_Infinitive Mood._‚ÄîThe infinitive terminates in _-en_, which is seldom
dropped.

There are no infinitives in _-y_ or _-ie_, as in Southern English writers,
nor do we find them in the Ormulum, or in Robert of Brunne's "Handlyng
Synne," and they were, most probably, wholly unknown to the East Midland
district.

The _t_ in the 2nd pers. sing. pres. is occasionally dropped, as _beas_ (=
_best_), art, _betes_, beatest, _findes_, findest, etc.; but not in the
preterite of regular verbs.

There are no instances of the 3rd pers. sing. present in _-es_ in this
poem.

The final _e_ of the first and third persons (sing.) of the preterite tense
is often dropped before a vowel or an _h_,[63] and, in a few cases, through
the carelessness of the scribe,[64] it is unwritten before a consonant,
where we should expect to, and do, find it in the majority of instances.

Some few strong verbs have become weak, as _grapte_ (grasped, felt),
_gette_ (poured), _smette_ (smote).

_Imperative Mood._‚ÄîVerbs forming the past tense in _de_ or _te_ take no
inflexion in the 2nd pers. sing. imperative.

_Participles._‚Äî1. The active or imperfect participle ends in _-ende_ or
_-ande_, the former being the Midland and the latter the Northumbrian form.
The Southern affix is _-inde_, from which we have the modern _-ing_ (O.E.
_-inge_).

Our author rhymes _specande_ with _lockende_, and in the Bestiary we find
that the participle in _-ande_ rhymes with an infinitive in _-en_,[65] and
this accounts for such forms as _stinken_ = _stinkende_, _brennen_ =
_brennende_, in the present poem.

2. The passive or perfect participle of regular or weak verbs terminates in
_-ed_; of irregular or strong verbs in _-en_. In _bigote_ (begotten),
_funde_ (found), _geue_ (given), the absence of the _n_ is probably an
error of the scribe.

3. The prefix _i-_ or _y-_ (A.S. _ge-_) is not of frequent occurrence
either in this poem or in the Bestiary; in the former we have _i-wreken_
(avenged), _i-wrogt_ (wrought), _ybiried_ (buried), _y-oten_ (called); and
in the latter we find _i-digt_ (arranged).

There are two conjugations of verbs, regular (weak) and irregular (strong).
The regular verbs form their past tense in _-ede_, _-de_, or _-te_; the
past participle ends in _-ed_, _-d_, or _-t_. Irregular verbs form their
past tense by a change of vowel, and the past participle terminates in
_-en_.

THE METRE OF THE POEM.


The essence of the system of versification which the poet has adopted is,
briefly, that every line shall have _four accented_ syllables in it; the
_unaccented_ syllables being left in some measure, as it were, to take care
of themselves.

The words which Coleridge prefixed to his poem of "Christabel" are by no
means inapplicable here. He says, "I have only to add, that the metre of
the 'Christabel' is not, properly speaking, irregular, though it may seem
to be so from its being founded on a new (?) principle: namely, that of
counting in each line the accents, not the syllables. Though the latter may
vary from seven to twelve, yet in each line the accents will be found to be
only four."

The normal form of the line of the present poem is that simple one of eight
syllables, consisting of four (so-called) iambics, which is so common in
English poetry. But it should be remembered that this line is at all times
convertible with one of _seven_ syllables, generally described as
consisting of three trochees and a long syllable. This is easily
exemplified by taking the first two lines of the Conclusion to the Second
Part of Coleridge's "Christabel."

  \/ ‚Äî‚Äî   \/   ‚Äî‚Äî    \/ ‚Äî‚Äî    \/  ‚Äî‚Äî
  A lit | tle child | a lim | ber elf ||
  ‚Äî‚Äî \/     ‚Äî‚Äî  \/    ‚Äî‚Äî \/    ‚Äî‚Äî
  Singing | dancing | to it | self ||

This is adopting the common form of scansion given in English prosodies,
which is far from being a very correct method; since to make _trochaic_ and
_iambic_ metres convertible is to introduce all sorts of confusion.

The fact is, that the _seven-syllable_ line, though _trochaic_ to the
_ear_, is really an _iambic_ line, of which the _first_ syllable is
_deficient_, i.e., supplied by a _pause_; and the truer scansion is,

  A lit | tle child | a lim | ber elf ||
  ‚Äî Sing | ing danc | ing to | itself ||

At any rate, to adopt this latter method (of beginning to mark off the feet
from the _end_, instead of from the _beginning_ of the line) will be found
to be far more convenient in practice; since the accented syllables,
instead of drifting about, will thus always be placed at the end of a foot.
We should thus, for instance, introduce the same marking off of syllables
in the line,

  √Ånd | √∞e s√©x | te d√° | is ligt ||      l. 167,

as we have in the line,

  √∞o c√°m | √∞e f√≠f | te d√° | is ligt ||      l. 158.

Examples of couplets containing a line of each kind are not uncommon; thus,
ll. 29, 30:‚Äî

  F√° | der g√≥d | of √°l | le √∞h√≠nge ||
  Alm√≠g | tin l√≥u | erd h√©g | est k√≠nge ||

Also lines 289, 290.

  And g√©t | ne k√∫ | √∞e h√© | nogt bl√≠nne ||
  F√≥r | to d√≥n | an √≥√∞ | er ≈ø√≠nne ||

See also ll. 309, 310; 439, 440, etc.

The introduction of these seven-syllable lines, far from being a defect, is
a natural and agreeable variation, adopted by all our best poets.

The next chief variation to be noted is that two very rapid syllables are
often (as in other English metres) substituted for an unaccented one, as in
l. 88:‚Äî

  √ìr | √∞e n√≠gt | and √°f | ter √∞e d√°y ||
                          ~~~~~~

Again, in l. 93:‚Äî

  On an √≥√∞ | er da√≠ | √∞is m√≠d | del √©rd ||
  ~~~~~

and in l. 474:‚Äî

  To sch√© | ten √°f | ter √∞e w√≠l | de d√©r ||
                     ~~~~~~

See also ll. 321, 503, 505, 656, etc.; and compare the line from
"Christabel:"

 "That sh√° | dowy in | the moon | light shone ||"
             ~~~~

The syllables thus most frequently _slurred over_‚Äîthe term _elided_ is but
weak and improper, explaining nothing‚Äîare the final syllables _-en_, _-er_,
_-et_, etc., as in ll. 96 and 116:‚Äî

  √Ål | ab√∫ | ten √∞is w√°lk | ne s√©nt ||
             ~~~~~~~

  Was w√° | ter and √©r√∞e | o ≈ø√∫n | der ≈ø√°d ||
           ~~~~~~~

Some lines‚Äîand these sound rather harshly‚Äîrequire a little _forcing_ to
make them conform to the strict type; as, _e.g._, l. 66, which, to make it
agree with the rest, must be written,

  √çn | to √∞is √∞h√≠≈ø | terne≈ø≈øe h√©r | bi-n√©√∞en ||
       ~~~~~~~       ~~~~~~~~

A poet's business is, in fact, to take care that the syllables which _are_
to be rapidly pronounced are such as easily _can_ be so; and that the
syllables which are to be heavily accented are naturally those that _ought_
to be. If he gives attention to this it does not much matter whether each
foot has _two_ or _three_ syllables in it.

A man is master of his art when he can write‚Äî

  Come in | to the gar | den, Maud ||
  For the black | bat, night, | has flown ||
  And the wood | bine spi | ces are waf | ted abroad ||
  And the musk | of the rose | is blown ||

With respect to the final _-en_, it should be further noted‚Äî

(1) That it is sometimes fully pronounced, as in ll. 87 and 91‚Äî

  fr√≥ | √∞at t√≠me | we t√©l | len √°y ||
  √∞o g√°n | hem d√° | gen w√©l | iw√≠≈ø≈øe ||

(2) That it is sometimes rapidly slurred over, as in l. 96, already cited;
and

(3) That (especially after an _r_) it is often so pronounced as to be
incorporated with the syllable preceding it, so that the whole word,
supposing it a dissyllable in appearance, becomes monosyllabic in
pronunciation; as in l. 514‚Äî

  Mat√∫ | ≈øal√© | was b√≥ren | i≈ø ≈ø√∫ne ||

and, again, in l. 655‚Äî

  W√≥ren | ≈øtalw√∫r | √∞i b√≥ren | bi t√°le ||

Thus, we may find the same word written and pronounced as a dissyllable‚Äî

  W√≥ | ren √∞√°ne | don ≈ø√≥ne | a-n√≥n ||   l. 3591;

and, in another place, written and pronounced as a monosyllable‚Äî

  In geu | el√©ng√∞h | e w√≥rn | it m√°d ||   l. 147.

Thus, the _n_ must have been _very slightly_ touched, as is shewn also by
the riming of _e_ and _en_. Examples, ll. 11, 12; 363, 364, etc.

As to the final _-e_, it may be observed that it is most frequently
pronounced just when it is most essential, viz., when it marks a
grammatical inflexion, or an adverbial form, as, _e.g._:‚Äî

  Til ih√© | sus b√©√∞ | on R√≥ | d√® d√≥n ||   l. 386;

and,

  W√©l | he ≈øe√≠ | den and ≈øw√≠ | √∞√® w√©l ||   l. 1645.

In the second place, it is very liable to be slurred over before a vowel
following, as in l. 148‚Äî

  In R√© | ke-f√≠l | le on ≈ø√∫n | der ≈øh√°d ||
                   ~~~~~

and, thirdly, it is frequently added to words without cause, and is
therefore mute, as in l. 60‚Äî

  √∞at √©u | ere ≈øpr√≥ng | in w√©rld | w√≠d ||

It seems to be sometimes mute after _-ed_, when _-ede_ forms part of a
verb. See ll. 1396, 1433, etc.

Attention to the metre may detect errors in the text. Thus, in l. 75, the
word _dais_ is missing:‚Äî

  for√∞ gl√≥d | √∞at f√≠r | me [d√° | is] l√≠gt ||

See l. 113, which proves the point.

In l. 1846 the definite form of the adjective is required, and _strong_
should be _stronge_‚Äî

  √∞e str√≥ng | e g√≥d | of √Ωs | ra√©l ||

It has been noted that the first foot of a line sometimes consists of _one_
syllable only, and that one _accented_. By a bolder license, this is
sometimes the case not only with the _first_ foot, but with _other_ feet,
e.g. with the _third_ foot. Line 2572:‚Äî

  Q_u_an √© | bru ch√≠ld | ≈ø√∫ld | be b√≥ren ||

Again, with the _last_ foot, as in l. 3580, unless we read _duste_:‚Äî

  And ≈øt√≠red | it √°l | to d√∫≈øt | ≈øir ||

Very many other curious variations occur, which the reader will probably
observe for himself with some interest. Thus, in l. 60, just above cited,
the question arises whether or not the _r_ in _werld_ was pronounced with
so strong a _burr_ as to render the word _dissyllabic_, as is often the
case in Scotch poetry with words containing _rl_, _rn_, etc.

  [1] My obligations to Mr Skeat (in whose accuracy and judgment I have the
      fullest confidence) are numerous; and I am indebted to him, among
      other obligations, for the description of the manuscript, and for
      some interesting remarks upon the metre of the poem. My thanks are
      also due to the Rev. J. R. Lumby, who most kindly and readily
      re-collated the text with the manuscript.

  [2] It is thus described‚Äîwrongly, of course, as to age‚Äîin the printed
      catalogue of the Corpus manuscripts:‚Äî"ccccxliv. A parchment book in
      8vo., written in the xv. century, containing the history of Genesis
      and Exodus in Old English verse."

  [3] From lines 19-26 we might infer that our author intended to include
      in his song much more of the Bible narrative than we have in the
      present work.

  [4] Father, God of all things, Almighty Lord, highest of kings, Give thou
      me a propitious season (enable thou me successfully), to show this

  [9] The Bestiary presents not only the same _grammatical_ and _verbal_
      forms which distinguish the Genesis and Exodus from other Early
      English compositions, but also its _orthographical_ peculiarities,
      _e.g._ _≈ø_ for _sch_; _√∞_ for _th_; _g_ for _y_ and _»ù_ (_gh_), etc.
      The editor assigns this poem to the _early_ part of the thirteenth
      century.

 [10] Warton assigned it to the reign of Henry II. or Richard I.; Sir F.
      Madden to the time of Henry III. (1216-1272).

 [12] Since writing the above I have printed for the Early English Text
      Society "Old English Homilies, 2nd Series," which are earlier than
      the Ormulum, and contain many East Midland peculiarities. "The Wooing
      of Our Lord" in Old English Homilies, 1st Series, contains some
      peculiarities of the West Midland dialect.

 [13] See Preface to O.E. Hom., 2nd Series.

 [14] It must be recollected that the Ormulum is much earlier than the
      Story of Genesis and Exodus.

 [15] See Ormulum, Introduction, p. lxxviii., note 105; lxxxi., note 112.

 [16] While agreeing with the editor of the Ormulum, that the simplicity of
      grammatical forms may fairly be considered as indicating a less
      artificial, and therefore advanced, stage of the language, I cannot
      adopt his theory, that "the strict rules of grammar" were therefore
      abandoned, and thereby was anticipated, to a certain extent, a later
      phraseology and structure; or that Orm, or any other O.E. writer,
      ever sacrificed "the more regular for a simpler, though more corrupt,
      structure and style." It must always be borne in mind that our
      earlier writers always speak of their language as English; but it was
      the English of the district in which they lived. In some districts,
      as in the Northumbrian, for instance, the language underwent certain
      changes at a very early period, which more Southern dialects did not
      adopt for more than a century afterwards: thus, in works of the 14th
      century, we find the Midland more archaic than the Northumbrian, and
      the Southern more archaic than either. Authors seeking to become
      popular would write in the dialect best understood by their readers,
      without considering whether it was simple or complex. Thus the
      Ayenbite of Inwyt (A.D. 1340), written for the men of Kent, contains
      far more of the older inflectional forms than the Ormulum of the
      twelfth century.

 [17] Southern writers before 1340 formed the g.s. of fem. nouns in _-e_
      and not in _-es_.

 [18] In the Southern dialect the article had separate forms for the
      nominative fem. (_theo_, _tho_), and neuter (_thet_, _that_); the
      fem. gen. sing. (_thar_, _ther_), and the masc. acc. (_than_,
      _then_).

 [19] See Ormulum, Introduction, p. lxxviii., note 105.

 [20] _Sinden_, are, occurs in the Ormulum and the Bestiary, but is not
      employed in the present poem.

 [21] These forms occur in O.E. Hom., 2nd Series.

 [22] In O.E. Hom., 2nd Series, we find _hes_ = them. See Moral Ode, l.
      186, O.E. Hom., 2nd Series: "wel diere he _hes_ bohte."

 [23] Robt. of Gloucester, Shoreham, Dan. Michel's Ayenbite of Inwyt.

 [24] Deep he _them_ buried under an oak.

 [25] For Solomon find _them_ shall.

 [26] He took _them_.

 [27] All his _footsteps_ after him he filleth, draweth dust with his tail
      where he steppeth, or dust or dew (moisture), that they are not able
      to find _them_.

 [28] I have in one case taken the liberty of separating the pronoun from
      the verb (for the convenience of the reader), giving the MS. reading
      in the margin; but I am sorry now that I did not let them stand as in
      the original copy.

 [29] _Mes_ = _me_ + _es_ = one, them, occurs in O. E. Hom., 2nd Series.

 [30] All _he them_ had (he had them all) with might begotten (obtained).

 [31] Undealt (undivided) _he them_ laid, whereso _he them_ brought.

        The dove hath habits good,
        All _we them_ ought to have in mind

      (_i.e._ we ought to have them all in mind).

        Bilhah two children bore by him,
        Rachel _called them_ Dan, Naphtali;
        And Zilpah two sons to him bore,
        Leah _called them_ Gad and Asher.

 [34] The tabernacle he _put them_ in.

 [35] He _set them_ in the firmament.

 [36] _√∞ei_ occurs _once_ only in the present poem, _√æe»ù»ùr_, _√æe»ù»ùm_, not
      at all; it occurs twice in O.E. Hom., 2nd Series.

 [37] Philolog. Soc. Proceedings, vol. i. pp. 73, 261. _Almigtin_,
      almighty, p. 2, l. 30, is the only _adjective_ I find with this
      termination.

 [38] The dative of the A.S. _b√≥c_ was _b√©c_.

 [39] _gebro√∞eren_ (A.S. _bro√∞ru_) occurs in the Semi-Sax. Gospels.

 [40] A.S. _cealfru_.

 [41] _cildru_.

 [42] _dura_.

 [43] _√¶gru_.

 [44] _handa_.

 [45] _c√Ω_.

 [46] _lambru_.

 [47] _grei√∞e_ (prepare), _kipte_ (seized), _lit_ (stain), _li√∞e_ (listen),
      _mal_ (speech), _witterlike_ (truly), are found in Southern English,
      and may be the remains of the Anglian element in the A.Saxon.

 [48] Those marked * thus constantly occur in Northumbrian and Midland
      works (with Northern peculiarities) of the 14th century.

 [49] _fere_ occurs for _feren_, so _senwe_ = sinews (A.S. _sinu_, sing.,
      _sina_, pl.).

 [50] As a rule fem. nouns, and nouns of the _n_ declension, take the
      inflexion _-es_; as, '_sinnes_ same' (sin's shame), '_sowles_ frame'
      (soul's profit), '_helles_ male' (hell's mail), '_werldes_ drof'
      (world's assembly). The Bestiary contains the following genitives in
      _-e_:‚Äî'_nese_ smel' (O.E. Miscell., p. 1), '_welle_ grund' (_Ib._, p.
      3), '_kirke_ dure' (_Ib._, p. 6), '_soule_ drink' (_Ib._, p. 7),
      '_soule_ spuse' (_Ib._, p. 23), '_helle_ pine' (_Ib._, p. 24).

 [51] The forms in _-er_, _-est_, are properly adverbial and not
      adjectival.

 [52] _tig√∞e_ = _tithe_, tenth, occurs in l. 895, and _tig√∞es_ in l. 1628.

 [53] Orm uses the more Northern _»ùho_ (Northumbrian _sco_).

 [54] _get_ = she it: "al _get_ bit otwinne," she biteth it all in two
      (Bestiary, O.E. Miscell., p. 9).

 [55] See p. xix.

 [56] _√∞ei_ occurs but once only.

 [57] O.E. Hom., 2nd Series.

 [58] See pp. xix, xx.

 [59] See Preface to O.E. Hom., 2nd Series.

 [60] If _godes_ = god's, _seiden_ (pl.) may be an error for _seide_
      (sing.), and _hem_ will then = _he_ + _hem_, he them.

 [61] Chaucer constantly uses _men_ with a _verb_ in the _singular_ number,
      third person. See Notes and Queries for Feb. 8th, 1873, where I have
      shown that the West-Midland substituted _men_ for the Southern _me_.

 [62] The genitive and possessive are denoted by one form; as, _ure_, of

 [63] Because elided in these cases.

 [64] The Bestiary is far more accurate in this respect.

 [65] _gangande_ rhymes with _standen_ (O.E. Miscell., p. 21, ll. 654,
      655).

 [66] This form is used when the pronoun follows.

 [67] _Followed_ by the pronoun.

 [68] The second person of irregular verbs (pret.) does not occur in the
      poem. In the Ormulum the inflection is _-e_, which is occasionally
      dropped.

 [69] These forms do not occur in the poem.

 [70] _Sinden_ = are, occurs in the Bestiary and the Ormulum. _Sinde_ and
      _senden_ in O.E. Hom., 2nd Series.

BALAAM'S ASS SPEAKS.


                                The angel went
                                further, and
                                stood in a narrow

                                and the ass fell
                                down under
                                Balaam,

  Balaam it ≈øpure√∞ and ≈ømit √∞or-on;
  And god vndede √∞i≈ø a≈ø≈øes mu√∞,

                                God opened the
                                mouth of the ass,
                                and she spoke to
                                her master.

                                infatuated man

                                He is cautioned

                                Joshua is appointed
                                to succeed

NOTES.


P. 1. ll. 1-2

  _Man og to luuen √∞at rimes ren,
  √∞e Wisse√∞ wel √∞e logede men._

_og_, another form of _agh_, = _ow_ = ought. _ren_ = _run_ = _rune_, song,
story.

 "Nalde ha nane _runes_
  Ne nane luue _runes_
  leornen ne lustnen."‚Äî(St. Kath. 108.)

_logede_ = lay. It is not necessarily unlearned, ignorant, etc., for O.E.
writers frequently use the term in contradistinction to clergy. See
Ayenbite, p. 197. "Vor all manere of volk studie√æ in avarice, and (both)
great and smale, kinges, prelates, clerkes, an _lewede_ and
religious."‚Äî(Ayenbite, p. 34.)

 "And bathe klerk and _laued_ man
    Englis understand kan,
  That was born in Ingeland."‚Äî(Met. Hom. p. 4.)

3 _loken_, to take care of oneself, to direct one's course of life, keep
from sin. See Ayenbite of Inwyt, pp. 1, 197, 199, 201.

 "Ac alneway hit is nyed to leawede men
  that hi ham _loki_ vram √æise zenne (avarice)."‚ÄîAyenbite, p. 31.

10 _√∞und_ is evidently an error for _gund_ = yond, yonder, over. Cp. gu for
√∞u, ll. 365, 366.

 "& _√æeond_ √æat lond he heom to-draf (B. & ouer al √æat lond he drof
      heom)."‚Äî(La»ù. i. 68.)

12 _earuermor_ = _eauermor_ = evermore. 14 _so√∞e-sagen_ = _so√∞e-sage_ =
_sooth-saw_ = sooth-saying, true saying.

15-16

  _Cristene men ogen ben so fagen,
  so fueles arn quan he it sen dagen._

  Christian men ought to be as fain (glad)
  As fowls (birds) are when they see it dawn.

17 _telled_ = _telle√∞_ = telleth. 20 _devil-dwale_ = devil-deceiver,
devil-heretic = arch-deceiver, arch-heretic. See l. 67. Cf. _ma»ù»ùstredwale_
= master heretic = arch-heretic, in the following passage:‚Äî

 "Off all √æis la√æe l√¶redd follc
    √ûat we nu m√¶lenn ummbe
  Wass _ma»ù»ùstredwale_, an defless √æeww,
    √ûat Arrius was nemmnedd."

  Of all this loathsome learned folk
  That we now talk about
  Was an arch-heretic, a devil's serf
  That Arius was named.
      ‚Äî(Orm. i. p. 258, l. 7454.)

23

  _til god srid him in manliched_,
  till god shrouded (clothed) himself in manhood.
  _srid_ = _sridde_.

24 _bote and red_, salvation and counsel. 25 _And unspered al √∞e fendes
sped_ = undid all the fiend's successful work (luck). 26 _halp_ = Old and
Middle Eng. _holp_ = helped, assisted.


P. 2. l. 27 _Biddi_, an error for _bidde_?

31-34

  _√∞u giue me seli timinge,
  To thaunen √∞is wer[l]des biginninge,
  √∞e, leuerd god, to wur√∞inge,
  Que√∞er so hic rede or singe!_

  Give Thou me a propitious opportunity
  To show (declare) this world's beginning,
  Thee, Lord God, for honour,
  Whether-so-ever I read or sing!

_thaunen_ = _taunen_, show, exhibit.

 "Ful wel he [Crist] _taunede_ his luue to man,
  Wan he √∞urg holi spel him wan."
      ‚ÄîBestiary (O.E. Miscell. p. 24, l. 767.)

The word is very uncommon in O.E. writers. Cp. O.Du. _t√¥nen_, to show. See
ll. 1022, 2034. _wur√∞inge_ = for worship, honour. _wur√∞inge_ is a noun, not
a participle or gerund. See l. 133. 38 _Ear √∞anne_ = ere that.

41

  _√∞o bad god wur√∞en stund and stede,_
  When God bad exist time and space.

43 _√∞rosing_ seems to be an error for _√∞rosim_ or _√∞rosem_ = fog, mist,
chaos. Cf. _waspene_ in l. 1440, p. 41, where the correct form is
_wasteme_. _a√∞rusemen_, to suffocate, occurs in Ancren Riwle, p. 40.

      w√≠te √æolia√∞
  h√°tne hea√∞o-welm
  helle to-middes
  brand & br√°de l√≠gas
  swilce e√°c √æa biteran r√©cas,
  _√ærosm_ and √æystro,

  torment they suffer
  burning heat intense
  amidst hell,
  fire, and broad flames;
  so also the bitter reeks
  smoke and darkness.
      (Caedmon, p. 21, 18.)

45 _√∞u wislike mune_ = do thou wisely bear in mind. 47 _hin_ = _hine_ =
him. 48 _or_, another form of _ar_, = ere, before. 49-56 The meaning of
these lines may be expressed as follows:‚Äî"And of them two [God the Father
and God the Son] that dearly love, who wield all here and above, _proceeds_
that holy love, that wise will [the Holy Ghost], that wieldeth all things
with right and skill [reason]. Might bad with word light exist; also that
might [the Holy Ghost] wieldeth _holy consolation_, for there are three
persons and one counsel, one might, and one godhead." 54 _Hali froure_ =
holy comfort, an allusion to the office of Holy Ghost as the comforter.

 "Hire uoster moder wes an √æe _frourede_ hire."

= Her foster mother was one who comforted her.‚Äî(St. Marherete, p. 8.) 58 _o
sunde[r] sad_ = _on sunder shad_, i. e. a-sunder shed = divided apart,
separated. It still exists in _water-shed_, Ger. _wasser-scheide_. Cf. l.
116. See Hampole's Pricke of Conscience, p. 271, l. 32. Cp. "the
_schedynge_ of tonges." (Trevisa's Translation of Higden's Polychron., p.
251.) "The longages & tonges were _ischad_ & to-schift."‚ÄîIb. p. 251.


P. 3. l. 63  _√∞is walkenes turn_ = this welkin's course. See l. 79.  64
_quuad_ = _biquuad_ = bequeathed, ordained. See l. 117.

69

  _And euerilc wunder, and euerilc wo._
  And every evil and every woe.

_Wunder_ = misfortune, evil. S.Saxon _wundre_, mischief, hurt.

 "hare lust leade√∞ ham to wurchen to _wundre_."
  = their lust leadeth them to work to mischief.‚Äî(St. Marh. p. 14.)

(See Sir Gawaine and the Green Knyght. Ed. Morris, l. 16.)

71-72 Our ancestors had some strange chronological theories.  In the Cursor
Mundi we read that Adam was made at _undern-tide_, at _mid-day_ Eve was
drawn from his side, and at _noon_ they both ate the apple, and were thus
only three _tides_ in bliss.[396]

73

  _√∞is ik_ (ilk?) _wort in ebrisse wen._

This same word is in Hebrew opinion (tradition). The true form is _wene_,
"_a wene_" = in supposition. See La»ù. l. 18752; Orm. l. 4326; Owl and
Nightingale, l. 237.

77 _a-gon_ = _agen_ = again. 78 _a-gon_ = gone.  It is our word _ago_.
Grammarians, therefore, altogether err in making the _a_ in _ago_ = the
prefixal element _ge_ (y) as in yclept. _agon_ and _ago_ = the A.Saxon
_ag√°n_ = _af-g√°n_, gone by, past. We have abundant examples in O.E. writers
of the verb _agon_ (ago) = to go. The past participle is _agon_ or _ago_,
in conformity to the rule that the past participles of verbs with this
prefix do _not_ take the initial _y_. 81 _o france moal_; in French speech;
_moal_ = _mel_ = speech. S.Saxon _m√¶lenn_, to speak. See Orm. vol. i. l.
99, 253. _mol_ also signifies tribute. See O.E. Hom. 2 S. p. 179; O.E.
Miscell. p. 151, l. 161. 87 _tellen_ = reckon. 88 _or_ = _ar_ = first.


P. 4. l. 102

  _It hiled_ [= hile√∞] _al √∞is werldes drof._
  = It surrounds (encloses) all this world's drove (assemblage).

_drof_ = A.S. _dr√°f_, company.

105

  _Til domes-dai ne sal it troken._
  Till doomsday it shall not fail.

_troken_ = S.Saxon _truken_, O.E. _trokie_.

 "Ah for nauer nare teonen
  Nulle we √æe _trukien_."

  But never for no injury
  Will we fail thee.

  ‚Äî(La»ù. i. p. 186.)

 "Ah nauest √æu neuere nenne mon.
  .    .    .    .    .    .
  √ûe cunne w√¶rc makien.
  √ûe nauere nulle _trukien_."

  But thou hast never no [any] man
  .    .    .    .    .    .
  Who can make a work,
  That never will fail.

The later copy reads "√æat neuere nolle _trokie_." See St. Kath. 1814.

107 _suuen_ = _shoven_, i. e. thrust, prest, driven.

111 _oo_ = O.E. _aa_ = _ai_  = ever.

119 _bir√∞heltre_, fruit tree, from _bir√∞el_, fruitbearing. Adjectives in
_-el_, _-ol_, are not uncommon in O.E. See O.E. Hom. 2 S. p. 131.

  Cp. "√∞are bwys bowys all for _byrtht_."
      Their boughs bend all for fruit.‚Äî(Wyntown, i. p. 14.)

124-5 _fodme_. When we find, as on p. 2, l. 43, _√∞rosing_ for _√∞rosim_, we
must not be surprised at learning that _fodme_ is an error for _fodinge_,
production; A.S. _fadung_, dispensation, order, production, from _fadian_,
_gefadian_, to dispose, order, produce. "Hw√¶t is se Sunu? He is √æ√¶s F√¶der
Wisdom, and his Word, and his Miht, √æurh √æone se F√¶der gesceop ealle √æing

125 _quueme√∞en_ = _quemeden_, pleased. See l. 86.


P. 5. l. 133

  _walknes wur√∞inge, and erdes [er√∞es?] frame._
  welkin's glory and earth's advantage.

_frame_ = advantage, gain, profit. See Handlyng Synne, ll. 5, 4249.

 "Twifold forbisne in √∞is der [the fox]
  To _frame_ we mugen finden her."‚Äî(O.E. Miscell. p. 14, l. 425.)

 "Summwhatt icc habbe sh√¶wedd »ùuw

    »ùiff √æat »ùe willenn foll»ùenn itt
    & »ùuw till _frame_ turrnenn."‚Äî(Orm. vol. i. p. 31.)

 "_Manne frame_ = men's advantage."‚Äî(O.E. Miscell. p. 2, l. 39.)

 "Jhesu, do me that for thi name
  Me liketh to dre»ùe pyne ant shame
  That is thy (the?) soule note ant _frame_,
  Ant make myn herte milde ant tame."‚Äî(Lyric Poetry, p. 71.)

134

  _He knowned (= knowe√∞) one ilc sterre name._
  He alone knoweth each star's name.

135 _He settes_ = He set (placed) _them_.  Cf. l. 156, where _wroutis_ =
wrought _them_. The pronoun _is_ or _es_ = them. See Prefaces to Ayenbite
of Inwyt, O.E. Hom. 1st and 2nd SS. 136 _√∞is walkne went_ = this welkin's
course. See l. 63. 141 _bi mannes tale_ = by man's reckoning. 143 _egest_ =
_hegest_ = highest. _√∞e sunnes brigt_ = the sun's brightness. 145 _mone√∞
met_, measure of a month. Cp. O.E. _metwand_. 148 _Reke-fille_ (see l.
3136) = _reke-fille√∞_ (cp. O.E. _winter-fylle√∞_ = October. See Menologium,
p. 62, ed. Fox), April (the vapoury or watery month).

155

  _wel wur√∞e his migt lefful ay._
  Well worth his might ever holy!

Cf. "_wo worth_ the day!" etc. _lefful_ = O.E. _gele√°fful_, faithful, holy.
O.E. Miscell. p. 23, l. 713. 160 _eruerilc_ = _eauerilc_ = every. 162 _his
flotes migt_ = his floating (swimming) power. Cp. "_a flote_," _a float_,
Rob. of Brunne, p. 169, l. 13. 163 _√∞en_ = to prosper, be successful. Cf.
the O.E. phrase, "so mot I _the_." 164 _tuderande_ = propagating, fruitful.

 "√ûa gyt drihten cw√¶√∞
  .    .    .    .    .
  w√≥rd to Noe
  tyma√∞ nu & _tiedra√∞_."

  Again the Lord spake
  .    .    .    .    .
  words to Noah:‚Äî
  Teem now and propagate.
      ‚Äî(C√¶d. p. 91.)

       "I was borenn her
  Off faderr & off moder.
  .    .    .    .    .
  √ûa √æe»ù»ùre time wass all gan

        I was born here
  Of father and mother.
  .    .    .    .    .
  When their time was all gone
  To propagate and to teem.
      ‚Äî(Orm. ii. p. 284.)

See O.E. Hom. 2nd S. p. 177, where _tuder_ = offspring.

168 _So_, an error for _√∞o_?


P. 6.  l. 169 _wrim_ = _wirm_ = reptiles.   170 _Qwel_ = _qwelc_; _quilc_ =
which.

172 _singen_, to sin. It is not an error for _sinnen_, but a genuine form
(contracted from _sinigen_), and not uncommon in O.E. writers. See
_sineged_ in l. 3555, p. 101.

 "He _su[n]ggeden_ and sorgeden and weren in √∞ogt."
  They sinned and sorrowed and were in thought.
      (O.E. Miscell. p. 22, l. 682.)

 "√ûe ver√æe manere to _zene»ùi_ in chapare is to zelle to tyme."
      ‚Äî(Ayenbite, p. 33.)

 "Alsuo may he mid his o»ùene wyue _zene»ùi_ dyadliche.‚Äî(Ibid. p. 36.)

_Sunegi_ = to sin, occurs in the "Owl and Nightingale," 926.

See _Sunegie_, _sunehi_, in O.E. Miscell. pp. 67, 68, 78, 79, 193.

173

  _to fremen and do frame_,
  to serve and do good.‚Äî(See l. 133.)

 "Heo scullen me mon-radene mid mo[n]scipe _fremmen_."
  They shall me homage with honour perform.‚Äî(La»ù. ii. 586.)

See St. Kath. 288; Anc. Riwle, p. 284.

_Freme_ and _frame_ are radically the same words, the former being of
A.Saxon and the latter of Norse origin. In the Ayenbite, p. 91, _vreme_ =
_freme_ = _frame_ is used exactly in the sense of _frame_: "We wylle√æ wel
√æet we be yvonded (tempted) vor hit is oure _vreme_ ine vele maneres, vor
we bye√æ √æe more ymylded and √æe dredvoller and √æe more wys ine alle √æinges
and √æe more wor√æ and √æe more asayd."  197 _oc_ = _og_  = _ow_, ought.


P. 7.  ll. 204-6

  Whilst it (the soul) followed holy will,
  God's self the while is pleased,
  And displeased when it loves sin.

_un-lif_ is evidently an error for _un-lief_ = displeased = O.E. _unle√¥f_.
In the MS. the _f_ has a long tail, and might almost stand for an
incomplete _k_.  217 _kiegt_ = _hight_ = threatened, literally promised.
222 _ilc here_ = each of them. Cf. the expressions _her non_, _non her_ =
none of them.  228 _sib_ = akin, related; still preserved in _gossip_,
originally _godsib_. See Ayenbite, p. 36.  230 _wrocte_ = _wrogte_ = pret.
of _worken_, to _ache_, _pain_, _hurt_. Cf. A.S. _rop-weorc_ =
stomach-ache; _weorcsum_, irksome. In the Reliq. Antiq., p. 51, a receipt
is given "for evel and _werke_ in √æe bledder." On p. 54 of the same work we
have a receipt for the "seke man" whose "heved _werkes_."  234 _√∞urte_, an
abbreviated form of _√∞urfte_ = behoved. This verb is used with the _dative_
of the pronoun. (See Handlynge Synne, l. 5826.)

 "Whyne had God made us swa
  √ûat us _thurt_ never haf feled wele ne wa."
      ‚Äî(Hampole's P. of C. 6229.)


P. 8. l. 240 _seli sped_ may be regarded as a compound, and printed
_seli-sped_ = good speed, prosperity. Cf. l. 310, where _iwel sped_ =
_iwel-sped_ = misfortune. Cf. O.E. _gode-happe_, prosperity, and
_ille-happe_, mishap. 247 _seuendai_ = _seuend dai_ = seventh day. 250
_newes_ = _a-new_, a genitival adjective used adverbially. Cf. our modern
adverb _needs_, O.E. _nedes_, of necessity; _lives_, alive. (R. of
Gloucester, 301, 376. Owl and Nightingale, 1632.) _deathes_ = dead. (R. of
Gl., 375, 382. Owl and Nightingale, 1630.) 255 _rode-wold_ = rode tree. I
have printed _rode-wold_ and not _rode wold_, because the two expressions
are widely different in meaning. In the latter phrase the word _wold_ = put
to death, slain; in the former it is a suffix = -tree, -beam; so that
_rode-wold_ corresponds exactly to the O.E. _rode-tre_ = _rood-tre_ = the
cross.

 "√ûe ille men in manhed sal hym [Christ] se,
  Anly als he henged on √æe _rode-tre_," etc.
      ‚Äî(Hampole's P. of C., l. 5260.)

Cf. _dore-tree_, Piers Pl. 833, and the phrases "hanged on a _tree_," "the
gallows _tree_," etc. O.E. _Tre_ = _tree_ = wood, beam (and _treen_ =
wooden), still existing in _axle-tree_, _saddle-tree_, etc. The _-wold_ in
_rode-wold_ must therefore = _-tre_ = wood, beam, which we still preserve
in _threshold_. O.E. _threshwald_, _threshwold_ (A.S. _thersc-wald_,
_thyrscwold_). The affix _-wold_ fortunately occurs again in lines 576 and
614 in the word _arche-wold_ = ark-board.

  Sexe hundred ger noe was hold,
  Quan he dede him in √∞e _arche-wold_.‚Äî(l. 576.)

  Sex hundred ger and on dan olde
  Noe ≈øag ut of √∞e _arche-wolde_.‚Äî(l. 614.)

A passage in C√¶dmon's poems furnishes us with the very term _ark-board_ by
which we have rendered _arche-wold_.

 "L√¶d swa ic √∞e hate
  under _earce-bord_
  eaforan √æine."

  Lead so I thee hete (command)
  under the ark-board
  thy progeny.
      ‚Äî(l. 23, p. 80.)

 "Him √æa Noe gewat
  swa hine nergand het
  under _earce-bord_."

  Noah then departed
  as him the preserver bad,
  under the ark board.
      ‚Äî(l. 4, p. 82.)

259

  _Si√∞en for-les √∞at dai is pris_
  Afterwards lost that day its honour.

266

          _And seli sad fro √∞e forwrogt._
  And _the_ righteous separated from the wicked (accursed).

_Seli_ constantly occurs in O.E. writers in the sense of _good_, and
_unseli_, with the opposite meaning of _bad_, _wicked_. At first sight it
would appear that the _for_ in _forwrogt_ is the same prefix which we have
in _forbid_, _forsake_, O.E. _for-worth_, "good for nothing;" but
_forwrogt_ in O.E. = overworked, and, hence, fatigued. _Forwrogt_ seems to
be connected with the O.H.Ger. _foruuerget_, cursed; O.E. _weried_, cursed.
The first interpretation, however, is supported by the Goth. verb
_fra-vaurkjan_; Ger. _verwirken_, s√ºndigen.

271

                  _Ligber he sridde a dere srud._
  Lucifer he shrouded (clothed) in dear (precious) shrouds (vestments).

_Ligber_ is evidently _Ligtber_ = Lucifer. It occurs in the Ayenbite, p.
10:‚Äî"And verst we wille√æ zigge of √æe zenne of prede, vor √æet wes √æe verste
zenne and √æe aginninge of alle kueade, for prede brek verst vela»ùrede and
ordre, huanne _Li»ùtbere_ the angel for his greate vayrhede and his greate
wyt wolde by above √æe o√ære angeles and him wolde emni to God √æet hine zo
vayr an zuo guod hedde ymad."

272-276

  And he became in himself proud,
  And with that pride upon him waxed envy
  That evilly influenced all his conduct;
  Then might he no lord tolerate,
  That should in any wise control him.


P. 9. l. 275 _√∞hauen_ = suffer, endure, tolerate. S.Saxon _√∞afen_,
_i√∞euen_; O.E. _thave_.

 "√ûe sexte bede √æatt mann bitt
  Uppo √æe Paterr Nossterr
  √ûatt iss, √æatt Godd ne √æole nohht
  Ne _√æafe_ la√æe gastess.
  To winnenn oferrhand off uss
  √ûurrh heore la√æe wiless."

  The sixth petition that one prayeth
  in the Pater Noster is that God should
  not suffer nor permit loathsome spirits
  to gain the upperhand of us
  through their loathsome wiles.
      ‚Äî(Orm. i. p. 188.)

 "& Hengest hine gon werien.
  & nalde it noht _i√æeuen_ [√æolie]."

  And Hengest gan him defend
  And would not suffer it.
      ‚Äî(La»ù. vol. ii. p. 215.)

276 _√∞hinge_ = place, office, duty; it seems to be here used adverbially in
the sense of "any wise," "at all." 276 _grauen_ is perhaps an error for
_√ærauen_, to compel, control. Cf. _gu_ for _√∞u_, p. 11, ll. 365, 366, and
_√∞und_ for _gund_. If _grauen_ be the original reading then it is
equivalent to _greven_. O.F. _grever_, Lat. _gravare_, to injure, grieve.

278

  _Min sete nor√∞ on heuene maken._

 "Sette," he (Lucifer) said, "mi sete I sal
  Gain him √æat heist es of alle;
  In √æe _north_ side it sal be sette,
  O me seruis sal he non gette."‚Äî(Cursor Mundi, fol. 4b.)

282 _geuelic_ = _geuenlic_ = like.  Cf. the A.S. _ge-efenl√¶can_, to be
like, to imitate. O.E. _euening_ = equal.

 "And √∞e√∞en he sal cumen eft,
  and thence he shall come again,
  .    .    .    .    .    .
  for to demen alle men,
  for to judge all men,
  oc nout _on-geuelike_.
  but not a-like."‚Äî(O.E. Miscell. p. 23.)

 "It (the law) fet √∞e licham and te gost oc nowt o _geuelike_."
  It feedeth the body and the spirit but not alike.
      ‚Äî(Ibid. p. 10.)

295 _√∞is quead_ = this wicked one. In Early English writers we meet with
several derivatives of this word, as _kueadliche_, wickedly, _kueadvol_,
sinful. (See Ayenbite of Inwyt, p. 4, and extract in Note to l. 271, p.
125.)

301

  _Euerilc √∞hing haued [haue√∞] he geue name_,
  To everything hath he given name.

309-310 Yet I ween I know of a device, that shall bring them misfortune.


P. 10. l. 314 _√∞or buten hunte_, there without search, or hunting, without
delay; _or_ thereabout to _hunt_ or search. 316 _bilirten_, to deprive of
by treachery, to cheat a person out of a thing.

 "√∞a herodes ges√¶gh for-√∞on bisuicen
  [& _bilyrtet_] w√¶s from dryum, [& tungul
  cr√¶ftgum] ura√∞ w√¶s sui√∞e."
      (Matthew ii. 16, Northumbrian version.)

 "Listne√∞ nu a wunder,
  √∞at tis der do√∞ for hunger:
  go√∞ o felde to a furg,
  and falle√∞ √∞ar-inne,
  in eried lond er in er√∞-chine,
  forto _bilirten_ fugeles."

  Listeneth now to a wonder,
  That this deer (fox) doth for hunger:
  Goeth a-field to a furrow,
  And falleth therein,
  In eared land or in earth-chink,
  For to deceive fowls.
      ‚Äî(O.E. Miscell. p. 13, l. 403.)

318 _dreue_ = trouble, disturb.   Cf. O.E. _drove_, to trouble, _droving_,
tribulation. "√ûa Herodes √æ√¶t gehyrde, √æa wear√∞ he _gedrefed_,[397] & eal
Hierosolim-waru mid him."‚ÄîMatt. ii. 3.

 "& for-√æi √æatt he sahh √æatt »ùho
  Was _dr√¶fedd_ of his sp√¶che
  He toc to froffrenn hire anann."‚Äî(Orm. i. p. 74.)

"And because that he saw that she was troubled at his word, he took to
comfort her anon." Southern writers, by metathesis, formed from _dreuen_
(_dreue_) the vb. _deruen_ (_derue_), thereby confounding it with another
vb. _deruen_ or _derue_, pret. _dorue_, p.p. _doruen_ (A.Sax. _deorfan_,
pret. _dearf_, p.p. _dorfen_), to labour, perish, be in trouble. _Dreue_ is
a transitive vb. of the weak conjugation, while _derue_ is intransitive and
of the strong conjugation, nevertheless we find _derue_ (pret. _dorue_),
taking the signification of _dreue_. "Stute nu earme steorue ant swic nu√∞e
lanhure swikele swarte deouel, √æ_a_t tu ne _derue_ me na mare."‚Äî(Seinte
Marherete, p. 12.) "Stop now, poor stern one, and cease now at once,
deceitful swart devil, that thou harm me no more." In La»ùamon we find not
only pret. _drof_ = distressed, but _derfde_, and the p.p. _iderued_. In
the Owl and Nightingale (ed. Wright), p. 40, we find the p.p. _idorve_ =
troubled, injured.

 "Other thou bodest cualm of oreve (orve),
  Other that lond-folc wurth _i-dorve_."

322

  _And senkede hire hure aldre bale_
  = And poured out to her the bale of us all,

_i. e._ gave her the cup of sorrow, of which we all drink; _senkede_ =
_schenkede_, to pour out, to give to drink, to _skink_. See Orm. ii. 181.
La»ù. ii. 202, 431; Alys. 7581; Owl and Nightingale, p. 70.

324

  _Quat oget nu √∞at for-bode o-wold_
  = What does now that prohibition signify?

_i. e._ What is the meaning of the prohibition; _oget_ = has, possesses _o
wold_ = _a wold_ = in force, in signification. Cp.

  _Quat-so his dremes owen a wold_
  = What-soever his dreams do mean.

In ll. 1671, 2122 _wold_ occurs as a noun = interpretation, meaning. The
connection between the idea of _power_, and _meaning_, _interpretation_, is
not, after all, so very remote.   Do we not speak of the _force_ of a word,
its _power_, _use_, etc., in an expression?   See Ormulum, p. 56, l. 11815.

327

  _for is fruit sired [sire√∞?] mannes mood_,
  = for its fruit enlighteneth (cleareth) man's mind.

330 _witent_ for _witen it_ = know it.   333 _on hire mod_ = in her mind.
339 _scro√∞t_ = _scro√∞_ = solicited; the pret. of _scri√∞e_. The original
meaning of the verb is, (1) to go; (2) to cause to go, to urge; (3) to
solicit.

341

  _for to for√∞en is fendes wil_,
  for to further (do) his foe's will.

 "For up he rigte√∞ him
  redi to deren,
  to deren er to ded maken
  if he it muge for√∞en."‚Äî(O.E. Miscell. pp. 5, 6.)

342

  _At he √∞at fruit, and dede unskil_,
  Ate he that fruit and committed sin.

_unskil_, literally, signifies indiscretion, folly, and by an easy
transition, sin, crime. (See Ormulum, vol. i. p. 12. Cf. O.E. _unskilwis_ =
irrational.)


P. 11. l. 345 _Vn-buxumhed_ = disobedience; but in line 346 it signifies
weakness, _un-lithesomeness_.

347-8

  _Vn-welde woren and in win
  Here owen limes hem wi√∞-in._

  Their own limbs within them
  Were powerless and in strife.

_vnwelde_ = unwieldy = the S. Saxon _vniw√¶lde_, heavy.‚Äî(Gower i. 312.)

 "‚Äî‚Äîhise limes arn _unwelde_."‚Äî(O.E. Miscell. p. 3.)

(_i. e._ weak with age); _in win_, in strife, conflict.

 "and wi√∞ al mankin
  he (the devil) haue√∞ ni√∞ and _win_" (envy and strife).
      (O.E. Miscell. p. 8.)

 "√∞is fis wune√∞ wi√∞ √∞e se grund,
  and liue√∞ √∞er eure heil and sund,
  til it cume√∞ √∞e time
  √∞at storm stire√∞ al √∞e se,
  √∞anne sumer and winter _winnen_ (strive)."
      (O.E. Miscell. pp. 16, 17.)

 "√ûar aros wale and _win_."
  There arose slaughter and strife.‚Äî(La»ù. i. 18.)

349

  _flesses freme√∞e and safte same
  bo√∞en he felten on here lichame._

  Lust of flesh, and shame of form
  both they felt in their bodies.

_freme√∞e_ seems connected with _fremen_ and _frame_. In the translation I
have connected _freme√∞e_ with O.E. _frim_, vigorous; but it may be another
form of O.E. _frum√∞e_, beginning. Then the translation of l. 349 would be
'the beginning of flesh and shame of form.'

360

  _√∞u haues √∞e sorges sig√∞he waked._
  Thou hast for thyself a sight of sorrow roused.

_sig√∞he_ = sight, but if it be an error for _si√∞he_ it will signify
adversity, mishap. 362 _ut luken_ = shut out. 363 _tilen √∞i mete[n]_ = earn
thy food. _tilen_ (till), earn, procure.

 "Ne maig he _tilen_ him non fode."
  He is not able to procure food for himself.
      (O.E. Miscell. p. 3.)

364 _wid_ = _wi√∞_, with. _swotes teres_ = tears of sweat, _i. e._ drops of
sweat. We may, however, by spoiling the metre, read _swotes & teres_, for
in O.E. writers _swot_ is frequently used in the singular and makes the
plural _swotes_.

365, 366

  _Til gu beas eft into er√∞e cumen_,
  Till thou art again into earth come.

_beas_ = _be'st_ = art. The present has also a future signification.

369 _ni√∞ful_ = envious.

 "O _nyth_ √æare springes mani bogh,
  √ûat ledes man to mikel wogh,
  for _nithful_ man he luuves lest,
  √ûe quilk he wat es dughtiest."
      ‚Äî(Cursor Mundi, MS. Cott. Vesp. A iii. fol. 153b.)

_lo√∞ an li√∞er_, loathsome and vile.

372

  _And atter on is tunge cliuen_,
  And poison on his tongue shall cleave.

373 _san_ = _schand_, disgrace, shame. Did the scribe originally write
_sam_ = shame? 377 _pilches_. This word answers to the "coats of skin" in
our English version of the Scriptures. In modern English _pilch_ is merely
the flannel swathe of an infant, but it formerly signified a fur garment.
Cf. Ital. _pellicia_, _pelizza_, any kind of fur; also Fr. _pelisse_
(pelice), a furred garment.

 "Here kirtle, here _pilche_ of ermine,
  Here keuerchefs of silk, here smok o line,
  Al-togidere, with both fest,
  Sche to-rent binethen here brest."‚Äî(Seven Sages, 473.)


P. 12. l. 384.

  _Cherubin hauet [haue√∞] √∞e gates sperd_,
  Cherubim have the gates bolted (barred, fastened).

391 _swem_ = sorrow, grief. See Gloss. to Allit. Poems, s.v. _swemande_.
Legends of Holy Rood, pp. 135, 201.

392

  _Of iwel and dead hem stonde√∞ greim_
  Of evil and death they stand in awe.

A similar phrase occurs in l. 432, p. 13. The phrase _stande awe_ is not
uncommon in O.E. writers.

 "Than sal be herd the blast of bem,
  The demster sal com to dem,
  That al thing of _standes awe_."
      (_i. e._ stands _in_ awe of.)
      ‚Äî(Met. Hom. p. xii.)

 "For Crist com sal be sa bright
  √ûat thoru √æat mikel lauerd might
  Him sal of _stand sa mikel au_,
  √ûat alle √æe filthes of his maugh
  Sal brist ute at his hindwin,
  For dred he sal haf of drightin."
      ‚Äî(Antichrist and the Signs of the Doom,
      in _Jahrbuch f√ºr Romanische und Englische Literatur_,
      1863, p. 203, l. 408.)

 "Thereof ne _stod him non owe_."‚Äî(Seven Sages, 1887.)

See Havelok the Dane, p. 9, l. 277.

393 _on sundri_ = _asunder_ = apart, separate.

398

  _And leded_ (lede√∞) _samen gunker lif_.
  And lead (pass) together your (two) lives.

_leded_ = _lede√∞_, is a verb in the imperative mood; _gunker_, the A.S.
_incer_ (_dual_) = your two, of you two. Cf. _»ùunkerr ba√ære_ = of you
both.‚Äî(Orm. i. 214.)

408

  _And sumdel queme√∞ it his seri mood_
  And somewhat it cheereth his sorry mood.

411

  _More for erneste dan [√∞an] for gamen_,
  More for necessity than for pleasure.


P. 13.  l. 417 _al swilc sel_ = all such time.

420

  _√∞an he was of is bro√∞er wold_,
  When he was by his brother killed.

421, 422

  _An hundred ger after is dead,
  Adam fro eue in srifte abead._
  A hundred years after his death,
  Adam from Eve in shrift (penance) abode.

(_i. e._ on account of the death of Abel.)

 "A hundred winter of his liue
  fra √æan forbar Adam his wiue,
  for soru of Abel √æat was slayn."‚Äî(Cursor Mundi, fol. 8.)

See Legends of the Holy Rood, pp. 20, 21.

431 _and wur√∞ ut-lage_ = and became an outlaw.

432

  _wi√∞ dead him stood hinke and age._
  Of death he stood _in_ dread and fear.

_hinke_ = _inke_, doubt, dread. See note on l. 392.

436

  _√∞eft and reflac √∞hugte him no same_,
  theft and robbery appeared to him no shame.

_Reflac_ = robbery with violence, rapine. (See La»ù. i. 172, 272, 424; ii.
526.)

 "√ûe first sin is o covatise
  √ûat revis mani man √æair praise,
  O √æis cumes blindnes and tresun,
  _Reuelaic_, theft, extorsiun."
        ‚Äî(The Seven Deadly Sins: _Cursor Mundi_, _Cott. MS. Vesp. A_ iii.)

438 _stonden agon_ = withstand, oppose. Cf. O.E. _again-stande_, to oppose.

439

  _Met of corn, and wigte of fe_,
  Measure of corn, and weight of goods.

The only objection against explaining _fe_ by goods or money is that in the
poem it signifies cattle, the proper term for goods, etc., being _agte_. In
La»ùamon _fe_, however, has the meaning of goods, money.

440

  _And merke of felde, first fond he_,
  And he first devised division (boundary) of fields (lands).

444 _at √∞e sexte kne_ = at the sixth degree.  _Kne_ in this sense is used
by Robert of Gloucester, p. 228:‚Äî"He come of Woden √æe olde louerd, as in
te√æe kne" (_i. e._ tenth generation). 450 _On engleis tale_ = in English
speech.


P. 14. l. 451 _kire_, modesty, purity. See La»ù. l. 8077. K. Horn, l. 1446.

456

  _He was hirde wittere and wal._
  He was herdsman wise and experienced (skilful).

See Gloss. to Allit. Poems, s.v. _wale_.

457-8

  _Of merke, and kinde, and helde, & ble,
  sundring and sameni[n]g tagte he._

He taught of (concerning) the character, breed, age, colour [of cattle],
the keeping them asunder, and the matching them together. _merke_ refers,
perhaps, to the _form_, _shape_, etc., of the cattle, and _kinde_ to their
_pedigree_. 459 _glew_, music, still exists in glee, _gleeman_, etc., O.E.
_gleowinge_ = singing. _gleu_, to amuse by singing.

 "Bi a piler was he √æar sett
  To _gleu_ √æaa gomes at √æair mete."‚Äî(Cursor Mundi, fol. 40b.)

Cf. _gleo_, music.‚Äî(La»ù. i. 298.) _gleo-cr√¶ften_ = glee-crafts, arts of
music.‚Äî(Ibid. i. 299.) _gleo-dreme_ = glee-sound.‚Äî(Ibid. i. 77.) _gleowen_,
_gleowien_, to chant, play.‚Äî(Ibid. ii. 382, 429.) 466 _a sellic smi√∞_, a
wonderful (rare) smith. 468 _To sundren and mengen_ = to separate (the ore
from the dross) and to mix (alloy).

469

  _Wopen of wigte and tol of gri√∞_
  = weapon of war and tool of peace.

_wigte_ = _wig_ = war. _Wigte_ may signify sharpness; it usually = strong,
brave.

470

  _wel cu√∞e egte and safgte wi√∞._

This line seems to be very corrupt and to stand in need of some emendation.
I would propose to read as follows:‚Äî

  _wel cu√∞e he fegte and sagte wi√∞_

= well could he _fight_ [_i. e._ with the _wopen_ of _wigte_] and _heal_
with [the _tol_ of _gri√∞_]. If this interpretation be right _tol of gri√∞_
would refer to some curative agents. 472 _wur√∞ bisne_, became blind.

 "√ûis Lamech was called Lamech √æe blind,
  Caym he slogh wit chaunce we find."‚Äî(Cursor Mundi, fol. 10.)

475

  _Al-so he mistagte, also he schet,_
  As he mistaught, so he shot.

477 _wende_ = _weened_, thought. 480-481 Cain unwarned, received it (the
arrow), groaned, and stretched (fell prostrate), and died with that
(immediately). _unwarde_ may be an error for _unwarnde_ = unwarned, or for
_unwared_ = A.S. _unwered_ = unprotected. 484 _dedes swog_ = death's swoon.
_Swog_ = O.E. _swowe_, _swoughe_.

 "_Aswogh_ (in swoon) he fell adoun
  An his hynder arsoun (rise of the saddle),
  As man that was mate."‚Äî(Lybeaus Disconus, 1171.)

The verb to _swoon_ occurs often in English under the form _swoghen_ (p.p.
_yswowe_),

 "The king _swoghened_ for that wounde."‚Äî(Kyng Alys., 5857.)

Cf. La»ù. 130, "_he fel iswowen_;" i. 192, _stille he was iswo»ùen_ (the
later copy reads _iswo»ùe_).

486

  _Of his soule be√∞ mikel hagt._
  On his soul is much sorrow.‚Äî(See l. 2044, p. 59.)

The literal signification seems to be thought, care. (See _Agte_ in l.
3384.)


P. 15. l. 490 _or or_, etc. = first ere, etc. = first before, etc. _fen_ =
mud, dirt.

 "Man here is nathyng elles
  Bot a foule slyme, wlatsom til men,
  And a sekful of stynkand _fen_."
        ‚Äî(Hampole's P. of C., l. 566.)

See R. of Gloucester, 6; Ps. (in Surtees' Psalter) xvii. 43. 492
_drinkilden_ = were drowned; _drinkil_ is a derivative of O.E. _drinke_, to
drown, a softer form of which is _drenche_, which often signifies in O.E. a
drink, potion (R. of Gl., p. 151; Ayenbite, p. 151, _dea√æes drenche_), as
well as to drink and to drown. See La»ù. i. 64.

 "& att te lattste _drunncnenn_ √æe»ù»ù
  √æa wrecchess, √æat hemm trowwenn.
  And at the last drown they
  The wretches who them trow (believe)."‚Äî(Orm. ii. 181.)

 "The see him gon _adrynke_
  That Rymenil may of-thinke."‚Äî(Kyng Horn, 978.)

494

                he began holy custom
  Of prayers, and of god-fearing-ness,
  for life's help and soul's comfort (counsel).

500 _alied_ = _halihed_ = holiness; _toch_ = _toc_ = took. 501 _fro mannes
mene_, from man's fellowship, society. The usual form of _mene_ in O.E. is
_ymene_, _ymone_ = common, general. 503-510 From Hampole's Pricke of
Conscience, pp. 122-126, we learn that both Enoch and Hely (Elijah) shall
come before doomsday to turn the Jews from following Antichrist to the
Christian law:‚Äî"For 1260 days, or three years, shall they continue to
preach. Antichrist, in great wrath, shall put the two prophets to death in
Jerusalem, where their bodies shall lie in the streets for three days and a
half, after which they shall ascend to heaven in a cloud. After their death
Antichrist shall only reign fifteen days, at the end of which time he shall
be slain before the Mount of Olivet." Some "clerks" affirm that he shall be
slain by St Michael in Babylon, "that great hill." (See "_Antichrist and
the Signs before the Doom_," in Jahrbuch f√ºr Romanische und Englische
Literatur, 1863.) 517 _Metodius_. In the "Polychronicon Ranulphi Higdeni,"
p. 23, ed. by Churchill Babington, 1865, amongst the "auctores names" we
find mention made of "Methodius etiam martyr et episcopus, cui incarcerato
revelavit angelus de mundi statu principio et fine." 518 _sighe sir_ =
_sig√∞he sir_ = _sheer insight_, clear fore-knowledge.


P. 16. l. 525 _quat agte awold_ = what should happen. 526 _water wold_,
destroyed by water. _wold_ may = _walled_, flooded, from _wallen_. 530
_hore-plage_, whore-play, whoredom. Cf. O.Sax. _hor-uuilo_; O.H.G.
_huorgilust_. In O.E. _hore_ (not _w_hore) was an epithet applicable to men
as well as women. It occasionally signifies adultery. It is found in
combination as a qualifying term in _hore-cop_, _horesone_, a bastard;
_hore-hous_, a brothel. The O.E. _horwed_, defiled, unclean; _horowe_, foul
(Chaucer); _hori_, _ouri_, dirty; Provincial E. _horry_ (Devonshire), seem
to belong to another family of words.

532

  _Wimmen welten weres mester_
  Women wielded a man's art.‚Äî(See Rom. i. 26.)

See Allit. Poems, p. 46, ll. 269-272.

533

  _And swilc woded wenten on_,
  And such madness (folly) went on.

_woded_ = _wodhed_. Cf. _alied_ = _alihed_ = holiness (l. 500, p. 15). "√ûe
o√æer ontreu√æe √æet com√æ of prede is _wodhede_, me halt ane man _wod_ √æet is
out of his wytte, in huam skele is miswent."‚Äî(Ayenbite, p. 12.)

534

  _Golhed hunkinde he gunnen don_,
  Unnatural lust they did commit.

_Golnes_ = lust, lasciviousness, occurs in the Owl and Nightingale, l. 492.
Ancren Riwle, p. 198.  Ps. lxvii. 14.

 "Non lest (listen) on man do amys
  Thor»ù hys o»ùene _gale_ (lust)."‚Äî(Shoreham, p. 107.)

_hunkinde_ = _unkinde_, unlawful, unnatural. 536 _quad mester_, wicked
craft (practices). See Allit. Poems, p. 46, ll. 265-268. _Quad_ takes
several forms and meanings in O.E.; as _qued_, wicked (Kyng Alys., 5619;
evil, 4237); the devil (R. of Gl., 314); _quead_, wickedness (Ayenbite, p.
4); _quathe_, _wothe_, _wathe_, evil, harm (Hampole's P. of C., 2102, 4558;
Allit. Poems, B. 885).

 "De _qu√¢t_ deit, de schuwet g√™rn dat licht."‚Äî(Reynard the Fox.)

537 _hun-wreste plage_, wicked lust; _hun-wreste_ = _unwreste_, weak,
frail, and hence wicked.

 "M√¶rling _vnw√¶rste_ [_onwreste_] man
  Whu h√¶uest √æu me √æus idon."‚Äî(La»ù. ii. 228.)

 "√ûenne √æat h√¶fd (leader) is _unwr√¶st_ [_onwrest_]
  √ûe h√¶p (host) is √æ√¶ wurse."‚Äî(_Ibid._ vol. ii. 259.)

 "Thanne a»ùte men here wyves love,
  Ase God doth holy cherche;
  And wyves nau»ùt a»ùens men
  Non _onwrestnesse_ werche,
                  Ac tholye,
  And nau»ùt _onwrest_ opsechen hy

See Orm. i. 168-9. A.Sax. Chron., 1052. Wright's Lyric Poems, 37. Kyng
Alys., 878. Owl and Night., 178. 538 _A √∞efis kinde_ = in thief's kind, in
sodomy. _thief_ in O.E. was a general term of reproach.  Perhaps in _√∞efis_
we have an allusion to _Cain_.

542

  _And leten godes frigti-hed_
  And forsook the fear of God.

544

  _And mengten wi√∞ waried kin_
  And intermixed with accursed kin.

545

  _Of hem woren √∞e getenes boren_
  Of them were the giants born.
        ‚Äî(See Genesis vi. 4.)

546

  _Migti men, and figti, for-loren_
  = _Migti men, figti and forloren_,
  Mighty men, warlike and forlorn (doomed).

548 _litel tale_, little account (worth). 553 _blissen_ = _lessen_ =
_be-lessen_ (?) or _bi_ + _leschen_, to soften.   Cf. _blinnen_ and
_linnen_ = to cease.   See ll. 3653, 3803.

554

  _√∞at it ne wexe at more hun-frame_
  lest it should grow to greater evil.

_hun-frame_ = _unframe_, loss, disadvantage.   556 _deres kin_ = animals.


P. 17. l. 560 _gri√∞_, protection, safety.

 "he wuneden (dwelt) seo√∞√∞en (afterwards) here
  inne _gri√∞e_ and inne fri√∞e (peace)."‚Äî(La»ù. ii. 50.)

 "Lauerd, lauerd, »ùef (give) me _gri√∞_."‚Äî(Ibid. iii. 35.)

Cf. _greth_, quarter (Sir Cleges, 292). _grith-bruch_, breach of the peace
(Owl and Nightingale, 1043). _grith-sergeant_ (Havelok, 267). 561
_feteles_, a vessel, a _fat_ or _vat_.

 "√æe firrste _fetless_ wass
  Brerdfull off waterr filledd."‚Äî(Orm. ii. 148.)

 "Sex _feteles_ of stan war thar stan[d]and,
  Als than was cumand in the land
  And Crist bad thaim thir _feteles_ fille

        ‚Äî(Met. Hom. p. 120.)

562 _set_, made, formed. _limed_, daubed, pitched. 564 _sperd_, _sparred_,
barred. See Orm. D. 261; H. i. 142, ii. 68; Havelok, 448. _spere_ or
_sparre_ signifies also to lock, shut up. _Chaucer_, Troilus and Creseide,
v. 455; _Bone Florence_, 1774. _√∞ig_ = _√∞ic_, thick.

566

  _√∞or buten noe(.) long swing he dreg._
  Thereabout Noah endured long toil.

_swing_ = _swinc_, toil, labour. 568 _welken_, pass away, literally to
fade, wither; and usually applied to plants and flowers.

 "It wites als gresse areli at dai,
  Areli blomes and fares awai;
  At euen doun es it brogt,
  Un-lastes, and _welkes_, and gas to noght."‚Äî(Ps. lxxxix. 6.)

See Hampole's P. of C. l. 707. 576 _arche-wold_. See note to l. 255. 582
_gette_ or _get_, poured down. _gette_ is the preterite of _geten_ or
_gete_. See l. 585. Cf. O.E. _yhete_ (_»ùete_); pret. _yhet_; p.p. _yhoten_
(_i»ùote_).

 "_Yhet_ over √æam √æi wreth."‚Äî(Ps. lxviii. 25.)

See Ps. xli. 5, lxxiii. 21. Percy's Reliq. vol. ii. 81. Cf. "a metal
_geoter_," a metal caster, Kyng Alys. 6725. _out-yhetted_, poured out,
Hampole's P. of C. 7119. See Gloss. to Allit. Poems, s.v. _Gote_. 592
_moned_ = _mone√∞_ = month.


P. 18. l. 598 _dragen_ by metrical license for _wi√∞-dragen_, withdrawn. _√∞e
watres win_ = the water's force (strife). _Winne_ in O.E. has the
signification of to fight, contend with, strive, and hence to get. Cf. O.E.
_wunne_, victory; _wan_, contrivance, remedy.   See l. 347.

 "Alle we atter dragen off ure eldere,
  √∞e broken drigtinnes word √∞urg √∞e neddre;
  √∞er-√∞urg haue√∞ mankin
  bo√∞en ni√∞ and _win_."‚Äî(O.E. Miscell. p. 11.)

607 _est_ = east. Probably only an error for _eft_ = again.   614
_arche-wolde_. See note to l. 255. 617 _Rad_ = hasty, rash. Literally it
signifies ready, and frequently occurs in O.E. writers with this meaning.
Cf. O.E. _ger√¢d_, _r√¶dl√Æce_, _r√¶dliche_, _radely_, _radly_, promptly,
quickly, suddenly. See l. 2481, and Owl and Nightingale, ll. 423, 1041,
1279; La»ù. 25603; St Marh. p. 10; Avow. Arth. xix. 6.


P. 19. l. 630 _tudered_ (see note to l. 164).

631-637

  Often he prayed with timid prayer,
  That such vengeance as God then did
  Should no more on the world come,
  What vengeance so _ever_ there should be taken.
  God granted it in token of love,
  Showed him in the welkin above
  A rainbow, they call it, red and blue.

_so_ after _swiulc_ is a true relative, as in the oldest period.

635 _gat_ = granted. It is the preterite of a verb _gate_, to grant.

 "Fourti dais he sal [tham] _yate_
  √ûat fallen ar ute o √æair state
  √ûoru foluing o √æat fals prophet,
  √ûat √æai mai √æam wit penance bete."
        ‚Äî(_Antichrist_, in Jahrbuch f√ºr Romanische und Englische Literatur,
        1863, p. 204, l. 428.)

_gate_ or _yate_, pret. _yatte_, is the Northern form of the word, the
corresponding southern term is _»ùete_, pret. _»ùette_.

 "& »ùho ne wass nohht t√¶r onn»ù√¶n,
  Acc _»ùatte_ hemm hƒïre wille
  & _»ùatte_ √æatt »ùho wollde ben
  Rihht la»ùhelike fesstnedd

  Wass la»ùhe to ben fesstnedd."‚Äî(Orm. i. 80.)

 "& √æe king him _»ùette_
  swa Hengist hit wolde."‚Äî(La»ù. ii. 172.)

 "& √æe king him _»ùette_
  al √æat he »ùirnde."‚Äî(La»ù. i. 189.)

See Seinte Marherete, p. 18. Allit. Poems, p. 17, l. 557.  _a_ = _an_ = in.
637 _men cleped_ = one calleth it; _cleped_ = _clepet_ = _clepe_ + _et_;
_et_ = it. We have a similar construction in l. 1082:

 "for al √∞at nigt he sogten √∞or
  √∞e dure, and _fundend_ neuere mor."

_fundend_ = _funden_ + _ed_ = _founden_ + _et_ = found it. The author of
the poem constantly joins the pronoun _et_ = _it_ to the preterite of weak
verbs. See line 479, where _letet_ = let it. 590 _stodet_ = _stod it_ = it
stood. 1654 _kiddit_ = _kidd it_ = showed it. As the plurals of the present
indicative do not end in _-e√æ_ or _-et_ in the poem, but in _-en_ (_-n_),
_cleped_ may be an error for _clepe√∞_ or _clepeth_ = calls, and _men_ =
O.E. _me_ = one. See line 750.

643-644

  And as high the flame shall go,
  As the flood flowed on the downs (hill).

_lowe_, a northern term (of Norse origin) for flame, the southern form (of
A.Sax. origin) is _leie_.  Religious Songs in Old Eng. Miscell., pp. 67,
182.

 "Of his neose-√æurles
  cume√∞ √æe rede _leie_."

See also Legend of St Brandan, 512.

 "√ûair throtes sal ay be filled omang
  Of alle thyng √æat es bitter and strang,
  Of _lowe_ and reke with stormes melled,
  Of pyk and brunstane togyder welled."
        ‚Äî(Hampole's P. of. C., l. 9431.)

653 _vten_ = _wi√∞-vten_, without, besides. See l. 656. Cf. l. 596, with l.
598. 655 _bi tale_, in number.


P. 20. l. 676 _gan ille wune_, began wicked practices. 678 _muni[gin]g_ =
remembrance. 692 _fendes flei√∞ing_, fiends' strife. Probably _flei√∞ing_ =
_flitting_, contention, strife. The phrase _fendes fleathe_ = ? _fendes
flei√∞ing_, occurs in Shoreham's poems, p. 97.

 "»ùyf thou rewardest thyne eldrynges nau»ùt
  A-lyve and eke a-dethe,
  That were wel besy to brynge the forthe,
  .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .
  »ùyf thou hy gna»ùst and flag»ùst eke,
  Ry»ùt hys that _fendes fleathe_."


P. 21. l. 713 _hicte_ = _higte_, was called, named. 724 _wol wel_ = _wel
wel_ = very well, extremely well. Cf. the O.E. expressions _wel ald_, _wel
lang_, etc., very old, very long, etc.; _wol wel_ corresponds exactly to
the O.H.G. and M.H.G. _vil wol_; Mod. Ger. _sehr wohl_. See Erec. (ed.
Haupt. 1839), 2017.

725

  _Thare let hur, and √∞e√∞en he nam_,
  Terah left Ur, and thence he went.

_let_ (pret. of _lete_) = left; _nam_, literally took, and hence took the
way, departed, went. See ll. 744, 745. 727 _burgt_, an error for _burg_.


P. 22. l. 743 _for_, went. See l. 763.

748

  _Of weledes fulsum and of blis_    Rich of (in) wealth and of (in) bliss.

_weledes_ is an error for _wel√∞es_; it may = _werldes_ = world's; _fulsum_
= rich, plenteous, bountiful, occurs in O.E. _fulsumhed_ (see l. 1548),
_fulsumly_.

749 _ist_ = _is it_, is there.

751

  Each thing dieth that therein is cast.

753 _√∞us it is went_ = thus is it turned _or_ changed. 754 _brimfir_, if
not an error for _brin-fire_ (burning fire; see l. 1164), signifies
wild-fire, _i.e._ brimstone. Cf. A.Sax. _cwic-fyr_ = fire of brimstone. 763
_hunger bond_. We ought, perhaps, to read _hunger-bond_, corresponding to
the German _hungersnoth_, famine, dearth. Cf. luue-bond, l. 2692, force of
love. 764 _feger_ = _feyer_, far. 767 _to leten_ = to lose.


P. 23. l. 787 _erdne_ = _ernde_, errand, prayer, petition, message.

 "Ih scal iu sagen imbot,
  gibot ther himilisgo Got,
  Ouh nist ther er gihorti
  so fronsig _arunti_."‚Äî(Otfried's Evangelienbuch.)

_to god erdne beren_ = to intercede with God. _Ernde_ occurs in Lyric
Poetry, p. 62, in the sense of to intercede. 792 _arsmetike_ =
_arsmet[r]ike_ = arithmetic.

793

  _He was hem lef, he woren him hold_,
  He was dear to them, they were true to him.

795 _sat_ = _schat_, treasure, still existing in _scot_, _shot_. 796
_vn-achteled_, unestimated, immense; from _achtel_, to estimate, reckon.
See Stratmann, s.v. _ahtlien_.

801

  _√∞or he quilum her wisten wunen_,
  Where they formerly wished to dwell.


P. 24. l. 813 _atte√∞_ = _hatte√∞_, is called.

827

  _√∞er het god abre √∞at tagte lond_, etc.
  There God promised Abraham that promised land, etc.

_tagte_ = _bitagte_, literally, assigned, appointed. 832 _giscinge of
louerd-hed_ = desire of lordship, greed of dominion. _Giscinge_ =
covetousness; the correct form is _gitsing_ (_»ùitsung_, _»ùittsung_), but
_»ùissinge_ is found in La»ù. ii. 227. Cp. _yssing_, O.E. Miscell. p. 38.
_icinge_, Ayenbite, p. 16, and see Orm. i. 157.

 "Al his motinge (talk)
  was ful of _»ùitsinge_."‚Äî(La»ù. i. 280.)

833

  _Neg ilc burge hadde ise louereding_,
  Nigh each borough (city) had its lord.

834 _kumeling_ is literally a stranger, foreigner, but here signifies a
king or ruler not of native blood, one of foreign extraction. See
_Comeling_ in Prompt. Parv. p. 89.

 "For I am a _commelyng_ toward √æe
  And pilgrym, als alle my faders was."

P. 25. l. 842 _ferding stor_, a great army.  See O.E. Hom. 2nd S. p. 189.

844 _gouel_, tribute, tax. Later writers use the word _gauel_ or _gouel_ in
the sense of usury. See Ayenbite, p. 35; O.E. Miscell. p. 46. Cf.
_gaueler_, usurer. Ayenbite, p. 35; Ps. cviii. 11. 847 _haued_ = _haue√∞_,
hath. 848 _here-gonge_, invasion.

 "For ich am witi ful iwis,
  And wot (knoweth) al that to cumen is:
  Ich wot of hunger [and] of _hergonge_."
        ‚Äî(Owl and Nightingale, l. 1189.)

851 _fowre on-seken and fifue weren_ = four attack and five defend.
_on-seken_ = attack.

 "heo wenden to beon sikere.        They weened to be secure
  √æeo Belin heom _on-sohte_."        when Belin attacked them.
        ‚Äî(La»ù. i. 241.)

864 _witter of figt_ = skilled in fighting. See Gloss. to Allit. Poems,
s.v. _wyter_, and La»ù. i. 260, 409; ii. 247.

866

  _Abram let him tunde wel_,
  Abram caused himself to be well surrounded (well guarded).

869 _wenden_, thought.

875

  _wi√∞-√∞uten [= wi√∞√∞-uten] √∞o √∞e cuden flen_
  = except those who could flee.


P. 26. l. 882 _bat_ = _bad_ = _bead_ = literally offered, and hence
restored. _bat_ = _bette_ occurs in Legends of Holy Rood for _amended_,
restored, p. 210, l. 6. 886 _Borwen_, delivered, rescued, the p.p. of
_bergen_ (O.E. _ber»ùe_, _berwen_).

 "√ûis boc is ymad vor lewede men
  vor vader and vor moder and vor o√æer ken
  Ham vor to _ber»ùe_ vram alle manyere zen
  √æet in hare inwytte ne bleve no voul wen."
      ‚Äî(Ayenbite, p. 211.)

"And huo √æat agelt ine enie of √æe ilke hestes him ssel √æer-of vor-√æench,
and him ssrive, and bidde God merci yef he wyle by _ybor»ùe_."‚Äî(Ibid. p. 1.)
Orm uses _berr»ùhenn_, to save, preserve, from which he forms the derivative
_berrhless_, salvation. 888 _feres wale_, brave companions (allies). _Wale_
signifies select, choice, worthy, and hence brave. See Gloss. to Allit.
Poems, s.v. _Wale_.

893

  _He fro√∞er[ed]e him after is swinc._
  He comforted him after his toil.

Herbert Coleridge (Gloss. Index, p. 33) connects _fro√∞ere_ with the A.Sax.
_frofrian_, to comfort. Of course there is nothing to be said against the
interchange of _f_ and _th_ (cf. _afurst_, thirsty; _afyngred_, hungry,
etc.); but the A.S. _freo√∞ian_, to protect, render secure, is nearer in
form, and there is the O.E. _vre√æie_ (Ayenbite) to prove that this verb had
not gone out of use. 895 _√∞e tig√∞e del_ = the tenth part. _tig√∞e_ = _tithe_
= tenth. 898 _bargt_ = _barg_ (the pret. of _bergen_) preserved. 910
_wi√∞-uten man_ = except the men. The rhyme seems to require us to read
_nam_; the meaning would then be "without exception _or_ reserve."

911

  _Alle hes hadde wi√∞ migte bi-geten._
  He had them all with might begotten (obtained).

_hes_ = _he_ + _es_ = he + them. The combination _hes_ occurs again in l.
943. _es_ or _is_ = them, as in l. 949. See Note to l. 135, and Preface to
O.E. Miscell. p. xv, and O.E. Hom. 2nd S. p. xii.


P. 27. l. 913 _me√∞elike wel_, with great moderation, very meetly. Cf.
_unmea√∞eliche_ in Seinte Marherete, p. 10. _me√∞eliche_ in O.E. Hom. 2nd S.
p. 7. _me√∞leas_, Ancren Riwle, p. 96. 918 _algen_ = _halgen_ = hallow. 920
_bi-told_ (rescued) should be the pret. of a vb. _bitellen_, but no such
word occurs in the poem. See O.E. Hom. 1st S. p. 205. Owl and Night. l.
263. La»ùamon uses _bi-tellen_, to win.

 "Ac wih him we scullen ure freoscipe (freedom)
  mid fehte _bitellen_."‚Äî(Vol. i. p. 328.)

 "Bi-√∞enche√∞ eow ohte (bold) cnihtes
  to _bi-tellen_ eoweore rihtes."‚Äî(i. 337.)

The editor explains _bitellen_ by to _win_, but _regain_ would suit the
context.

 "Nu √æu hauest Brutlond,
  Al _bi-tald_ to √æire hond."‚Äî(Vol. ii. p. 335.)

 "Nu ich mi lond habben _bi-tald_."‚Äî(Vol. iii. p. 258.)

924

  _Quo-so his alt him bi-agt_
  = Whoso them (goods) holdeth, him it behoveth (yield as tithes).

_His_ = _is_ = _es_, them. 927 _gulden wel_, requited well.

934

  _Of √∞e-self sal √∞in erward ten_,
  Of thyself shall thine heir come.

_erward_ = _eruweard_, heir. 939 _nam god kep_ = took good heed to,
attended carefully to. _kep_ = care. See R. of Gl. 177, 191. Owl and Night.
l. 1226. Hampole's P. of C. ll. 381, 597. 941 _Euerilc_, each, every one.
_euerilc_ is the same as the O.E. _euerich_, Mod. Eng. _every_.

943

  _Vndelt hes leide quor-so hes tok_,
  Undivided he laid them where-so he took (brought) them.

This line refers to the "_duue and a turtul_," in the following line. See
Genesis xv. 10. 945 _on-rum_ the same as _a-rum_, apart, aside.

 "Tho Alisaundre sygh this,
  _Aroum_ anon he drow, ywis,
  And suththe he renneth to his muthe (army)."
        ‚Äî(Kyng Alys., 1637.)

946

  _And of √∞o doles kep he nam._
  And of the pieces care he took.


P. 28. l. 949 _kagte is wei_, drove them away. _kagte_ is the pret. of
_kache_, to drive.

 "And he ansuered als he war medde,
  And said, Allas and wailewaye.
  That ever I com at yon abbaye,
  For in na chaffar may I winne
  Of tha lurdanes that won tharinne
  For likes nan of thaim my play,
  Bot alle thar _kache_ me away."‚Äî(Met. Hom. p. 151.)

953-954 God said to him in true dream, the _future_ condition of his seed.
_beren-tem_ = _barn-teem_, offspring, descendants.

 "We are alle a (one) man _barn-teme_."‚Äî(Cursor Mundi, fol. 27b.)

956

  _And uten erdes sorge sen._
  And in foreign lands sorrow see (experience).

Cp.

 "_Outen_ sones to me lighed √æai,
  _Outen_ sones elded er √æai."‚Äî(Ps. xvii. 46.)

 "Filii alieni mentiti sunt mihi, filii alieni inveteraverunt."

Cf. _uten stede_, l. 1741. O.E. _utenlande_, a foreigner. Havelok, l. 2153.
958 _Hor_ = _or_, before. 960 _√∞at hotene lond_, that promised land. 964
_untuderi_, barren. The usual O.E. term is _unberand_, unbearing. See O.E.
Hom. 2nd S. p. 177. 965 _abre_ = to Abram. 969-971 And Sarai would not
suffer it, that Hagar were thus swollen (with pride). She held her hard in
thrall's wise (treated her as a slave). 974 _one and sori_, solitary and
sad. 975 _wil and weri_, lonely and weary. _Wil_ literally signifies
astray, _wild_, from the verb _wille_, to go astray. See Gloss. to Allit.
Poems, s.v. _Wyl_.

 "He is hirde, we ben sep;
  Silden he us wille,
  If we heren to his word
  √∞at we ne gon nowor _wille_."‚Äî(O.E. Miscell. p. 2.)

 "And child Jesus _willed_ them fra."‚Äî(Met. Hom. p. 108.)

977

  _wiste hire drogen sori for √∞rist._
  Knew her to be suffering sorely for thirst.

_drogen_ may be an error for _drogende_ = suffering. _sori_ as an adjective
is not sorrowful, as most editors interpret the word, but heavy, painful,
and hence anxious, etc. See l. 974.

 "Quen thai him (Jesus) missed, thai him soht
  Imang thair kith and fand him noht,
  And forthi Joseph and Mari
  War for him sorful and _sari_."‚Äî(Met. Hom. 108.)

978 _quemede hire list_, satisfied her desire.


P. 29. l. 984 _folc frigti_, formidable folk, _frigti_ does not here
signify, as in other parts of the poem, _afraid_, but _to be feared_. 991
_in sunder run_, secret speech or secret communing, private conversation.
See O.E. Hom. 2nd S. p. 29. 1010 _√∞e ton_ = the one. _ton_ = that one the
first; _to√∞er_ = that other, the second.


P. 30. l. 1019 _quamede_ = _quemede_, pleased.

1021-1024

  Quoth this one, "this time next year,
  Shall I appear to thee here;
  By that time shall bliss befall Sarah,
  That she shall of a son conceive."

1026

  _And it hire √∞ogte a selli √∞hing_,
  And it appeared to her a marvellous thing.

1028 _on wane_, wanting one, _i.e._ one less. "In √æis burh was wuniende a
meiden swi√∞e »ùung of »ùeres, _two wone_ of twenti."‚Äî(St. Kath. 69.)

1032

  _And it wur√∞ so√∞ binnen swilc sel_,
  And it became so (came to pass) within such time.

1035 _stelen_ = go away stealthily or secretly.

1036

  _Ne min dede abraham helen_,    Nor my deed from Abraham hide.

1037 _sinne dwale_ = complaint of sin (see l. 1220); _dwale_ may be taken
as an adj. = grievous, mischievous. 1038 _miries dale_, an error for _mirie
dale_ = pleasant dale.  See l. 1121.

1039-40

  _√∞o adde abram-is herte sor,
  for loth his newe wunede √∞or_,
  Then had Abraham's heart grief,
  For Lot, his nephew, dwelt there.

1041-4 "Lord," quoth he, "how shalt thou do (this), if thou shalt take
vengeance thereon; shalt thou not the righteous protect (spare), or for
them (for their sake) to the others mercy bear (show)?" _me√∞ beren_ = to
bear mercy, to show mercy to. See ll. 1046, 1242.

1046

  _Ic sal me√∞en √∞e stede for √∞o_,
  I shall have mercy upon the place for those (for their sake).

_Me√∞en_ signifies to use gently, act with moderation towards any one, to
compassionate, to show mercy to. (See Allit. Poems, p. 45, l. 247; p. 51,
l. 436; p. 54, l. 565; O.E. Hom. 2nd S. p. 153.) 1049 _at-wot_, departed.
There is no such verb as _√¶t-w√≠tan_, to depart, in Bosworth's A.Sax. Dict.
The only meaning given to _atwiten_ by Stratmann is to reproach, twit.
_At-wot_ may be a blunder for _at-wond_, departed. See l. 3058. La»ù. l. 87.
We have the O.E. _at-flegen_, _at-gon_, _at-scape_, etc. The simple verb
_wite_ is not uncommon in Early English authors.

 "The first dai sal al the se
  Boln and ris, and heyer be
  Than ani fel of al the land,
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  And als mikel the tother day
  Sal it sattel and _wit_ away."‚Äî(Met. Hom., p. 25.)

 "When this was sayd, scho _wyte_ away."‚Äî(_Ibid._, p. 169.)

1054 _quake_ is evidently an error for _quate_ = _wait_, look for.


P. 31. l. 1055

  _He ros, and lutte, and scro√∞ him_ [hem?] _wel._
  He rose, and bowed, and urged (invited) them well.

1060

  _He wisten him bergen fro √∞e dead._
  They wished to preserve him from death.

_bergen_ is literally to preserve, but it may be here used passively, as
the infinitive often is by O.E. writers, and we must then render the line
as follows:‚Äî"They wished him to be preserved from death."

1062

  _And he him gulden it euerilc del._
  And they him requited it every whit.

1063

  _Oc al √∞at burgt folc √∞at helde was on._
  But all that townsfolk that were old enough.

1073

  _√∞at folc vn-seli, sinne wod._
  That wretched folk, mad with sin.

1076 _wreche and letting_ = vengeance and failure.

1079

  _Wil si√∞en cam on euerilc on._
  Blindness _or_ bewilderment afterwards came on every one.

1082 _fundend_ = _funden_ + _id_ = _funden_ + _it_ = found it. 1084 _don
red_ = do (obey) counsel, i.e. take advice.


P. 32. l. 1095 _in sel_ = in time, timely, opportunely.

1097

  _√∞at here non wente agen._
  That none of them should turn back.

1101 _gunde under dun_, under yond hill. 1103 _sren_, if correct, might
signify _screen_, but it seems to be an error for _fren_, to set free, and
hence to save.

1105

  _Ai was borgen bala-segor._
  Aye was saved Bela Zoar (little Bela).

See Gen. xiv. 2; xix. 20, 22. 1107 _hine_ = him, the name of the town being
regarded as of the masculine gender. 1108 _er√∞e-dine_ = earthquake.

 "√Å hundyr √° thowsand and se·∫Öyntene yhere
  Fr√° √æe byrth of our Lord dere,
  _Erddyn_ gret in Ytaly
  And hugsum fell all suddanly,
  And fourty dayis fr√° √æine lestand."‚Äî(Wyntown, p. i. 289.)

The verb _dinne_ in O.E. has not only the sense of to _din_, but to shake,
quake. See Seinte Marherete, p. 20.

 "√ûe erth quok and _dind_ again."
      ‚Äî(Cursor Mundi; Cott. MS. Vesp. A. iii. fol. 11b.)

1109 _Sone so_, as soon as. 1110 _brend-fier-rein_, rain of burning fire.

1116

  _Ne mai non dain wassen √∞or-on_,
  None may dare to wash therein.

_dain_, if not an error for _darin_ = _daren_, dare, venture, may = _√∞ain_,
a man, a servant, or = _duen_, avail. 1119 _wente hire a-gon_, turned her
aback. See l. 1097. 1120 _wente in to a ston_, turned into a stone.

1121

  _So ist nu forwent mirie dale_,
  So is there now changed merry (pleasant) dale.

_ist_ = _is_ + _it_, _is it_, there is. 1125 _deades driuen_, held
(influenced) of (by) death.


P. 33. l. 1127 They say the trees that are near it, come to maturity in
time, and bring forth fruit and thrive, but when their apples are ripe,
fire-ashes one may see therein. _fier-isles_, fire-ashes. For the meaning
of _isle_, see Gloss. to Allit. Poems, s.v. _Vsle_. 1131-2 That land is
called dale of salt, many a one taketh thereof little heed (account).

 "Of thair schepe thai gif na _tale_,
  Whether thai be seke or hale."‚Äî(MS. Harl. 4196, fol. 92.)

1137 _biggede_, dwelt. It signifies more properly to _build_. 1139-40 Here
is an allusion to the destruction of the world by fire mentioned in lines
640-644, p. 19. Those maidens erewhile heard some say that fire should all
this world consume. 1140 _forswe√∞en_, to burn up entirely, from the O.E.
_swethe_ or _swithe_, to burn, scorch. See Ancren Riwle, p. 306 (footnote).
Gloss. to Allit. Poems, s.v. _swythe_. 1142 _fieres wreche_, vengeance
(plague) of fire. 1143-4 The Cursor Mundi says that Lot's daughters seeing
only their father, thought that all men had perished.

 "Bot Loth him held √æat cave wit-in,
  He and his doghtres tuin;
  For √æai nan bot √æair fadre sau,
  √ûai wend alle men war don odau,
  Thoru √æat ilk waful wrak;
  √ûe elder to √æe yonger spak:
 'Sister to √æe in dern I sai,
  √ûou seis √æe folk er alle awai;
  Bot Loth our fader es carman (male) nan,
  Bot we twa left es na womman;
  I think mankind sal perist be,
  Bot it be stord wit me and √æe.'"‚Äî(fol. 18.)

1147 _vnder-gon_, (1) to go under, (2) to cheat, deceive.  In line 1160
_under-gon_ = to undertake, take up again.

Cp.

 "»ùet our by-leave wole _onder-gon_,
  That thyse thre (Persons of the Trinity) beth ry»ùt al on."
      ‚Äî(Shoreham, p. 142.)

 "Ope the he»ùe e»ùtynde day
  He _onder-»ùede_ the Gywen lay."‚Äî(Ibid. p. 122.)

 "And tus adam he [Christ] _under-gede_,
  reisede him up, and al mankin,
  √∞at was fallen to helle dim."‚Äî(O.E. Miscell. p. 22.)

1151 _ei√∞er here_, each of them. Cf. O.E. _ei√∞er e»ùe_, each eye, both eyes.
1159-60 Now behoveth us to turn back and take up _the_ song concerning
Abraham.

1162

  _Wi√∞ reuli lote and frigti mod._
  With mournful cheer and frightened mood (mind).

_reuli_ = sad, rueful, from the verb _rue_, to pity, compassionate, grieve
for. Cf. O.E. _rueness_, compassion; _Ruer_, a merciful person; _reuthe_,
pity.

 "He saith 'we ben ybore euerichone
  Making sorwe and _reuly_ mone.'"‚Äî(MS. Addit. 11305.)

_lote_, fare, cheer.

 "√ûis isah √æe leodking
  grimme heore _lates_."

  The king saw this,
  their grim gestures.
      ‚Äî(La»ù. ii., 245.)

 "√ûat freond s√¶i√∞e to freonde,
  mid f√¶ire _loten_ hende,
 'Leofue freond, w√¶s hail!'"

  That friend saieth to his friend
  With fair comely looks,
 "Dear friend, wassail!"
      ‚Äî(_Ibid._ ii., 175.)


P. 34. l. 1163 _Roke_, East Anglian for _reke_, smoke. See Prompt. Parv. p.
436; Beve's, l. 2471.

1164

  _And √∞e brinfires stinken smoke_,
  And the sulphur's stinking smoke.

_stinken_ = _stinkende_, stinking. 1166 _him reu_. The verb _rewe_ is used
impersonally in O.E. 1167 _su√∞en_ = southwards. (See Gen. xx. 1.) 1171-2
Erewhile as first Pharaoh her took, now taketh Abimelech her also. 1177
_wif-kinnes_, womankind. 1178 _wi√∞-hel√∞_ = _wi√∞-held_. 1179-80 In dream to
him came tidings why he suffered and underwent that misfortune. 1180
_untiming_ is literally that which is unseasonable. We have the same notion
expressed in O.E. _unhap_ (mishap), misfortune; E. _happen_, happy, and E.
_hap_, _happen_, etc. Cp. _untime_, in Ancren Riwle, p. 344. 1184 _√∞at il
sel_, that same time, immediately.

1186

  _And his yuel sort was ouer-gon_,
  And his evil lot was passed.

1188

  _√∞a √∞e swinacie gan him nunmor deren_,
  When the quinsy did him no more vex (annoy).

Our author or his transcriber is certainly wrong about the "_swinacie_;"
for the punishment of "_lecher-craft_" was _meselry_ (leprosy), the quinsy
being the penalty for _gluttony_. The seven deadly sins were thus to be
punished in Purgatory:‚Äî


  1. Pride,        by a daily fever.
  2. Covetousness,  " the dropsy.
  3. Sloth,         " the gout.
  4. Envy,          " boils, ulcers, and blains.
  5. Wrath,         " the palsy.
  6. Gluttony,      " the quinsy.
  7. Lechery,       " meselry or leprosy.


1192 _√∞at faire blod_, that fair woman. _blod_ in O.E. was used as a term
of the common gender, as also were such words as _girl_, _maid_, etc. See
Gloss. to Allit. Poems, s.v. _blod_.

1193

  _Bad hire √∞or hir wi√∞ heuod ben hid_
  = _Bad hire √∞or-wi√∞ hir heuod ben hid_?
  Bad her there-with her head to be hid,
  (That is, she was to buy a veil for her head).

1194 _timing_, good-fortune, happiness. See note to line 1180. 1195
_bi-sewen_, be seen. _so_ in this line seems an unnecessary addition of the
scribe's. 1197 _wurd_ = _wur√∞_, became; _on elde wac_, in age weak
(feeble). _Woc_ = weak; the older form is _wac_. See La»ù. ii. 24, 195, 411.

 "Forr icc amm i me sellfenn _wac_,
  & full off unntrummnesse."‚Äî(Orm. ii. 285.)

 "Vor nout make√∞ hire _woc_ but sunne one."
  For nought maketh hir weak but sin only.
      ‚Äî(Ancren Riwle, p. 4.)

See O.E. Miscell. p. 135; ll. 581, 595.

1198 _trimede_ is, perhaps, for _timede_ = _teemed_ = brought forth; if not
it must be referred to O.E. _trumen_. See _trimen_ in l. 1024.


P. 35. l. 1200 _a-buten schoren_ = about shorn, is merely the explanation
of circumcized.

 "O thritte yeir fra he was born,
  was ysmael wen he was _schorn_."‚Äî(Cursor Mundi, fol. 16b.)

1201 _lay_ is another form of _law_. Cf. O.E. _daye_ and _dawe_. 1204 _al
swilk sel_, even at such time. 1206 _is told_, is reckoned. 1208 _fro
teding don_, removed from his mother's care (?). _teding_ = _tending_ (?),
nursing, care, not _te√∞ing_ = _teething_. "_fro teding don_" in the Cursor
Mundi is expressed by the phrase _spaned fra the pap_ = weaned from the
breast.

1209

  _Michel gestninge made abraham_,
  great feasting _or_ entertainment made Abraham.

_gestninge_ (feasting) seems to be the same as the S.Saxon _gistninge_, a
banquet. The original meaning is hospitality; O.E. _gesten_, to entertain a
guest; S.Sax. _gistnen_, to lodge. See Ancren Riwle, p. 288_a_, 414. La»ù.
ii. 172.

1212

  _And ysmael was him vn-swac_,
  And Ishmael was to him (Isaac) disagreeable.

_vn-swac_, displeasing, distasteful. There is no such word as _un-sw√¶c_ to
be found in the A.Sax. glossaries, but we have _sw√¶c_, savour, taste, from
which I have deduced the meaning here given to _un-swac_. See Ancren Riwle,
p. 48, where _spekung_ = _swekung_, and cp. _sw√¶c_, stenc, and hrepung, in
√Ülfric's Hom. i. 138.

1213 _un-framen_, to annoy, from O.E. _frame_, to benefit, to profit.

1216 _Hir was ysmaeles anger lo√∞_, To her was Ishmael's anger displeasing.

1217 _Ghe bi-mente hire to abraham_, She bemoaned her to Abraham. _bimente_
= pret. of _bimene_, to complain, lament.

 "_bimene_ we us, we hauen don wrong."‚Äî(O.E. Miscell. p. 25; see R. of
      Gloucester, p. 490.)

1220 _dwale_, complaint, grief. See l. 1037.

 "Be √æu neuere to bold, to chiden agen oni scold,
  ne mid mani tales to chiden agen alle _dwales_."
      (O.E. Miscell., p. 127. See p. 126, l. 414.)

1221 _rapede_, hastened, hurried away. See Rich. C≈ìur de Lion, 2206.

 "The wretche stiward ne might nowt slape;
  Ac in the morewing he gan up _rape_."‚Äî(Seven Sages, l. 1620.)

 "The king saide, 'I ne have no _rape_ (I am in no hurry)
  For me lest yit ful wel slape.'"‚Äî(Ibid. l. 1631.)

1224

  _In sumertid, In egest sel_,
  In summer time, in the highest time (the hottest season) of the year.

Cp. 'in a _hy»ù_ seysoun.'‚ÄîAllit. Poems, p. 2, l. 39. 1228 _hete gram_,
fierce heat. 1229 _wexon √∞rist_. The sense requires us to read _wex on
√∞rist_, with fatigue and heat thirst waxed on them.

1231

  _Tid-like hem gan √∞at water laken_,
  Soon did that water fail them.


P. 36. l. 1238

  _Bi al-so fer so a boge mai ten_,
  By as far as a bow may reach.

1239 _sik and sor_, sighing and sadness. 1241 _dede hire reed_, brought her
help.

1242

  _An angel me√∞ede hire √∞at ned_,
  An angel alleviated her distress.

_hire_ is the dative of the personal pronoun. 1244 _seli timing_, a
fortunate occurrence. See note to l. 1180. 1247 _nam fro √∞an_, went from
that place. _fro √∞an_ = Sc. _fra thine_, from thence. 1252 _mikil and rif_,
great (powerful) and wide-spread. 1254 In Arabia his kin dwell. 1258
_kungriche_ = _kineriche_, kingdom. Cf. _kungdom_ = _kunedon_ = kingdom, l.
1260. _kunglond_, _kunelond_ = _kinglond_, kingdom, l. 1262. _guglond_ =
_kunglond_, kingdom, l. 1264.

1261-2

  His ninth son was Tema,
  Wherefore is there a kingdom called Teman.

1264

  _Het a guglond esten_ (eften ?) _fro √∞a_,
  Was called a kingdom afterwards from that time.

_esten fro √∞a_ = eastwards from those _other kingdoms_. 1269 _siker pligt_,
firm, sure pledge.


P. 37. l. 1275 _feren pligt_, pledged fellows.

1279

  _√∞og [it] was nogt is kinde lond_,
  Nevertheless it was not his native land.

1280

  _Richere he it leet √∞an he it fond_,
  richer he left it than he found it.

1290

  _On an hil √∞or ic sal taunen √∞e_,
  on a hill where I shall show thee.

1292 _√∞at he bed him two_ [to ?], that he commanded him to go to. _two_, an
error for _to_. See l. 3752. 1295-6 They say on that hill's side was made
the temple of Solomon. 1295 _dune-is si√∞en_ = _dune-is siden_, down's
(hill's) sides. 1299 _buxum o rigt_, rightly obedient. 1301 _sagt_, an
error for _sag_ (saw). See l. 1334.


P. 38. l. 1308

  _√∞o wur√∞ √∞e child witter and war_,
  Then became the child wise and wary.

1315-20

  Wonderfully art thou in the world come,
  Wonderfully shalt thou be hence taken;
  Without long suffering and fight (struggle)
  God will thee take from world's night,
  And of thyself holocaust have,
  Thank Him that He would it crave (demand).

1317 _√∞hrowing_ = _throe_, suffering, agony.

 "_√∞rowwinge_ and pine."‚Äî(Orm. ii. 174.)

"Vor so√∞ wisdom is don euere soule-hele biuoren flesches hele: and hwon me
ne mei nout bo√∞e holden somed, cheosen er licomes hurt √æen √æuruh to stronge
vondunges, soule _√ærowunge_."‚Äî(Ancren Riwle, p. 372.) For true wisdom is
ever to put soul-health before flesh-health, and when one may not hold both
together, to choose rather bodily hurt than, through too strong trials,
soul-agony (death). 1323 Supply _don_ after _wulde_. 1328 _nuge_ = _nog_,
now. 1331 _frigti fagen_ may be either _frigti and fagen_, timid _and_
glad, or else _frigti-fagen_, timidly glad.

1332 _for ysaac bi-leaf un-slagen_, for Isaac remained unslain.

1333 _Bi-aften_, behind, abaft.

 "Tacc √æ√¶r an shep _bafftenn_ √æin bacc
  and offre itt forr √æe wennchell."‚Äî(Orm. ii. 156.)

1336 _on ysaac stede_, instead of Isaac.


P. 39. l. 1345

  _Sarra was fagen in kindes wune_,    Sarah was naturally glad.

_in kindes wune_ = after the manner of kinde (nature); _kindes wune_ =
kind-wise, kin-wise. 1365 _seme√∞_ is an error for _semes_, burdens, loads,
or for _semed_, burdened, loaded. See l. 1368. _seme_ is properly a load
for a pack-horse.

 "An hors is strengur than a mon,
  Ac for hit non i-wit ne kon,
  Hit berth on rugge grete _semes_,
  And dra»ùth bi-vore grete temes."
      ‚Äî(Owl and Nightingale, ed. Wright, p. 27.)

1372 _min erdne √∞u for√∞e sel√∞helike_, mine errand do thou perform,
accomplish successfully. _for√∞e_ = _for√∞en_.   See Orm. l. 1834; Ancren
Riwle, p. 408; La»ù. l. 31561. 1373 _lene_, grant, still exists in _lend_,
_loan_, etc.

1375

  _He bad hise bede on good sel_,
  He offered his prayer (in good time) opportunely.


P. 40. l. 1379 _ilc on_ = each one.

1382

  _Ne wor nogt so for√∞ √∞euwe numen_,
  The custom had not been so forth (up to that time) practised.

1388 _bofte_ = _bi-ofte_, behoof; cf. O.E. _byef√æe_, _bi-of√æe_.   See l.
1408. 1390 _beges_ = bracelets, armlets, probably from A.Sax. _bugan_ (=
_beogan_), to bow, to bend. The original meaning of _beg_ is crown. In
Piers Ploughman 346, _beighe_ signifies a collar. In the Middle High German
version of the Book of Genesis (ed. Diemer) it is stated that Eliezer, for
love, gave Rebekah

 "Zw√™ne √¥ringe
  und zu√™ne arm-_pouge_
  √ªz alr√¥teme golde."

1391 _ghe_ seems to be an error for _he_. 1394 _kiddit_ = made it known,
showed it. 1397 _good gri√∞_ = good entertainment. 1398 _Him_ (the dative of
the personal pronoun), for him.

1404

  _Quilc sel√∞e and wel√∞he him wel bi-cam_,
  What prosperity and wealth had well befallen him.

1409 _wi√∞-√∞an_, with-that, thereupon.

1410

  _fagneden wel √∞is sondere man_,
  welcomed well this messenger.

_fagnen_ is literally to make _fain_ or glad, to welcome, entertain;
_sondere man_. The proper form is _sondes-man_.    Ancren Riwle, p. 190.
Cf. _loder-man_ for _lodes-man_, l. 4110, p. 117; and _sander-bodes_, O.E.
Hom. 2nd S. p. 89.


P. 41. ll. 1411-12

  When God hath it so ordained,
  As he sendeth so it shall be.

1417 _garen_, to prepare (to set out), to make _yare_, to get ready.

1419-20

  For entreaty nor meed not would he there.
  Over one night delay no (any) more.

_drechen_ is (1) to trouble, annoy, (2) to hinder, delay.

  (1) "Sir Pilates wife dame Porcula
  Tille hir Lord thus gan say‚Äî
 'Deme »ùe noght Ihesus tille ne fra,
  Bot menske him that »ùe may
  I have bene _drechid_ with dremes swa,
  This ilk night als I lay.'"
      ‚Äî(Gospel of Nichodemus, Harl. MS. 4196.)

  (2) "Quhen Claudius √æe manhed kend
  Of √æe Brettownys, he message send
  Tyl Ar·∫Öyragus, √æan √æe kyng
  √ûat Brettayne had in governyng,
  For til amese all were and stryfe,
  And tak his dochtyr til his wyfe,
  And to Rowme √æat Tribwte pay
  Wycht-owtyn _drychyng_ or delay."‚Äî(Wyntown, vol. i. p. 92.)

In the Cursor Mundi we are told that _wanhope_ (despair) causes

 "Lathnes to kirc at sermon here
  _Dreching_ o scrift (delay of shrift)," etc.‚Äî(Cott. MS. Vesp. A. iii.)

1427 _Or or_ first ere, i.e. before.  1428 _morgen-giwe_ = _morgen-giue_,
nuptial gift, the morning gift, the gift of the husband presented to the
wife on the morning after marriage. See Ancren Riwle, p. 94. Hali Meid. p.
39. 1430 _godun dai_, good day. _godun_ = _godne_, the accusative of the
adjective.

 "He let clipie √æe saterday:
  √ûe freres bifore him alle
  And bed alle _godne_ day."‚Äî(St Dunstan, l. 200.)

1434 _sondes fare_, the journey of the messenger (Eliezer).   1437 _on
felde_ = the O.E. _afelde_. 1439 _E√∞√∞ede_ = _e√∞ede_, alleviated, is
connected with the O.E. _e√æe_ (_ea√∞_), easy, and literally signifies
softened. 1440 _Of faiger waspene_, of fair form; _waspene_ is evidently an
error for _wasteme_ or _wastene_. "He seh √æeos seli meiden marherete ... √æe
schimede ant schan al of wlite (face) ant of _wastum_ (form)."‚Äî(Seinte
Marherete, p. 2.) "In √æis burh was wuniende a meiden swi√∞e »ùung of »ùeres,
two wone of twenti, feir ant freolich o wlite & o _westum_."‚Äî(St Kath. p.
69.)   1442 _Here samening_, their union, intercourse.

1444

  _And sge ne bi-spac him neuere a del._
  And she contradicted him never a whit.

_bispeke_ in O.E. also signifies to threaten.   See Castle of Love, l. 221.


P. 42. l. 1448

  _Abraham dede hem si√∞en sundri wunen_,
  Abraham assigned them afterwards sundry abodes.

1456

  _Him bi-stoden wurlike and wel_,
  Mourned for (bewailed) him worthily and well.

See ll. 716, 3857. _wurlike_ = _wur√∞like_, worthily. 1461-4 Long it was ere
she him child bare, And he entreated God, when he became aware of it
(_i.e._ that Rebekah was barren), That he should fulfil that promise, That
he to Abraham erewhile made. 1463 _fillen_, to fulfil, accomplish. See Orm.
i. 91. _quede_, promise, saying, is the same as the O.E. _quede_, a
bequest, _quide_, a saying, from _que√∞e_, to say, still existing in
_quoth_. See La»ù. i. 38, 43; ii. 151, 197, 613 ; iii. 3; Orm. ii. 321.

1467-8

  At one burden she bore
  Two, who were to her akin of blood.

_sibbe blod_ = O.H.G. _sippe-bluot_, blood relatives. Perhaps this line was
inserted by the author on account of the popular belief at this time, that
the birth of twins was an indication of unfaithfulness on the part of the
woman to her husband. 1469-71 Also it seemed to her day and night, As
(though) they wrought in fight (struggling, conflict), Which of them should
first be born. 1470 "And the children struggled together within her."‚Äî(Gen.
xxv. 22.) The following curious paraphrase of this passage occurs in the
Cursor Mundi, fol. 20b:‚Äî

 "His wiif (Rebekah) √æat lang had child forgane,
  Now sco bredes tua for ane,
  Tuinlinges √æat hir thoght na gamen,
  √ûat in hir womb oft faght samen.
  Swa hard wit-in hir wamb √æai faght,
  √ûat sco ne might rest dai ne naght;
  At pray to Godd ai was sco prest,
  To rede hir quat √æat hir was best;
  √ûat hir war best he wald hir rede.
  Hir liif was likest to √æe ded (death).
  Strang weird was giuen to √æam o were,
  √ûat √æai moght noght √æair strif forbere
  Til √æai had o √æaim-seluen might
  To se quarfor √æat √æai suld fight.
  Fra biginning o √æe werld
  O suilk a wer was never herd,
  Ne suilk a striif o childer tuin
  √ûat lai √æer moder wamb wit-in.
  √ûair strut it was vn-stern stith,
  Wit wrathli wrestes ai√æer writh.
  Bituix unborn a batel blind,
  Suilk an was ferli to find.
  He √æat on √æe right side lai
  √ûe tother him wraisted oft awai;
  And he √æat lay upon √æe left,
  √ûe tother oft his sted him reft."

1470 _and_ = _an_ = in; or else _figt_ must be an error for _fagt_ =
fought; and _nigt_ = _nagt_. 1477 _Ghe_ is evidently an error for _ghet_ or
_get_, yet. _liues_ = alive. Cf. _newes_, anew, etc.


P. 43. l. 1484 _swete mel_, sweet meal (food), not sweet speech. "And Isaac
loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison."‚Äî(Gen. xxv. 28.) 1487 _se√∞ a
mete_, sod a meat. "sod pottage."‚Äî(Gen. xxv. 29.) 1493 _mattilike weri_ =
_mattilike and weri_, overcome (faint) and weary. _Mattilike_ is connected
with the O.E. _mat_, _mote_, faint, half dead. See Allit. Poems, p. 12, l.
386.

1494

  _Iacob wur√∞ war he was gredi_,
  Jacob became aware that he (Esau) was hungry.
        ‚Äî(See Gloss. s.v. _Gredi_.)

1495-6 "Brother," quoth he, "sell me those privileges Which are said to be
the first (eldest) son's." 1499 _bli√∞elike_, quickly; _blithelike_ has
often this sense in O.E. writers. 1501 _wur√∞i wune_, a worthy (high, great)
privilege. 1503 _offrende sel_, offering time.

1504

  _Was wune ben scrid semelike and wel_,
  Was wont to be clothed seemly and well.

1506 _dede his ending_, came to his end (died). 1507 _heg tide_, hey (high)
days. 1510 _twinne del_, two-fold. 1511-12 And when the father were (should
be) buried, to have two portions of hereditary property. _ereward_ =
_erfeward_, is properly the guardian, keeper of the _erfe_ or inheritance,
and hence the heir, so that instead of _ereward riche_ we ought to read
_ereward-riche_, corresponding to the A.Sax. _yrfe-land_, hereditary land.
The _-riche_ is the affix found in O.E. _heven-riche_, heaven kingdom;
_kine-riche_, a kingdom; E. _bishoprick_. The _-ward_ (in _ereward_) =
_warder_, keeper, is found in O.E. _gate-ward_, _dore-ward_ (door-keeper),
_bat-ward_ (boat-keeper); _hey-ward_ (farm-yard keeper); _sti-ward_
(steward, the officer who originally had care of the highways or _sties_?).


P. 44. l. 1514 _then_, an error for _ten_, to go. 1515 _in wis_, in wise,
so that; but may we not read _in-wis_ = _i-wis_, indeed, truly? See l.
2521. 1518 _Holden wur√∞elike_, esteemed honourably, held in honour,
respect; _a_ may be for _and_, or for _aa_ = _aye_, ever.

1519-20

  A hundred times as much waxed his honour,
  So may God prosper where he will.

1521

  _Ni√∞ede √∞at folk_ [√∞at] _him fel wel_,
  That folk envied him because he prospered.

1522 And made him change his abode; _flitten_ is to remove, to _flit_.

 "O land he (Noe) had ful grette plent√©,
  For him and for his sons thre;
  Mast to tilth he gave him √æan,
  To _flitt_ √æe breres he bigan;
  Sua lang wit _flitting_ he √æam sloght,
  √ûat wine-treis he √æam wroght."
      ‚Äî(Cursor Mundi, fol. 13.)

1524 _trew√∞e fest_, _troth-fast_, pledged by troth or plighted faith;
_fest_ has usually the sense of confirming, pledging, in O.E.

 "√ûis neu forward (covenant) was _festened_ √æan."
      ‚Äî(Cursor Mundi, fol. 23.)

1527-28

  And age came upon Isaac,
  _He_ became sightless and weak of (with) age.

_elde swac_ = _eldes wac_, weak of (with) age. 1531 _√∞at_, what. 1535
_brogtes_, brought them. 1536 And she well knew the father's choice; _kire_
answers exactly to the later gloss, _wune_ = what is chosen, selected; S.
Sax. _cure_, choice.

 "√ûer stoden in √æere temple
  ten √æusend monnen
  √æet wes √æe bezste _cure_
  Of al Brut-londe."‚ÄîLa»ù. i. 345.

1537 And made exceedingly good, or very opportunely, that meat; _on sele_ =
_on-sele_, good, literally timely, opportunely; S.Sax. _on sele_, safely.
See note on l. 1542.

 "Cnihtes fuse√∞ me mid
  lete√∞ sl√¶pen √æene king
  And fare we _on sele_."‚ÄîLa»ù. i. 32.

  s√¶-men √¶fter
  f√≥ron fl√≥d-w√©ge
  folc w√¶s _on salum_.

  _The_ sea men after
  marched the flood way
  _the_ folk prospered (was in prosperity).
      ‚Äî(C√¶dmon, 184, 13.)

1539 Clothed she Jacob and made him rough. 1542 _seles mel_, an error for
_selie mel_, good (timely) meal? Cf. _miries dale_ for _mirie dale_, l.
1038, p. 30. See La»ù. i. 75; ii. 173.

 "And √æas word saide
  Brutus √æe _sele_ (the good)."‚ÄîLa»ù. i. 30.

 "haue√∞ mi fader bi √æ√¶re s√¶
  Castel swi√∞e _s√¶le_."‚Äî(_Ibid._ ii. 14.)

1544 For he handled him and found him rough. 1545 When he knew him,
opportunely he blessed him, faithfully and well. _on gode sel_, in good
time, opportunely. See note to l. 1542.


P. 45. ll. 1547-8

  Heaven's dew and earth's fatness,
  Abundance of wine and oil.

1550 Supply _and_ after _migt_.

1565-6

  Quoth Esau, "right is his name
  Called Jacob, to my disadvantage."

1569-70

  Nevertheless, dear father, intreat I thee
  That thou give me some blessing.

1573 _er√∞es smere_, earth's fatness; _smere_ is properly _fat_, grease,
butter. In the Orm. ii. 106 it is used in the sense of ointment. 1574
granted him blessing that was precious to him; _gere_ is evidently an error
for _dere_, beloved, dear, precious.

1575-6

  For Idumea, that rich land,
  Of pasture good, was in his hand.

_lewse_, cf. O.E. _leswen_, to pasture; _lezzer_[398] (Shropshire), a
pasture-land. (Wicliffe, 1 Kings xvi. 11; 1 Cor. ix. 7; Luke viii. 34.) "If
ony man schal entre by me, he schal be saved; and he schal go yn, and schal
go out, and he schal fynde _lesewis_." (Wicliffe, St John x. 9.) "Egipte
a»ùenst kynde of o√æer londes ha√æ plent√© of corn; he is bareyne of _lesue_,
and whan he ha√æ plent√© of _lesue_ it is bareyne of corn." (Trevisa's
translation of Higden's Polychronicon, vol. 1, p. 131.)

1577-8

  Quoth Esau, "_The time of_ mourning shall pass away,
  And _I_ shall take vengeance of (on) Jacob."

1577 _grot_ is a noun formed from the vb. to _grete_ (to weep, mourn), just
as _wop_ is from _wepe_ (weep). It is the same as the O.E. _gret_, _grete_,
cry, outcry.


P. 46. ll. 1583-4

 "Be thou there," quoth she, "till Esau
  Appeased be, who rages now."

_E√∞e-mo√∞ed_ (= _e√∞e-moded_) is literally easy-minded, humble, mild, and
hence soft-mooded, appeased. S.Sax. _edmod_, _eadmodied_, _edmodie_. See
La»ù. ii. 554; Ancren Riwle, 246, 278. The insertion of _be_ is necessary to
the metre as well as to the sense.

1588-9

  Esau married _in order_ to annoy us
  When he allied (himself to kin of Canaan) and is so foolish.

1591-2

  Wherefore he maketh him stubborn and strong,
  For he is mixed amongst that kin.

1594

  _Ne bode ic no lengere werldes lif_,
  I could endure (abide) no longer world's life.

1605 _an so√∞e drem_, in true dream. 1606 _heuene bem_ = heaven-beam (?),
the sun (?). 1610 _Lened_ = leaned; but the MS. also sanctions _leued_ =
remained; _and [Jacob] wur√∞ ut-suuen_, and Jacob became cast out of
(aroused from) _his sleep_. 1615 _i_ = _ic_, I. It is common to find _i_
before _sal_, instead of the fuller _ic_.


P. 47. l. 1620 _amongus_ = _amonges_ = amongst. 1621 _a-gen cumen_ =
_agen-cumen_, return. 1623 _for muniging_ = for _a_ memorial. 1624 _And get
on olige_ = and poured on oil; _olige_ = the O.E. _olie_, _elye_ = oil;
_anelye_, to anoint. 1636 A well well-covered under a stone. 1638 _abiden_
(= abode) is the pret. pl. of _abide_. 1641 _sulden samen_ = should
assemble.

1649

  _Iacob wi√∞ hire wente √∞at ston_,
  Jacob for her removed that stone.

_wi√∞_ in O.E. signifies in, for, against, etc.

1651-2

  And he made known he was her aunt's son,
  And kissed her after kins-wise (as a relative).

_mouies_ is properly a female relative; S.Sax. _mawe_, _mo»ùe_, _mowe_, and
must be distinguished from _m√¶i_, _mey_, _may_, etc., a male relative. "√ûis
»ùet √æunche√∞ me wurst √æ√¶t tu √æe ane hauest ouergan √æi feder ant ti moder,
_meies_ ba ant _mehen_." (St Marherete, p. 16.)

 "Nu is afered of √æe
  √æi _mei_ and √æi _mowe_;
  Alle heo were√∞ √æe weden
  √æat er weren √æin owe."‚Äî(O.E. Miscell. p. 178.)

We occasionally, as in this instance, meet with the word in a more limited
sense.

 "Annd hire _me»ùhe_ Elysabae√æ
  Wass gladd inoh & bli√æe
  Off hire dere child Iohan,
  And lefli»ù »ùho himm fedd."‚Äî(Orm. i. 109.)

 "Has √æou her," √æai said, "ani man,
  Sun or dogter, mik or _mau_
  To √æe langand, or hei or lau."‚Äî(Cursor Mundi, fol. 17.)

We even find a confusion between the two terms, as in l. 1761, p. 51, and
in the following passage:

 "Loth went and til his _maues_ (sons-in-law) spak."
      ‚Äî(Cursor Mundi, fol. 17.)


P. 48. ll. 1655-6 Laban welcomed him (Isaac's son travelled from afar) in
friend's wise (friendly); _feren_ = S.Sax. _feorren_, afar, far, from a
distance. (See Ancren Riwle, p. 70, l. 3888.)

 "The sonne, and monne, and many sterren
  By easte aryseth swythe _ferren_."‚Äî(Shoreham, p. 137.)

1658 _and laban herte ranc_ = and Laban's heart was wrung (with pity)? for
_ranc_ read _wranc_ = _wrang_. 1666 _wa√∞_ = _qua√∞_, quoth, spoke. 1668 _wi√∞
skil_, in reason, reasonably.

1671

  _Luue wel michil it agte a-wold_
  Love so great it ought prevail.

_agte awold_, have in power, prevail, avail. Cp. "√ûerfore everyche Romayn
overcome√æ o√æer is overcome wi√æ flaterynge and wi√æ faire wordes; and »ùif
wordes faille√æ, »ùiftes schal hym _awelde_." (Trevisa's translation of
Higden's Polychronicum, vol. i. p. 253.) 1676 _tog_ = _toc_ = took.

1681

  _long wune is her driuen_,
  long custom is here held (practised).


P. 49. l. 1693 _londes kire_, custom of the land (country). 1700 _caldes_,

withered.  _drugte numen_, seized with drought (dryness).

P. 61. l. 2114 Who could explain the meaning of these dreams. 2119 _√∞o
hogt_. Is _hogt_ an error for _logt_ = _lagt_, taken, or for _sogt_ =
sought? 2122 _√∞is dremes wold_ = this dream's meaning. _Wold_ signifies (1)
power, (2) force, (3) meaning. 2130 _nedful_ = grievous; the O.E. _ned_

2178 _bi gure bering_, by your behaviour. 2181 For seldom betideth even any

of us; _ur_ should be properly _ure_. Cf. l. 2260, where we have _gur_ for
_gure_.

2267-8

  Very glad (fain) he was of their coming,
  For he was held there as a prisoner.

_to nome_ may have the same signification as the phrase _to wedde_ = as
hostage, as security; _nome_ (_nom_?), derived from _nimen_, to take,
capture, signifies seizure. Cf. _wop_ from _wepe_ (weep), _grot_ from
_grete_ (lament, cry), _lop_ (flee) from _lepe_ (leap, run), etc. 2269
_vndren time_ = A.Sax. _undern-tid_; _vndren_ is the Prov. _aandorn_,
_oandurth_, _orndorn_. It literally denotes "the intervening period, which
accounts for its sometimes denoting a part of the forenoon, or a meal taken
at that time, and sometimes a period between noon and sunset."‚Äî(Garnett.)
2275 And he willingly accepted it. 2279 Know I that none of them but what

  That all his face became wet with tears.

  That hi wel understonde schulde
  That sum _unselthe_ heom is i-hende (near)."

Later writers use the word in the sense of wickedness. (See Shoreham's

491. 2318 _gure on_ = one of you. 2320 _vp_ = _vpe_ = _upon_.

P. 69. l. 2399 _derer_, an error for _der√´_ = beloved. 2400 How many years

P. 70. l. 2435 _Or √∞an_ = ere that.

2441-3

  Joseph caused his body to be honourably prepared (for burial),
  To be washed, richly anointed,
  And with spices to be scented.

_Smaken_ usually signifies to taste, savour, but here means to scent, to be
scented. _Smac_ in the Owl and Night., 821, is used for scent, while in the
Ayenbite of Inwyt it has the sense of flavour.

 "Zalt yef√æ _smac_ to √æe mete."

See Gloss. to Allit. Poems, s. v. _Smach_.

2444-9

  And Egypt's folk him bewaked,
  Forty nights and forty days,
  Such were Egypt's laws;
  _The_ first nine nights the bodies they bathe,
  And anoint, and shroud, and bewail
  And watch them afterwards forty nights.

2451-5

  And Hebrew folk had a custom,
  Not immediately to bury it with iron,
  But to wash it (the corpse) and keep it right,
  Without anointing, seven nights,
  And afterwards (keep it) anointed thirty days.

2452 _yre_ = iron; O.E. _ire_, _iren_ (Owl and Night. 1028). The form
_ize_, iron, is also met with in O.E. writers. (See Ayenbite, pp. 110,
133.) 2454 _smerles_, ointment, belongs to the same class of words as
_feteles_, a vessel, _reckeles_, incense, etc. "√æe _smeryels_ ne is na»ùt
wor√æ to hele √æe wonde ne non o√æer √æing √æer huile √æet √æet yzen is
√æerinne."‚Äî(Ayenbite, p. 174.)

2459-60

  For truth and with good deeds,
  Done is then all that watch-deed.

2460 _wech-dede_, vigils. 2463 And some every year as it happens or comes
round. 2465 Do for the dead church-going; _chirche-gong_ = church-going.

 "√ûe gret cyte of Medes su√æ√æe afure he (William) sette,
  Vor me (one) ne my»ùte non _chyrche gong_ wy√æ out ly»ùte do."
      ‚Äî(R. of Gloucester, p. 380.)

2467 And that is instead of the vigils.


P. 71. l. 2472 _daiges_ is evidently an error for _laiges_, laws. See l.
2456. 2479 _wis of here[n]_, skilful in arms. 2487 _ouer-pharan_ =
_ouer-faren_, pass over _or_ beyond Pharan. 2488 _in biriele don_, put into
the tomb. "And whanne Jhesus hadde comen over the water at the cuntre of
men of Genazereth, twey men havynge develis runnen to him, goynge out fro
_birielis_ (tombs), ful feerse, _or wickid_, so that no man mi»ùte passe by
that way."‚Äî(Wicliffe, St. Matt. viii. 28.) 2498 _To be√∞en me√∞e_, to
supplicate for mercy; _be√∞en_ may be an error for _beden_, to entreat,
_bedden oc_ = _beoden oth_ = to offer oath [of obedience].


P. 72. l. 2505-12

 "It shall," quoth he, "be fulfilled
  What God before hath to our elders sworn;
  He shall lead you in his hand
  Hence to that promised land;
  For God's love I yet entreat you;
  Perform it (my prayer) then, promise it now
  That my petition shall not be lost (sight of);
  With you let my bones be borne.

2510 _Lested_ = _leste√∞_, perform. 2514 God bring the soul into bliss. 2516
_egipte-like_, after the custom of the Egyptians. 2521 _to ful in wis_ =
_to ful-iwis_, very full (completely), indeed. See l. 109. Orm uses the
word _fuliwis_, _ful iwiss_, _fuli»ùwiss_, in the sense of certainly, truly.
See Gloss. to Orm, s. v. _fuliwis_. 2524 _for lefful soules ned_, for the
need of faithful souls. 2528 May God help him kindly (joyfully). For the
meaning of _weli_ see Gloss. to Allit. Poems, s. v. _wely_. 2529 And
preserve his soul from sorrow and tears. 2532 God grant them in his bliss
to have pleasure; _spilen_ signifies to sport, live pleasantly.

 "√ûan was Uortigerne √æa king
    in Cantuarie-buri.
  √ûer he mid his hirede,
    h√¶hliche _spilede_ (nobly diverted themselves)."
      ‚Äî(La»ù. ii. 153.)

 "d√¢ was _spil_ unde wunne
  under w√Æben unde manne.
  vone benche ze benche
  hiez man all√ªteren w√Æn scenchen:
  Si _spilten_ unde trunchan

      ‚Äî(M.H.G. version of Genesis and Exodus, ed. Deimer.)


P. 73. l. 2544 _hatel_, severe, cruel. See Gloss. to Allit. Poems, s. v.
_Hatel_. 2546 _seli si√∞_, prosperity. 2547 Quoth (spoke) this king with
them, secretly, in council. 2548 _michil sped_ = great speed, rapidly. 2553
_feten_ seems to be an error for _seten_, made. 2555 _vn-√∞ewed swinc_,
unaccustomed (extraordinary) labour; _vn-√∞ewed_ also signifies immoral,
wicked. See Orm. i. 74, Allit. Poems, B, l. 190. 2556 _fugel_ = _ful_,
foul, loathsome. 2560 They caused them to creep along (or through) dikes;
_dikes_ = O.E. _diches_, may here signify subterraneous passages, burrows;
or perhaps _dikes_ = sewers, from the allusion to _muc_ and _fen_. "And
Jhesus said to him, Foxes han _dichis_, or _borowis_, and briddis of the
eir han nestis, but mannes sone hath not where he reste his
heued."-(Wicliffe, St. Matt. viii. 20.)

2561-2

  And come where none had been before.

2564 _comb_, crest or top (?). 2567 _√∞hogen_ = _√∞ogen_, throve. See l.
2542.


P. 74. l. 2575 But they disobeyed from fear of God. 2578 They defended
themselves with lies.

2581-2

  God requited it these women well,
  On _their_ homes, _their_ wealth, _a_ happy time.

_eddi sel_ is, literally, pleasant time, but may here denote prosperity,
success, etc. 2583 _opelike_ = openlike, openly. 2588 _Abraham_ is an error
for _Amram_, _i.e._ Amram was Moses' first name. 2590 _dreful and ble√∞_,
sorrowful and afraid; _ble√∞_. In A.Sax. _blea√∞_ = gentle, slow; _bl√¶t_ =
miserable; the S.Sax. _bl√¶√∞_ = destitute, poor; _bli√∞ere_, cowardlier. 2594
Nor could she take him stealthily (secretly) of (from) the water; or
_stelen_ may signify to still, to quiet. 2595 _rigesses_ = rushes. Cf. Sc.
_reesk_, _reyss_. 2596 _terred_ = _tarred_, pitched.


P. 75. l. 2609-10

  God had such beauty him given,
  That the very foes let him live.

2611-5

  Egypt's women came near,
  And bad _her_ leave the child there,
  But she took it away with a cry (scream);
  Of their command took she no heed.

2613-4 _he_ = _ghe_ = she. It cannot be the plural _he_ = they, for this
would require _namen_ instead of _nam_. 2621 On whose _teat_ (paps) he soon
hath seized. 2629 _on sunes stede_, instead of a son. See l. 2637. 2639
_ayne_ [= _ane_] _stund_, one minute. 2644 _√∞is timing_ = this occurrence,
this timely assistance.


P. 76. l. 2647-8

  If help had not run between
  This child had then soon been killed.

2650-8 He said, "The child doth as he knows (_i. e._ acts according to the
extent of his knowledge); we shall now learn whether it did this wittingly,
or in childishness." He offered this child two burning coals, and he took
them; how was he able to bear it? and in his mouth so deep he placed them,
that his tongue's end is burnt therewith; therefore said the Hebrews truly
that he afterwards spake indistinctly. This legend is thus given in Lady
Eastlake's Life of Our Lord:‚Äî"Therefore when he (Moses) was three years of
age she (Thermutis) brought him to Pharaoh, who caressed him, and in sport,
put the crown on his head, when the child eagerly pulled it off, and dashed
it to the ground; for it is said that the crown was engraved within with
figures of idols, which Moses instinctively abominated.... Those around
Pharaoh looked upon it as a bad omen, and they counselled the king that he
should be slain; but another counsellor said that he should be pardoned,
because he was too young to know right from wrong; and a third counsellor
said, 'There is in this child something miraculous and uncommon. Cause,
therefore, a burning coal and a ruby ring to be set before him; and if he
take the ring it will show that he knows right from wrong, and then let him
be destroyed, lest he spoil the kingdom of Egypt. But if he take up the
burning coal, it will show that he is too young to know right from wrong,
and then let his life be spared.' Then the king said, 'Let the hot burning
coal and the king's signet ring (which was a large shining ruby) be placed
side by side, and we shall see what he will do.' And immediately the child
stretched out his hand to take the signet ring; but the angel Gabriel (who
instantly took the form of one of the attendants) turned his hand aside,
and the child Moses took up the burning coal, and put it to his mouth, and
his tongue was burnt therewith, so that he was unable afterwards to speak
distinctly, even to the end of his days." 2652 _childhede_; "ac ze√æ√æe ich
com to elde of vol man, ich vorlet alle mine _childhedes_."‚Äî(Ayenbite, p.
208.) 2653 _brennen_ = _brennende_, burning; _to_ = _two_. 2654-5 _is_ =
them. 2658 _miserlike_ = S.Sax. _misliche_, variously, differently; and,
hence, thickly, indistinctly. The form _miser-like_ may be a corruption of
the A.Sax. _missen-lic_, dissimilar. _Misliche_ in Owl and Nightingale, l.
1771, signifies erroneously. 2662 _b[i]leph_ = _bi-lef_, remained.

2665-8

  By that time that he was a youth (young man)
  With (for) beauty and strength renowned,
  The Ethiopian folk on Egypt came,
  And burnt, and slew, and vengeance took.

2675-8

  Teremuth scarcely might bring it about (prevail)
  That Moses shall with them forth-go,
  Ere she have her pledged and sworn,
  That to him shall be borne (kept) honourable faith.

2676 _hire_, an error for _hem_, them. 2677 _he_ = _ghe_ = she. 2680 _were_
(a substantive from _weren_, to defend), a defender, protector. Cf. _dere_,
harm, from _deren_, to hurt.


P. 77. l. 2682 _vn-warnede_, unexpected. This enables us to correct the
reading _unwarde_ in l. 480. 2688 _ut-√∞hurg_ = out-through, throughout. Cf.
O.E. _ut-with_, without, _in-with_, within, etc. 2696 Nevertheless that
sojourn was very distasteful to him. 2701 _meten_ is the p.p. of _mete_, to
measure. 2702 _This_ causes remembrance, _the other_ causes forgetfulness.
2703 _He fest is_ = he fixed them. 2704 Gave her the first _gem_; he was
kind to her. Two lines seem missing after this line. We might supply the
following:‚Äî

  And quan awei nimen [faren] he wolde
  Gaf hire √∞e to√∞er, he was hire colde.

And when he would go away, he gave her the other gem, and was distasteful
to her. 2708 _e_ = he. 2712 _a modi stiward_, a moody (proud) steward. 2714
That seemed to Moses _a_ great shame.


P. 78. ll. 2718-20

  And secretly he buried him in the sand,
  He weened that no Egyptian
  Had known it, or should have seen it.

2720 _a sen_ may signify 'have seen.'  Northumbrian _ha_, to have; but more
probably we should read _a-sen_, to see, the infinitive being required
after _sulde_, so that _sulde a-sen_ = should see. In the Romans of King
Alysaundre _asen_ occurs as the p.p. of _a-see_, to see.  Cf. our modern
words _wake_ and _awake_, _rise_ and _arise_, etc. These double forms were
far more common in O.E. writers than in the modern stage of our language.
2727 And enquired _of_ him what it should mean.   2730 _to rad_, too hasty.
2736 _his weige √∞e√∞en ches_ = chose (took) his way thence.

 "Ac thar lond is bothe _este_ and god."
      ‚Äî(Owl and Nightingale, p. 36, l. 1029.)

2764 To wife in law he her took; _in lage_ = in law, in marriage, is an
early use of a common phrase. 2769 And Moses had gone on a time. 2771 To
look after the condition of the herds. 2775 _brennen_ = _brennende_. See l.
2653. 2776 And nevertheless green and whole remained. 2783 _in min geming_,

contrary. 2803 _to token_, for a token (sign). Cf. _to wedde_, for a
pledge, etc. 2812 _fer_, sound, and hence _unfer_ (l. 2810), diseased. (See
Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight, l. 103; Ormulum, i. 41, 153, 212.) 2815
_get_ = pour (see l. 582). 2817 _wanmol_ = un-eloquent; _wan_ occurs in
O.E. _wan-hope_, despair; _wan-trauthe_, disbelief; _mol_ is the same as
_moal_ (speech) in l. 81, p. 3; _vn-reken_ = un-ready, slow. (See Gloss. to

  & cleopeden Crist, godes sune,

  I defended so that thou wast rescued,
  And laboured, and great sorrow endured,
  Yet is it unseen (is it a secret) how I accomplished it?

(Ps. xxvi. 5). 2890 _to gode_, for good, gratuitously. 2891-2 And yet they

(need). 3153 _wri√∞el_; can it mean _haste_? (see Ex. xii. 11.) At first
sight it seems to be a derivative of _wirt_ (by metathesis _writ_), an
herb; but the mention of _rew mete[n]_ in l. 3151 renders this rather
doubtful. 3154 _bi-leuen_, the remainder. O.E. _lave_, _leve_, the

P. 96. l. 3378 _here √∞ing_, their affairs. 3381 Moses prayed for the folk
_of_ Israel. 3385 For _leth is_ read _let his_. 3388 They supported them
with a stone. 3393 _bode_ seems wanting after _sente_. 3394 Of this
occurrence to have a memorial.


P. 97. l. 3398 _min blis_. Jehovah-nissi is generally explained as "The
Lord is my banner." 3410 _stering_, government, rule; _stere_ in ll. 3418,
3420, rule; _steres_, rulers, ll. 3413, 3415; _steres-men_, rulers, ll.

_ouer-man_, l. 3424. 3413 _tgen_ = _tyen_, ten. See l. 3418. 3414 _Ilc
here_, each of them. 3429-32 He bad them choose rulers, mighty, who are
God-fearing, truth-loving, and who strife and covetousness forsake. 3432
_ni√∞ing_ signifies not only strife, but niggardliness, wickedness,
slaughter, etc. O.E. writers usually employ the word in the sense of a
coward, villain, miser, etc.


P. 98. l. 3434 And willingly (gladly) _he_ received (accepted) it. 3438 _is
numen_, has gone. 3448 May we not read _Ic wile min folc cnowen be_ = I
will be known to my people?

3449-51

  And Moses told this to Israel,
  And they promised him every whit
  What he biddeth them they will do.

3453 _√∞is to daiges_ = these two days. 3458 _wi√∞ goren dragen_ = pierced
with darts.

 "heo beoren on heore honde
  _gares_ [speres], swi√∞e stronge."
      ‚Äî(La»ù. iii. 44.)

3459-60

  These _people_ fearful thus abode,
  While these days forth have passed.

3462 _Spile_, ravage, destruction (see l. 2977). 3463 On this mount stood a
cloud's shadow; _and_ = _an_ = _a_ (see l. 3475).


P. 99. l. 3471-84 Each of you bear in mind, that it is not Moses, Amram's
son, whom ye shall to-day hear speak, but He who slew Egypt (you for to
avenge), and a path made in the sea; and who let Adam discover the tree
which preserved Noah, and led Abraham out into the land of Canaan; who
caused Isaac to be begotten of old Abraham and of Sarah (of old teats); who
gave Isaac (Jacob?) so many sons, and who gave Joseph such rich gifts
(abilities); let His word be to you as precious as life, dearer than either
child or wife.

3488-9

  None might go further except Nun,
  And also his brother Aaron.

3489 _on_ = _one_. It may be an error for _oc_ = also. 3496 My vengeance is
severe, my forbearance is long. 3497 _in idel_, in vain; _idel_ in O.E.
signifies _empty_, _void_. 3498-3500 Nor swear it lyingly to defile in
sport, Nor let thou my honour be lost in the fiend's tempting (_i. e._ in
yielding to the devil's advice).


P. 100. l. 3508 _for truke of_ = for failure of, for want of. 3515 Covet
not thy neighbour's thing. 3518 Thou losest everlasting bliss. 3519
_figeren_ = _fiyeren_ = _feren_, afar. 3533 _nemeld_ = _nemend_ = _nemned_,
named, appointed (?).


P. 101. l. 3545-6 That mad folk there of day brought Hur (_i. e._ put Hur
to death) and put Aaron in fear; 'to don of dawe' = to bringen of dage =
put to death. (See Legend of St. Beket, l. 622; Allit. Poems, p. 9, l.
282.)

 "For quen the childe es born, sal I
  _Do it of daw_ sa priuely,
  That na wiht sal the squeling here,
  And delf it sithen in our herbere."‚Äî(Met. Hom. p. 167.)


P. 102. l. 3573 _for gode_ is frequently employed by Chaucer. 3574 It is a
song wicked and foolish.

3581-2

  And mixed _it_ in _the_ water and poured it off,
  And gave that folk that draff (dregs) to drink.

Cf. O.E. _draff_, chaff. "_Draffe_ or drosse, or mater stampyd, pilumen."
(Prompt. Parv.) Cf. "_draf-sak_." (Chaucer.)

3583-4

  Then wist he well who had done it (committed idolatry),
  Seen it (the dregs) was on their beards.

3603 _milche mo√∞_ = _milce mod_, mild (merciful) mood.

3605-6

  God answered, "Off shall I take them,
  Who are not _worthy_ to be placed thereon."

3607 _min engel on_, my angel alone.


P. 103. l. 3611 _to pligt_, for _their_ sin. 3614 And as sun-beam bright
shone his features. 3624 _wi√∞ witter dragt_, with skilful device. 3626 And
their labour they well apply. 3635 _of lore wal_, of choice lore. 3637
_betten_ = _beten_, amend, from _bet_, better. 3640 Ere they from Sinai
forth have passed. 3642 _√∞e o√∞er_, the second.


P. 104. l. 3647 This folk has after pleasure gone. 3653 Moses caused it to
cease with his prayer. See note on _blissen_, p. 182. 3658 _for-hirked_ =
_for-irked_, tired. 3661 _Loruerd_ = _louerd_, lord. 3664 Thou shalt cause
me quickly to suffer death. 3676 And brought a great mint of quails; but
_turles_ = _turtles_, doves. See Ayenbite of Inwyt, p. 181.


P. 105. l. 3688 There became Miriam somewhat foolish; _soth_ = _sott_, a
fool (see l. 3685). 3710 A bunch of grapes on a long pole; O.E. _cowele_,
_cowle_, a coop, tub, etc.; Prov. E. _cowl_; _cuuel-staf_ signifies the
staff or pole upon which the people carried their kneading troughs. This
interpretation is supported by the form _cowle-tre_ or _soo-tree_. Falanga,
vectatorium. (Prompt. Parv.) "Phalanga est hasta, vel quidam baculus ad
portandas cupas, Anglice a stang, or a _culstaffe_."‚Äî(Ortus.) "_Courge_, a
stang, pale-staffe, or _cole-staffe_, carried on the shoulder, and notched
for the hanging of a pale at both ends."‚Äî(Cotgrave.) In Caxton's Mirrour of
the World, c. 10, A.D. 1481, it is related that in Ynde "the clusters of
grapes ben so grete and so fulle of muste, that two men ben gretly charged
to bere one of them only upon a _cole-staff_." In Hoole's translation of
the Orbis sensualium, by Comenius, 1658, is given a representation of the
_cole-staff_ (_√¶rumna_), used for bearing a burden between two persons, p.
135; and again, at p. 113, where it appears as used by brewers to carry to
the cellar the new-made beer in "soes," or tubs with two handles (_labra_),
called also _cowls_. In Brand's "Popular Antiquities," ii. 107, will be
found an account of the local custom of riding the _cowl-staff_ or _stang_
(Way in Prompt. Parv.)


P. 106. l. 3721 _swerdes slagen_, slain of (with) sword. 3723 _loder-man_ =
_lodesman_, leader. A leader we will choose (take); _sen_ = _bi-sen_. 3730
If Moses were not opposed there-_to_. 3732 _milche_ = _milce_, mercy, pity.
See l. 3728, where the correct form occurs. 3740 Their righteousness was
pleasing to God. 3742 _sorwes dere_ = sorrow's hurt.

3745-6

  Again (backwards) they made their course,
  As that cloud had taught.


P. 107. l. 3755 _migtful_ qualifies _meistres_ in l. 3756. 3760-61 _ilc
gure_, each of you. Cf. _quilc gure_, which of you, l. 3764. 3761
_reklefat_, incense vat, the vessel holding the incense, censer. See Orm.
i. 2, 35, 58. 3762 _timinge_ seems to be an error for _time ge_, wait ye.
3767 _orgel pride_, arrogant pride. Cf. _orr»ùhellmod_, pride (Orm. i. 216).
"Ichabbe isehen his ouergart, ant his egede _orhel_ ferliche afallet."‚Äî(St.
Marh. p. 11.) I have seen his presumption and his arrogance fearfully
felled. 3770 Instead of the reading in the text substitute the following:
_Moyses, and vt ne wulde gon_; _vr_ seems to be an error for _vt_ = out.
See Numbers xvi. 12. 3774 Held up neither stone nor grit. I do not think
_ston ne gret_ = _strong ne gret_ = strong nor great.

3777-80

  Such destruction they have unexpectedly
  No man need labour to bury them
  This earth is together closed
  As it were never ere broken up.

3786 _fieres swa√∞e_, flame (burning) of fire.


P. 108. l. 3796 There hath a cloud them well girded. 3802 Ran and stood
_between_ the living and the dead; _tiren_ seems, from the way it is
written in the MS., to be an error for _tuen_ = _twen_, between. 3807-14
Though this folk, much frightened, remained quiet for a time, nevertheless
they are yet in diverse counsels (_i. e._ of conflicting opinions).
Moreover, they vacillate in purpose, and think that it may be decided
better. Though these burnt (_i. e._ those destroyed by fire) are refused,
yet they ween that God shall take of the twelve tribes some more to be in
the place of those whom he had despised (rejected). _mi√∞e_ is the pret.
subj. of _mi√∞en_ = A.S. _m√≠√∞an_ (pret. _m√°d_, pl. _midon_; pret. subj.
_mide_), to lie hid, to avoid, omit, hide, dissemble. 3809 _aglen_ =
_aylen_ = _ail_, become weak or foolish. 3814 _for-hugede_, despised,
rejected.

 "Ah Gurmu_n_d hit _for-ho»ùede_
  And habbe he heo nolde."‚Äî(La»ù. iii. 156.)

 "For niss nan mann √æatt uss birr√æ att
  _Forrho»ùhenn_ god to lernenn."‚Äî(Orm. ii. 107.)


P. 109. l. 3824. The name of the tribe which _shall_ thereto belong. 3826
Which tribe he desires this service _to be_ on.

3851-2

  Here and there (yonder) there they buried lie,
  All the old (ones) did there end (i. e. died).


P. 110. l. 3865-6

  God bad assemble the folk and go,
  And before them smite on the stone.

3880 _costful_, dangerous. See Met. Hom. p. xix, where _far-cost_ = a
dangerous voyage. 3884 _wente of liwe_ = turned from life = died. 3887 _in_
= _hin_ = _hine_, him.


P. 111. l. 3924 The sense requires us to read, _for to stillen his vn-e√∞e
mod_, for to quiet his uneasy (disturbed) mind.


P. 112. ll. 3931-2

  In the night a message came to him from God,
  And a prohibition against this king's counsel.

3941 _me goue hold_ = should give me faithfully; _hold_ = _holde_ =
faithfully, truly. 3945 _Oc or or_ = but first ere. 3951 And turned his
heart on worse thought. 3958 And beat and turned it to the path; _sti_,
path, way. "√∞es is for√∞on √∞e√∞e gecuoeden w√¶s √∞erh esaias √∞one witgo
cuoe√∞ende: stefn cliopende in woestern gearuas woeg drihtnes, r√¶hta doe√∞
[wyrcas] _stiga_ his." (Matt. iii. 3. Northumbrian Version.) 3964 _negt_ =
_neg_ + _it_ = nigh it.


P. 113. ll. 3972-3

  It is as true as it is marvellous.
  Said this ass thus with anger.

3976-7

  Had I a sword, I would slay thee.
  So was this man to mischief (grief) brought.

3985-6

  Quoth Balaam, "since I have mis-fared,
  If thou wilt, I will turn back."

3988

  Against my counsel speak thou nought.

3993-4

  Shall I no word be able to forth-do (utter),
  Except what God layeth on me.

4000-1 And went apart; why? but because from above, etc.


P. 114. ll. 4009-10

  His life is blithe (joyful), so shall be his ending (death),
  Who prospereth as this (one) shall prosper.

4015 For _or_ read _and_ (?). 4016 He did it for better success. 4022
_hem_, if not an error for _he_, stands for _he_ + _hem_.


P. 115. l. 4049 "The young women of thy land, fair of sight, and soft of
hand, and bright of hue (complexion), of speech glad (joyous), in haste
shall I set apart _as_ messengers; do thou send out against these men those
who can brew (produce) heart-burning with joy, with features, and with body
and sin, pleasantly, with speech small (flattery), to turn them from God's
fear to thy land gods and our laws; unless thou canst follow this advice
and lead them from God's love, and seek to turn thus their thought, for war
nor weapon helpeth not. 4052 _√∞gere_ = _gere_ = haste. At first I was
inclined to take _√∞gere_ for _dere_, so that _wi√∞ √∞gere_ = for harm. 4053
_ten_ = _te_ (?). Or should we read, _√∞e do ten vt_ = cause those to go
out. 4056 _Luueke_ may be an error for _luue-like_ = pleasantly; or it may
= _luue-leke_ = love; _-lec_ being a not uncommon ending of abstract nouns,
as in O.E. _feirlec_, fairness, beauty. 4063 _quad_. The rhyme seems to
require _quead_; _√∞at ille quad_ = that wickedly spoke (advised); _√∞at ille
quead_ = that wicked wretch.


P. 116. ll. 4086-88

  God bad Moses number
  His folk who were first preserved from death
  Either twenty winters or more old,
  Who in Egypt were not before numbered.

4096 All others were driven in death's web. 4106-8 Leave thou not thy folk
helpless, and do thou, O God, cause them to be governed just as it may be
advantageous for them.


P. 117. l. 4110 _loder-man_. See note on l. 3723.

4119-22

  Whilst to him lasted life-days,
  Them he taught precious laws,
  And written hath committed them to them,
  Unless they them keep, on them shall be sorrow (misfortune shall befall
      them).

In line 4121 the first _hem_ should be omitted.


P. 118. l. 4143-4 Idolatry, that was pleasing to them, oft out-wrought
(effected) for them sorrow's trouble, i. e. brought sorrow and trouble upon
them.

4159-60

  In such virtues grant us to come;
  Through which we shall be to _everlasting_ life taken.

[396] See "The History of Our Lord," vol. i. p. 53.

[397] The Northumbrian version reads _gedroefed_, from which the O.E. vb.
      _drove_.

[398] Written _leasowe_.
