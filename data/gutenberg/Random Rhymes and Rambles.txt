    Sae Iâ€™ve begun to scrawl, but whether
    In rhyme or prose, or baith thegither,
    Or some hotch-potch thatâ€™s rightly neither,
             Let time mak proof;
    But shall I scribble down some blether
             Just clean aff-loof.

    I am nae poet, in a sense,
    But just a rhymer, like, by chance,
    And hae to learning nae pretence.
             Yet, what the matter?
    Wheneâ€™er my muse does on me glance,
             I jingle at her.

INTRODUCTION.


_The RANDOM RHYMES and RAMBLES_, _in verse and prose_, _are but the
leisure musings of the uneducated_, _and cannot be expected to come up to
anything like the standard of even poetry_; _yet_, _when the fact is
known that the Author_, _like his Works_, _are rough and ready_, _without
the slightest notion of either Parnassus or the Nines_, _at least give
him credit for what they are worth_.

   Come nivver dee e thy shell, oud lad,

   Tho thay may chear some stricken heart,
      Or raise some wretched head;
   For thay are words I love mysel,

      An climbing up the hill.

The Fugitive: a Tale Kersmas Time.


   We wor snugly set araand the hob,
      â€™Twor one wet Kersmas Eve,
   Me an arr Kate an tâ€™ family,
      All happy aw believe:
   Aar Kate hed Harry on her knee,
      Anâ€™ awd aar little Ann,
   When their come rapping at the door
      A poor oud beggar man.

   Sleet trinkled down his hoary locks,
      That once no daht were fair;
   His hollow cheeks were deadâ€™ly pale,
      His neck and breast were bare;
   His clooase, unworthy oâ€™ ther name,
      Were raggd an steepin wet;
   His poor oud legs were stockingless,
      And badly shooed his feet.

   Come in toâ€™t haase, said tâ€™ wife to him,
      An get thee up toâ€™t fire;
   Sho then brought aht were humble fare,
      Tâ€™wor what he did desire;
   And when heâ€™d getten what he thowt,
      An his oud regs were dry,
   We akst what distance he hed come,
      An thus he did reply:

   â€œAwm a native of Cheviot hills,
      Some weary miles fra here;
   Where I like you this neet hev seen
      Mony a Kersmas cheer;
   Bud I left my fatherâ€™s haase, when young,
      Determined aw wad roaam;
   Anâ€™ like the prodigal of yore,
      Am mackin toards mi hoame.

   â€œAw soldiered in the Punjaub lines,
      On Indiaâ€™s burning sand;
   An nearly thirty years ago
      Aw left me native land;
   Discipline being ta hard for me,
      My mind wor always bent;
   So in an evil hoar aw did
      Desart me regiment.

   An nivver sin durst aw go see
      My native hill an glen,
   Whar aw mud now as well hev been
      The happiest ov all men;
   Bud me blessingâ€”an aw wish yah all
      A merry Kersmas day;
   Fer me, awl tack me poor oud bones,
      On Cheviot hills to lay.â€

   â€œAw cannot say,â€ aw said toâ€™t wife,
      â€œBud aw feel rather hurt;
   What thinks ta lass if tha lukes aht,
      An finds tâ€™oud chap a shirt.â€
   Sho did an all, and stockins too;
      An tears stud in her eâ€™e;
   An in her face the stranger saw
      Real Yorkshire sympathee.

   Ahr little Jim gav monny a sigh,
      When he hed heard his tale,
   An spak oâ€™ some oud trouses,
      At hung at chamer rail;
   Then aht at door ahr Harry runs,
      An back agean he shogs,
   Heâ€™s been it coit ta fetch a pair
      Oâ€™ my oud iron clogs.

   It must be feearful coud ta neet,
      Fer fouk ats aht at door;
   Give him yahr oud grey coit anâ€™ all,
      Atâ€™s thrown at chamer floor:
   And then thars thy oud hat, said Kate,
      Atâ€™s paused so up an dahn;
   It will be better ner his own,
      Thoâ€™ its withaht a craan.â€

   So when weâ€™d geen him what we cud,
      (In fact afford to give,)
   We saw the tears come dahn the cheeks,
      Oâ€™t poor oud fugitive;
   He thankâ€™d us ower an ower agean
      And often he did pray,
   At barns mud nivver be like him;
      Then travelled on his way.




Sall at Bog.


   Me love is like the pashan dock,
      That grows it summer fog;
   And thoâ€™ shoâ€™s but a country lass,
      I like my Sall at Bog.

   I walkâ€™d her aht up Rivock End,
      And dahn a bonny dale,
   Whear golden balls an kahslips grow,
      An butter cups do smell.

   We sat us dahn at top oâ€™t grass,
      Cloyce to a runnin brook,
   An harkend watter wegtails sing
      Wiâ€™t sparrow, thrush, anâ€™ rook.

   Aw lockt her in my arms, an thout
      Az tâ€™sun shane in her een,
   Sho wor the nicest kolleflaar
      At ivver aw hed seen.

   â€™Twor here we tellâ€™d wer tales oâ€™ love,
      Beneath tâ€™oud hazel tree;
   How fondly aw liked Sall at Bog,
      How dearly sho liked me.

   Anâ€™ if ivver aw deceive thee, Sall,
      Aw vow be all aw see,
   Aw wish that aw mud be a kah,
      An it belong ta thee.

   Bud aw hev plump fergotten nah
      What awther on us said;
   At onny rate we parted friends,
      An boath went home ta bed.




Thâ€™ Furst Pair oâ€™ Briches.


   Aw remember the days oâ€™ me bell-button jacket,
      Wi its little lappels hanging down ower mi waist,
   And my grand bellosed cap,â€”noan nicer Iâ€™ll back it,â€”
      Fer her at hed bowt it wor noan without taste;
   Fer sho wor mi mother anâ€™ I wor her darling,
      An offen sho vowed it, and stroked dahn mi hair,
   An sho tuke me to see her relations e Harden,
      It furst Pair oâ€™ Briches it ivver aw ware.

   Aw remember the time when Aunt Betty anâ€™ Alice
      Send fer me up to lewk at mi cloas,
   An aw wauked up as prahd as a Frenchman fra Calais,
      Wiâ€™ me tassel at side, e mi jacket a rose.
   Aw sooin saw mi uncles, both Johnny anâ€™ Willy,
      Thay both gav me pennys an off aw did steer:
   But aw heeard um say this, â€œHeâ€™s a fine lad is Billy,
      It furst Pair oâ€™ Briches at ivver he ware.â€

   Aw remember the time are Robin anâ€™ Johnny
      Wor keeping ther hens anâ€™ ducks e the yard,
   There wor gamecocks and bantams, wiâ€™ toppins so bonny
      An noan on um mine, aw thowt it wor hard.
   But aw saved up mi pennies aw gat fer mail pickinâ€™
      An sooin gat a shilling by saving it fair,
   Aw then became maister at least oâ€™ wun chicken,
      It furst Pair oâ€™ Briches at ivver aw ware.

   Aw remember wun Sabbath, an tâ€™ sun it wor shining,
      Aw went wi mi father ta Hainworth, to sing
   An tâ€™ stage wor hung raand wi green cotton lining;
      And childer e white made tâ€™ village ta ring.
   We went ta auld Mecheckâ€™s that day to wor drinking,
      Thoâ€™ poor, ther wor plenty, anâ€™ summat ta spare;
   Says Mecheck, â€œThat lad, Jim, is just thee, awâ€™m thinking,
      It furst Pair oâ€™ Briches at ivver tha ware.â€

   Now them wor the days oâ€™ grim boggards and witches,
      When Will-oâ€™-the-wisp cud be seen in the swamp,
   But nah is the days oâ€™ cheating fer riches,
      And a poor honist man is classed wi a scamp.
   Yes, them wor the days at mi mind worrant weary;
      O them wor the days aw knew no despair;
   O give me the time oâ€™ the boggard and fairy,
      Wiâ€™t furst Pair oâ€™ Briches at ivver aw ware.

   And them wor the days aw sal allus remember,
      Sud aw just as oud as Methuslah last;
   Them wor mi March days, but nah its September:
      Neâ€™er to return againâ€”them days are past.
   But a time aw remember aboon onny other,
      Aw kneeled oâ€™ mi knees an sed the Lordâ€™s Prayer;
   Aw sed God bless me father, an God bless mi mother,
      It furst Pair oâ€™ Briches at ivver aw ware.

O, Welcome, Lovely Summer.


   O! welcome, lovely summer,
      With thi golden days so long,
   When the throstle and the blackbird
      Charm us with their song;
   When the lark in early morning
      Taks his aireal flight;
   Anâ€™ the humming bat, anâ€™ buzzard,
      Frolic in the night.

   O! welcome, lovely summer,
      With her rainbowâ€™s lovely form;
   Her thunder anâ€™ her leetnin,
      Anâ€™ her grandeur in the storm:
   With her sunshine and her shower,
      And her wurlin of the dust;
   An the maiden with her flagon,
      To slack the mowerâ€™s thirst.

   O! welcome, lovely summer,
      When the woods wi music ring,
   And the bees so hevvy laden,
      To their hives their treasures bring:
   When we seek some shady bower,
      Or some lovely little dell,
   Or bivock in the sunshine,
      Besides some cooling well.

   O! welcome, lovely summer,
      With her roses in full bloom;
   When the cowslaps anâ€™ the lalack
      Deck the cottage home;
   When the cherry anâ€™ the berry,
      Gives a grandeur to the charm;
   And the clover and the haycock
      Scent the little farm.

   O! welcome, lovely summer,
      With the partridge on the wing;
   When tewit an the moorgame,
      Up fra the heather spring,
   From the crowber an the billber,
      An the bracken an the ween;
   As from the noisey tadpole,
      We hear the crackin din.
               O! welcome, lovely summer.




Burnsâ€™s 113th Birthday.


   Go bring that tuther whisky in,
      An put no watter to it;
   Fer I mun drink a bumper off,
      To Scotlandâ€™s darling poet.

   Its a hunderd year an thirteen nah,
      This Jenewary morn,
   Sin in a lowly cot iâ€™ Kyle,
      A rustic bard wor born.

   He kettled up his moorland harp,
      To ivvâ€™ry rustic scene;
   An sung the ways oâ€™ honest men,
      His Davey and his Jean.

   Their wor nivver a bonny flaar that grew,
      Bud what he could admire;
   Their wor nivver lovely hill or dale,
      That suited not his lyre.

   At last ould Coilia sade enuff,
      My bardy tha did sing,
   Then gently tuke his moorland harp,
      And brack it ivvery string.

   Anâ€™ bindinâ€™ up the holly wreath,
      We all its berries red,
   Sho placed it on his noble brow,
      An pensively sho said:â€”

   â€œSo long as Willies bru ther malt,
      An Robs an Allans spree;
   Mi Burnsâ€™s songs an Burnsâ€™s name,
      Rememberâ€™d thay shall be.




Waiting for tâ€™ Angels.


   Ligging here deead, me poor Ann Lavina,
   Ligging alone me own darling child,
   Just thee white hands crossed on thee bosom,
   We features so tranquil, so calm, and so mild.

   Ligging here deead, so white anâ€™ so bonny,
   Hidding them eyes that oft gazed on mine;
   Asking for sommat withaht ever speaking,
   Asking thee father to say tha wor fine.

   Ligging here deead, the child that so loved me,
   At fane wod haâ€™ hidden me faults if sho could,
   Wal thi wretch of a father dispairing stands ower thee,
   While remorse and frenzy is freezing his blood.

   Ligging here deead, e thee shroud an thee coffin,
   Ligging alone in this poor wretched room,
   Just thee white hands crossed ower thee bosom,
   Waiting for tâ€™angels to carry thee home.




Spring.


   There is hope in the time that is coming,
      When the lambs will frolic on the plain,
   Whilst the bees oâ€™er the heather are humming,
      Then the songsters will cheer us again.
   For the pretty little birds from the edges,
      The reeds for their nest will have riven;
   While the lark from his covert he is soaring,
   His musical notes to the heaven.

   Then weâ€™ll go to the banks of the river,
      Through meadows thatâ€™s blooming in green,
   Where the swallow â€™neath the branches will quivâ€™r
      Oâ€™er the fish as they sport in the stream:
   Then the farmer will be patiently awaiting,
      For the fruits of that labour he has striven,
   While the lark from his covert he is soaring,
   His musical notes to the heaven.

   Then the rays of the sunbeam weâ€™ll cherish,
      The rose thatâ€™s unseen in the bud,
   And the foxglove and hyacinth will flourish,
      Round the ferns in the depths of the wood:
   Then weâ€™ll pluck up the primrose and daisy,
      And the sweets that nature she has given,
   While the lark from his covert he is soaring,
   His musical notes to the heaven.

   Then the merry little boys they will ramble,
      So gleesome, oâ€™er mountain and dale,
   Where the sweets of the rose through the bramble
      Will be blown by the mild summer gale:
   Then a share of Natureâ€™s smiles each morning
      To the poor humble peasant will be given.
   While the lark from his covert he is soaring,
      His musical notes to the heaven.




Haworth Sharpness.


   Says a wag to a porter e Haworth one day,
   â€œYahr not ower sharp are ye drones oâ€™ tâ€™railway,
   For fra Keighley to Haworth Iâ€™ve been oft enough,
   But nivver a hawpenny Iâ€™ve paid yah, begoff.â€

   The porter replied, â€œI very mitch daht it,
   But Iâ€™ll give thee a quart to tell all abaht it;
   For it looks plain to me tha cuddant pass tâ€™ snicket,
   Baht tipping to tâ€™porter thee pass or thee ticket.â€

   â€œThaâ€™l rite up to Derby anâ€™ then thaâ€™l deceive me;â€
   â€œI willnâ€™t, this time,â€ sed tâ€™porter, â€œbelieve me:â€
   â€œThen aht we thy brass, anâ€™ let us be knocking,
   For Iâ€™ve walked it a foot back all rahnd be tâ€™Bocking.â€




The Lass oâ€™ Newsholme Dean.


[Having spent the whole of the afternoon in this romantic little glen,
indulging in pleasant meditations, I began to wend my way down the craggy
pass that leads to the bonny little hamlet of Goose Eye, and turning
round to take a last glance at this enchanting valeâ€”with its running
wimpling streamâ€”I beheld the â€œLass oâ€™ Newsholme Dean.â€  She was engaged
in driving home a Cochin China hen and her chickens.  Instantaneously I
was seized with a poetic fit, and gazing upon her as did Robert Tannyhill
upon his imaginary beauty, â€œThe Flower of Dumblane.â€  I struck my lyre,
and, although the theme of my song turned out afterwards to be a
respectable old woman of 70 winters, yet there is still a charm in my
â€œLass oâ€™ Newsholme Dean.â€]

   Thy kiss is sweet, thy words are kind,
      Thy love is all to me;
   Aw cuddant in a palace find
      A lass more true ner thee.
   Anâ€™ if aw wor the Persian Shah,
      Anâ€™ thee, me Lovely Queen,
   The grandest diamond e me Crown,
      Worâ€™t lass oâ€™ Newsholme Dean.

   The lady gay may heed thee not,
      Anâ€™ passing by may sneer;
   The upstart squireâ€™s dawters laugh,
      When thou, my love, art near.
   But if all ther shining sovrens
      Wor wared oâ€™ sattens green,
   They mightant be as hansum then
      Asâ€™t lass oâ€™ Newsholme Dean.

   When yollow autumnâ€™s lustre shines,
      Anâ€™ hangs her golden ear,
   Anâ€™ natureâ€™s voice fra every bush,
      Is singing sweet and clear.
   â€™Neath some white thorn to song unknown,
      To mortal never seen,
   â€™Tis there with thee I fain would be,
      Me lass oâ€™ Newsholme Dean.

   Od drat, who cares fer kings or queens,
      Mixt in a nationâ€™s broil,
   They never benefit the poor,
      The poor mun allus toil.
   An thou gilded specter royalty,
      That dazzles folkses een,
   Is nowt to me when Iâ€™m we thee,
      Sweet lass oâ€™ Newsholme Dean.

   High from the summit of yon crag,
      I view yon smoky town,
   Where fortune she has deigned to smile
      On monny a simple clown:
   Thoâ€™ free from want, their free from brains;
      Anâ€™ no happier I ween,
   Than this old farmerâ€™s wife anâ€™ hens,
      Aw saw e Newsholme Dean.




The Broken Pitcher.


[The happiest moments of a soldier in time of peace is when sat round the
hearth of his neat little barrack room, along with his comrades, spinning
yarns and telling tales; sometimes giving the history of some famous
battle or engagement in which he took a prominent part, othertimes he
will relate his own love adventures; then the favourite of the room will
oblige them with his song of â€œNelsonâ€ or â€œNapoleon,â€ generally being the
favourite with them;â€”then there is the fancy tale teller which amuses
all.  But in all cases the teller of a tale, yarn or story makes himself
the hero of it, and especially when he speaks of the lass he left behind
him; hence his adventure with the Lassie by the Well.â€]

   Three was a bonny Lassie once
      Sitting by a well;
   But what this bonny lassie thought
      I cannot, cannot tell.
   When by there went a cavalier
      Well-known as Willie Wryght,
   He was in full marching order
      With his armour shining bright.

   â€œAh maiden, lovely maiden, why
      Sits thou by the spring?
   Doest thou seek a lover with
      A golden wedding ring.
   Or wherefore doest thou gaze on me,
      With eyes so bright and wide?
   Or wherefore does that pitcher lay
      Broken by thy side?â€

   â€œMy pitcher is broken, sir,
      And this the reason is,
   A villain came behind, and
      He tried to steal a kiss.
   I could na take his nonsense, so
      Neâ€™er a word I spoke,
   But hit him with my pitcher,
      And thus you see â€™tis broke.â€

   â€œMy uncle Jock McNeil, ye ken
      Now waits for me to come;
   He canna mak his Crowdy,
      Tillâ€™t watter it goes home.
   I canna tak him watter,
      And that I ken full weel,
   Anâ€™ so Iâ€™m sure to catch it,â€”
      For heâ€™ll play the varry deâ€™il.â€

   â€œAh maiden, lovely maiden,
      I pray be ruled by me;
   Smile with thine eyes and ruby lips,
      And give me kisses three.
   And weâ€™ll suppose my helmet is
      A pitcher made oâ€™ steel,
   And weâ€™ll carry home some watter
      To thy uncle Jock McNeil.â€

   She silently consented, for
      She blinkâ€™d her bonny ee,
   I threw my arms around her neck,
      And gave her kisses three.
   To wrong the bonny lassie
      I sware â€™t would be a sin;
   So I knelt down by the watter
      To dip my helmet in.

   Out spake this bonny lassie,
      â€œMy soldier lad, forbear,
   I wodna spoil thee bonny plume
      That decks thy raven hair;
   Come buckle up thy sword again,
      Put on thy cap oâ€™ steel,
   I carena for my pitcher, nor
      My uncle Jock McNeil.â€

   I often think, my comrades,
      About this Northern queen,
   And fancy that I see her smile,
      Though oceans roll between.
   But should you meet her Uncle Jock,
      I hope youâ€™ll never tell
   How I squared the broken Pitcher,
      With the lassie at the well.




The Benks oâ€™ the Aire.


   It issent the star of the evening that breetens,
      Wi fairy-like leetness the old Rivock ends,
   Nor is it the bonny green fields up ta Steeton,
      Or the benks of the river while strolling wi frends,
   That tempts me to wander at twilight so lonely,
      And leave the gay festive for others ta share;
   But O thereâ€™s a charm, and a charm fer me only,
      In a sweet little cot on the benks oâ€™ the Aire.

   How sweet and remote from all turmoil and danger,
      In that cot, wi me Mary, I cud pass the long years:
   In friendship and peace lift the latch to a stranger,
      And chase off the anguish oâ€™ pale sorrowâ€™s tears.
   Weâ€™d wauk aht it morning wen tâ€™yung sun wor shining,
      Wen tâ€™birds hed awakened, and tâ€™lark soarâ€™d the air,
   Anâ€™ Iâ€™d watch its last beam, on me Mary reclining,
      From ahr dear little cot on the benks oâ€™ the Aire.

   Then weâ€™d tauk oâ€™ the past, wen our loves wor forbidden,
      Wen fortune wor adverse, and frends wod deny,
   How ahr hearts wor still true, tho the favors wor hidden,
      Fra the charm of ahr life, the mild stare of ahr eye.
   Anâ€™ wen age shall hev temperâ€™d ahr warm glow oâ€™ feeling
      Ahr loves shud endure, anâ€™ still wod we share
   For weal or in woe, or whativver cums stealing,
      Weâ€™d share in ahr cot on the benks oâ€™ the Aire.

   Then hasten, me Mary, the moments are flying,
      Let us catch the bright fugitives ere they depart;
   For O, thou knaws not wat pleasures supplying,
      Thy bonny soft image has nah geen me heart.
   The miser that wanders besides buried treasure,
      Wi his eyes ever led to the spot in despair;
   How different ta him is my rapture and pleasure
      Near the dear little cot on the benks oâ€™ the Aire.

   But sooin may the day cum, if cum it will ivver;
      The breetest anâ€™ best to me ivver knawn,
   Wen fate may ordain us no longer to sever,
      Then, sweet girl of my heart, I can call thee my own.
   For dear unto me wor one moment beside thee,
      If it wor in the desert, Mary, we were;
   But sweet anâ€™ fairer, whateâ€™er betide thee,
      In ahr sweet little cot on the benks oâ€™ the Aire.




Dear Harden.


   Dear Harden, the home oâ€™ mi boyhood so dear,
   Thy wanderin son sall thee ivver revere;
   Thoâ€™ years hev rolled ower sin thy village I left,
   Anâ€™ oâ€™ frends anâ€™ relations I now am bereft.

   Yet thy hills they are pleasant, thoâ€™ rocky anâ€™ bare;
   Thy dawters are handsom, thy sons they are rare;
   When I wauk throâ€™ thy dells, by the clear running streams,
   I think oâ€™ mi boyhood anâ€™ innocent dreams.

   No care oâ€™ this life then trubled me breast,
   I wor like a young bird new fligged fra its nest;
   Wi me dear little mates did I frolic anâ€™ play,
   Wal lifeâ€™s sweetest moments wor flying away.

   As the dew kissed the daisies ther portals to close,
   At neet e mi bed I did sweetly repose;
   Anâ€™ rose in the morning at natureâ€™s command,
   Till fra boyhood to manhood mi frame did expand.

   The faces that wunce were familiar to me,
   Those that did laugh at my innocent glee;
   I fancy I see them, thoâ€™ now far away,
   Or praps e Bingley church-yard they may lay.

   Fer sin Iâ€™ve embarked on lifeâ€™s stormy seas,
   Mi mindâ€™s like the billows thatâ€™s nivver at ease;
   Yet I still hev a hope mi last moments to crown
   E thee, dearest village, to lay misell down.â€




Castlearâ€™s Address to Spain.


   O weeping Spain, thy banners rear,
      Awake, nor stay in sloth reclining:
   Awake, nor shrink in craven fear,â€”
      See the Carlist blades are shining.
   They come with murdering dirk in hand,
      Death, ruin, rapine in their train:
   To arms! rouse up and clear the land,
      Down with kingcraft, weeping Spain.

   Your sires were great in ancient days,
      No loftier power on earth allowing;
   Shall ye their mighty deeds araise,
      And to these fiends your heads be bowing?
   They strove for fame and liberty
      On fields where blood was shed like rain:
   Hark! theyâ€™re shouting from the sky,
      Down with kingcraft, weeping Spain.

   Castille and Arragon, arise!
      A treacherous Popish war is brewing:
   Tear of the bandage from your eyes,
      Are ye asleep while this is doing?
   They come!  Their prelates lead them on:
      They carry with them thraldomâ€™s chain.
   Up! and crush their cursed Don;
      Down with kingcraft, weeping Spain.
   Go forth, through every well-known spot;
      Oâ€™er field and forest, rock and river:

   Then draw your swords and sheathe them not,
      Until youâ€™ve crushed your foe for ever.
   Do you fear the priestly hosts
      Who march them on with proud disdain;
   _Back_! send home their shrieking ghosts,
      Down with kingcraft, weeping Spain.

   Thou surely art not sunk so low
      That strangers can alone restore thee:
   No; Europe waits the final blow,
      When superstition flies before thee.
   For Spanish might through Spanish hands
      Their freedom only can restrain,
   Then sweep these Carlists from the land,
      Down with kingcraft, weeping Spain.




Christmas Day.


   Sweet lady, â€™tis no troubadour,
      That sings so sweetly at your door,
   To tell you of the joys in store,
            So grand and gay;
   But one that sings remember thâ€™ poor,
            â€™Tis Christmas Day.

   Within some gloomy walls to-day
      Just cheer the looks of hoary gray,
   And try to smooth their rugged way
            With cheerful glow;
   And cheer the widowâ€™s heart, I pray,
            Crushed down with woe.

   O make the weary spent-up glad,
      And cheer the orphan lass and lad;
   Make frailtyâ€™s heart, so long, long sad,
            Your kindness feel;
   And make old crazy-bones stark mad
            To dance a reel.

   Then peace and plenty be your lot,
   And may your deed neâ€™er be forgot,
   That helps the widow in her cot,
            From of your store;
   Nor creed nor seed should matter not,
            The poor are poor.




What Profits Me.


   What profits me thoâ€™ I sud be
      The lord oâ€™ yonder castle gay;
   Hev rooms in state ta imitate
      The princely splendour of the day,
   Fer what are all mi carved doors,
   Mi shandeliers or carpet floors,
      No art cud save me from the grave.

   What profits me thoâ€™ I sud be
      Decked eâ€™ costly costumes grand,
   Like the Persian king oâ€™ kings,
      With diamond rings to deck mi hand:
   Fer what wor all mi grand attire,
   That fooils both envy and admire,
      No gems cud save me from the grave.

   What profits me thoâ€™ I sud be
      Thy worthy host, O millionaire,
   Hev cent. for cent. for money lent;
      My wealth increasing ivvery year.
   For what wor all mi wealth to me,
   Compared ta loisin immortalite,
      Wealth cud not save me from the grave.

   What profits me thoâ€™ I sud be
      Even thee gert Persian Shah,
   Mi subjects stand at mi command,
      Wi fearful aspect and wi awe;
   For what wor a despotic rule,
   Wi all thâ€™ world at my control,
      All cud not save me from the grave.




Ode to Sir Titus Salt.


   Go, string once more old Eborâ€™s harp,
      And bring it here to me,
   For I must sing another song,
      The theme of which shall be,â€”
   A worthy old philantropist,
      Whose soul in goodness soars,
   And one whose name will stand as firm
      As the rocks that gird our shores;
   The fine old Bradford gentleman,
   The good Sir Titus Salt.

   Heedless of others; some there are,
      Who all their days employ
   To raise themselves, no matter how,
      And better men destroy:
   How different is the mind of him,
      Whose deeds themselves are told,
   Who values worth more nobler far
      Than all the heaps of gold,

   His feast and revels are not such,
      As those we hear and see,
   No princely splendour does he indulge,
      Nor feats of revelry;
   But in the orphan schools they are,
      Or in the cot with her,
   The widow and the orphan of
      The shipwrecked mariner.

   When stricken down with age and care,
      His good old neighbours grieved,
   Or loss of family or mate,
      Or all on earth bereaved;
   Go see them in their houses,
      When in peace their days may end,
   And learn from them the name of him,
      Who is their aged friend.

   With good and great his worth shall live,
      With high or lowly born;
   His name is on the scroll of fame,
      Sweet as the songs of morn;
   While tyranny and villany is
      Surely stamped with shame;
   A nation gives her patriot
      A never-dying fame.

   No empty titles ever could
      His principles subdue,
   His queen and country too he loved,â€”
      Was loyal and was true:
   He craved no boon from royalty,
      Nor wished their pomp to share,
   For nobler is the soul of him,
      The founder of Saltaire.

   Thus lives this sage philantropist,
      From courtly pomp removed,
   But not secluded from his friends,
      For friendshipâ€™s bond he loves;
   A noble reputation too
      Crowns his later days;
   The young men they admire him,
      And the aged they him praise.

   Long life to thee, Sir Titus,
      The darling of our town;
   Around thy head while living,
      Weâ€™ll weave a laurel crown.
   Thy monument in marble
      May suit the passer by,
   But a monument in all our hearts
      Will never, never die.

   And when thy days are over,
      And we miss thee on our isle,
   Around thy tomb for ever
      May unfading laurels smile:
   There may the sweetest flowers
      Usher in the spring;
   And roses in the gentle gales,
      Their balmy odours fling.

   May summerâ€™s beams shine sweetly,
      Upon thy hallowed clay,
   And yellow autumn oâ€™er thy head,
      Yield a placid ray;
   May winter winds blow slightly,â€”
      The green-grass softly wave,
   And falling snow-drops lightly
      Upon thy honoured grave.

Bonny Lark.


   Sweetest warbler of the wood,
      Rise thy soft bewitching strain,
   And in pleasureâ€™s sprightly mood,
               Soar again.

   With the sunâ€™s returning beam,
      First appearance from the east,
   Dimpling every limpid stream,
               Up from rest.

   Throâ€™ the airy mountains stray,
      Chant thy welcome songs above,
   Full of sport and full of play,
               Songs of love.

   When the evening cloud prevails,
      And the sun gives way for night,
   When the shadows mark the vales,
               Return thy flight.

   Like the cottar or the swain,
      Gentle shepherd, or the herd;
   Best thou till the morn again,
               Bonny bird.

   Like thee, on freedomâ€™s airy wing,
      May the poetâ€™s rapturous spark,
   Hail the first approach of spring.
               Bonny lark.

   Aw think at past, anâ€™ things ta face,
               My mind hiz filled,
   Thâ€™ wild gooise too aw offen chase,
               Anâ€™ cassels bild.

   O centre place oâ€™ rest anâ€™ greefe,
   Disease or deeath, a kind releef,
   Monarks of a time so breef,
               Alternate reign,
   Till deathâ€™s grim reaper cut the sheaf,
               And clears the plain.

   Aw, awm convinced by thee alone,
   This grate important truth ta awn,
   On thee aw furst saw life, â€™tis knawn,
               E mortal birth;
   Till a few fleetin haars flown,
               Then back ta earth.




Home ov Mi Boyish Days.


   Home of my boyish days, how can I call
   Scenes to my memory, that did befall?
   How can my trembling pen find power to tell
   The grief I experienced in bidding farewell?
   Can I forget the days joyously spent,
   That flew on so rapidly, sweet with content?
   Can I then quit thee, whose memoryâ€™s so dear,
   Home of my boyish days, without one tear?

   Can I look back on days thatâ€™s gone by,
   Without one pleasant thought, without one sigh?
   Oh, no! though never more these eyes may dwell
   On thee, old cottage home, I love so well:
   Home of my childhood, wherever I be,
   Thou art the nearest and dearest to me.

   Can I forget the songs sung by my sire,
   Like some prophetic bard tuning the lyre?
   Sweet were the notes that he taught to the young;
   Psalms for the Sabbath on Sabbath were sung;
   And the young minstrels enraptured would come
   To the lone cottage I once called my home.

   Can I forget the dear landscape around,
   Where in my boyish days I could be found,
   Stringing my hazel-bow, roaming the wood,
   Fancying myself to be bold Robin Hood?
   Then would my mother sayâ€”where is he gone?
   Iâ€™m waiting of shuttles that he should have won:
   She in that cottage there knitting her healds,
   While I her young forester was roaming the fields.

   But the shades of the evening gather slowly around,
   The twilight it thickens and darkens the ground,
   Nightâ€™s sombre mantle is spreading the plain.
   And as I turn round to look on thee again,
   To take one fond look, one last fond adieu;
   By nightâ€™s envious hand thou art snatched from my view,
   But O, thereâ€™s no darkness, to me no decay;
   Home of my boyhood, can chase thee away.




Ode ta Spring Sixty-four.


   O welcum, young princess, thou sweetest of dawters,
      Anâ€™ furst bloomin issue oâ€™ king sixty-four,
   Wi thi brah dekked wi gems oâ€™ the purest oâ€™ waters,
      Tha tells us thi sire, stern winter is ower.

   We hail thi approach wi palm-spangled banners;
      The plant anâ€™ the sapling await thy command;
   Anâ€™ natur herseln, to show hur good manners,
      Now spreads hur green mantle all ower the plain.

   Tha appears in the orchard, the gardin, anâ€™ grotto,
      Whare sweet vegetation anon will adorn;
   Tha smiles on the lord no more than the cottar,
      Fer thi meanest oâ€™ subjects tha nivver did scorn.

   O hasten ta labour! ye wise, O be going!
      Theze wurds they are borne on the wing oâ€™ the wind;
   Tha bid us be early e pleuin anâ€™ sowing,
      Fer he oâ€™ neglects thee thaâ€™ll leave um behind.




My Drechen Dear.


   Nightâ€™s sombre mantle is spreading over,
      Ah, woe is me, these long tedious days;
   Why dist thou leave me, my venturous lover?
      Why did thou cross the raging seas?

   Its melancholy here Iâ€™m lying,
      Half broken-hearted, drechen dear;
   Each blast I hear, love, for thee is sighing,
      Each billow roaring a shed tear.

   How can they say that all-perfect nature
      Has nothing done or made in vain?
   When that beneath the roaring water,
      Does hideous rocks and cliffs remain.

   No eyes these rocks or cliffs discover,
      That lurks beneath the raging deep;
   To mark the spot where lies the lover,
      That leaves the maiden to sigh and weep.

   The miser robbâ€™d of his golden pleasure,
      Views tempests great in his wild despair;
   But what is all his loss of treasure,
      To losing thee, my drechen dear?

   O cease, O cease, thou cruel ocean!
      And give my lover a peaceful rest;
   For what thy storming and all thy motion,
      Compared with that within my breast.

   O could I now over the wild waves stooping,
      The floating corpse of thee could spy;
   Just like a lily in autumn drooping,
      Iâ€™d bow my head, kiss thee, and die.




Address tâ€™t First Wesherwuman.


   E sooth sho wor a reeal god-send,
   Toâ€™t human race the greatest frend,
   Anâ€™ lived no daht at tâ€™other end
         Oâ€™ history.
   Hur name is nah, yah may depend,
         A mistery.

   But sprang sho up fra royal blood,
   Or sum poor slave beyond the flud?
   Me blessing on the sooap anâ€™ sud

   Hur name sall renk among the good,

   If nobbut in a rainy dub,

   Or hed a proper weshin tub,

   Awâ€™d give a craan, if awâ€™d to sub,
         To get hur name.

   In this wide wurld awâ€™m let afloat,
   Thâ€™ poor possessor of wun koat;
   Yet linnen clean aw on thee dote,
         Anâ€™ thus assert,
   Thaâ€™rt wurthy oâ€™ grate Shakespereâ€™s note;

   Bards hev sung the fairest fair,
   There rosy cheeks anâ€™ auburn hair,

   But useful wimminâ€™s songs are rair,
         Anâ€™ seldom sung.




In a Pleasant Little Valley.


   In a pleasant little valley near the ancient town of Ayr,
   Where the laddies they are honest, and the lassies they are fair;
   Where Doon in all her splendour ripples sweetly throâ€™ the wood,
   And on its banks not long ago a little cottage stood,
   â€™Twas there in all her splendour, on a January morn,
   Appeared old Coliaâ€™s genius,â€”when Robert Burns was born.

   Her mantle large of greenish hue and robe of tartan shone,
   And round its mystic border seen was Luger, Ayr, and Doon;
   A leaf-clad holly bough was twined so graceful round her brow,
   She was the darling native muse of Scotiaâ€™s Colia:
   So grand old Coliaâ€™s genius on this January morn,
   Appeared in all her splendour when Robert Burns was born.

   She vowed she neâ€™er would leave him till he sung old Scotiaâ€™s plains,
   The daisy, and the milk-white thorn he tuned in lovely strains;
   And sung of yellow autumn, or some lovely banks and braes:
   And make each cottage home resound with his sweet tuneful lays,
   And sing how Coliaâ€™s genius, on a January morn,
   Appeared in all her splendour when Robert Burns was born.

   She could not teach him painting like her Cunningham at home,
   Nor could she teach him sculpturing like Angelo of Rome:
   But she taught him how to wander her lovely hills among,
   And sing her bonny burns and glens in simple rustic song;
   This old Coliaâ€™s genius did that January morn,
   Vow in all her splendour when Robert Burns was born.

   And in the nights of winter when stormy winds do roar,
   And the fierce dashing waves is heard on Ayrâ€™s old craggy shore,
   The young and old encircled are around the cheerful fire,
   Will talk of Rob the Ploughman and tune the Scottish lyre;
   And sing how Coliaâ€™s genius on a January morn,
   Appeared in all her splendour when Robert Burns was born.




Johnny oâ€™ tâ€™ Bog anâ€™ Keighley
Feff-fee Goast:
A Tale oâ€™ Poverty.


    â€œSome books are lies frae end to end,
    And some great lies were never pennâ€™d;
    But this that I am gaun to tell,
    * * * Lately on a night befel.â€â€”BURNS.

                                * * * * *

   â€™Twor twelve oâ€™clock wun winterâ€™s neet,
      Net far fro Kersmas time,
   When I met wi this Feoffee Goast,
      The subject ov my rhyme.

   Iâ€™d been hard up fer mony a week,
      My way I cuddant see,
   Fer trade an commerce wor as bad
      As ivver they cud be.

   Tâ€™poor hand-loom chaps wor running wild,
      An tâ€™combers wor quite sick,
   For weeks they niver poolâ€™d a slip,
      Ner tâ€™weivers wave a pick.

   An I belongâ€™d to tâ€™latter lot,
      An them wor tâ€™war o tâ€™wo,
   Fer Iâ€™d nine pairs o jaws e tâ€™haase,
      An nowt for em ta do.

   Tâ€™owd wife at tâ€™time wor sick e bed,
      An Iâ€™d a shocking coud,
   Wal tâ€™youngest barn we hed at home,
      Wor nobbut three days oud.

   Distracted to my vary heart,
      At sitch a bitter cup,
   An lippening ivvery day at com,
      At summat wod turn up.

   At tâ€™last I started off wun neet,
      To see what I could mak;
   Determinâ€™d Iâ€™d hev summat tâ€™ eit,
      Or else Iâ€™d noan go back.

   Through tâ€™Skantraps an be tâ€™ Bracken Benk,
      I tuke wi all mi meet;
   Be tâ€™Wire Mill an Ingrow Loin,
      Reight into tâ€™oppan street.

   Saint Johnâ€™s Church spire then I saw,
      An I wor rare an fain,
   Fer near it stood tâ€™oud parsonageâ€”
      I cuddant be mistain.

   So up I went to tâ€™Wicket Gate,
      Though sad I am to say it,
   Resolvâ€™d to ax em for some breead,
      Or else some brocken meit.

   Bud just as I wor shacking it,
      A form raise up afore,
   An sed â€œWhat dus ta want, tha knave,
      Shacking tâ€™ Wicket Door?â€

   He gav me then to understand,
      If I hedant cum to pray,
   At tâ€™grace oâ€™ God an tâ€™breead oâ€™ life,
      Wor all they gav away.

   Itâ€™s feaful nice fer folk to talk
      Abaat ther breead oâ€™ life,
   An specially when theyâ€™ve plenty,
      Fer tâ€™childer an ther wife.

   Bud I set off agean at tâ€™run,
      Fer I weel understood,
   If I gat owt fra that there clan,
      It woddant do ma good.

   E travelling on I thowt I heeard,
      As I went nearer tâ€™tahn,
   A thaasand voices e mi ears
      Saying â€œJohn, where are ta bahn?â€

   An ivvery grocerâ€™s shop I passâ€™d,
      A play-card I cud see,
   E tâ€™biggest type at eâ€™er wod printâ€”
      â€œThereâ€™s nowt here, lad, for thee.â€

   Wal ivvery butcherâ€™s shop I passâ€™d,
      Astead oâ€™ meit wor seen,
   A mighty carving-knife hung up,
      Hi, fair afore me een.

   Destruction wor inviting me,
      I saw it fearful clear,
   Fer ivvery druggist window sedâ€”
      â€œReal poison is sold here.â€

   At tâ€™last I gav a frantic howl,
      A shaat oâ€™ dreead despair,
   I seized mesen be tâ€™toppin then,
      An shackâ€™d an luggâ€™d me hair.

   Then quick as leetening ivver wor,
      A thowt com e me heeadâ€”
   Iâ€™d tak a walk to tâ€™Symetry,
      An meditate wi tâ€™deead.

   Tâ€™oud Cherch clock then wor striking tâ€™time
      At folk sud be asleep,
   Save tâ€™Bobbies at wor on ther beat,
      An tâ€™Pindar after tâ€™sheep.

   Wi lengthened pace I hastenâ€™d off
      At summat like a trot;
   To get to tâ€™place I started for,
      Me blooid wor boiling hot.

   Anâ€™ what I saw at Lackock Gate,
      Rearâ€™d up agean a post,
   I cuddant tellâ€”but yet I thowt
      It wor another goast!

   Bud whether it wor goast or not,
      I heddant time to luke,
   Fer I wor taken be surprise,
      When turning tâ€™Sharmanâ€™s Nuke.

   Abaat two hundard yards e tâ€™front,
      As near as I cud think,
   I thowt I heeard a dreadful noise,
      An nah an then a clinck!

   What ivver can these noises be?
      Some robbers, then I thowt!â€”
   Iâ€™d better step aside an see,
      Theyâ€™re happen up to nowt!

   So I gat ower a fence there wor,
      An peeping through a gate,
   Determined Iâ€™d be satisfied,
      If Iâ€™d awhile to wait.

   At tâ€™last two figures com to tâ€™spot
      Where I hed hid mesel,
   Then walkers-heath and brimstone,
      Most horridly did smell.

   Wun on em hed a nine-tailâ€™d cat,
      His face as black as soit,
   His name, I think, wor Nickey Ben,
      He hed a clovven fooit.

   An tâ€™other wor all skin an bone
      His name wor Mr. Deeath;
   Withaat a stitch oâ€™ clothes he wor,
      An seemâ€™d quite aght oâ€™ breeath.

   He hed a scythe, I plainly saw,
      He held it up aloft,
   Just same as he wor bahn to maw
      Oud Jack Keilieâ€™s Croft.

   â€œWhere are ta bahn to neet, grim fiz?â€
      Sed Nickey, wi a grin,
   â€œTha knaws I am full up below,
      An cannot tack more in.â€

   â€œWhat isâ€™t to thee?â€ sed Spinnle Shenks,
      â€œTha ruffin ov a dog,
   Iâ€™m nobbut bahn me rhaands agean,
      To see wun John oâ€™ tâ€™Bog.

   I cannot see it fer me life,
      What itâ€™s to do wi thee;
   Go mind thi awn affairs, oud Nick,
      An nivver thee heed me.â€

   â€œIt is my business, Spinnle Shenks,
      Whativver tha may say,
   For I been roasting tâ€™human race
      For mony a weary day.â€

   Just luke what wark Iâ€™ve hed wi thee,
      This last two years or so;
   Wi Germany an Italy,
      An even Mexico.

   Anâ€™ then tha knaws that Yankey broil
      Browt in some thaasands more;
   An sooin fra Abysinnia,
      Thaâ€™ll bring black Theodore.

   So drop that scythe, oud farren Death,
      Letâ€™s rest a toathree wick;
   Fer what wi tâ€™seet oâ€™ tâ€™fryring-pan,
      Tha knaws Iâ€™m ommost sick.â€

   â€œI sall do nowt o tâ€™sort,â€ says Deeath,
      Who spack it wi a grin,
   â€œIse just do as I like fer thee,
      So tha can hod thi din.â€

   This made oud Nick fair raging mad,
      An lifting up his whip,
   He gav oud Spinnle Shenks a lash
      Across o tâ€™upper lip.

   Then, like a neighing steed, oud Shenks,
      To give oud Nick leg bail,
   He started off towards the tahn,
      An Nick stuck aht his tail.

   Then helter-skelter off they went,
      As ower tâ€™fence I lape;
   I thowtâ€”well, if it matters owt,
      Iâ€™ve made a nice escape.

   But nah the mooin began to shine
      As breet as it cud be;
   An dahn the vale ov tâ€™Aire I lukâ€™d,
      Where I cud plainly see.

   The trees wur deeadly pale wi snaw,
      An tâ€™winding Aire wor still,
   An all wor quite save tâ€™hullats,
      At wor screaming up oâ€™ tâ€™hill.

   Oud Rivvock End an all araand
      Lukâ€™d like some fiendish heead,
   Fer more I stared, an more I thowt
      It did resemble tâ€™deead.

   The Friendly Oaks wor altered nah,
      To what Iâ€™d seen afore;
   An lukâ€™d as though theyâ€™d never be
      Tâ€™oud friendly Oaks no more.

   Fer wun wor like a giant grim,
      His nose com to a point,
   An wi a voice like thunner sedâ€”
      â€œThe times are aaght oâ€™ tâ€™joint!â€

   An tâ€™other like a whipping-post,
      Bud happen not as thin,
   Sed â€œTâ€™times ul alter yet, oud fooil,
      So pray, nah, hod thi din?â€

   I tuke no farther gawm oâ€™ them,
      Bud paddled on me way;
   Fer when I ivver mack a vow,
      I stick to what I say.

   I heddant goan so far agean,
      Afoar I heeard a voice,
   Exclaimingâ€”wi a fearful groanâ€”
      â€œGo mack a hoyle e tâ€™ice!â€

   I turned ma rhaand where tâ€™saand com fro,
      An cautiously I bowed,
   Saying thenk yo, Mr. Magic Voice,
      Iâ€™m flaid oâ€™ gettin coud.

   Bud nah a sudden shack tuke place,
      A sudden change oâ€™ scene;
   Fer miles where all wor white afore,
      Wor nah a bottle-green.

   Then com a woman donned e white,
      A mantle gert she wore;
   A nicer lukin, smarter form,
      I nivver saw afore.

   Her features did resemble wun
      O that kind-hearted lot,
   Atâ€™s ivver ready to relieve
      The poor man in his cot.

   Benevolence wor strongly marked
      Upon her noble heead;
   An on her breast yo might hev read,
      â€œWho dees fer want oâ€™ breead?â€

   In fact, a kinder-hearted soul
      Oud Yorksher cuddant boast;
   An who wod feel the least alarmed,
      To talk to sitch a goast?

   I didant feel at all afraid,
      As nearer me she drew;
   I sedâ€”Good evening, Mrs. Goast,
      Hah ivver do yo dew?

   Sho nivver seemed to tack no gawm,
      Bud pointed up at tâ€™mooin,
   An beckonâ€™d me to follow her
      Dahn be tâ€™Wattery Loin.

   So on we went, an dahn we turned,
      An nawther on us spack;
   Bud nah an then sho twined her heead,
      To see if Iâ€™d runned back.

   At tâ€™last sho stopped an turned her rahnd
      An luked ma fair e tâ€™een;
   â€™Twor nah I picked it aaght at wunce,
      Sho wor no human been.

   Sho rave a paper fra her breast,
      Like some long theatre bill;
   An then sho sed â€œWeak mortal,
      Will ta read to me this will?

   But first, afoar tha starts to read,
      Iâ€™ll tell thee who I iz;
   Tha lukes a deacent chap enuff,
      I judge it by thi phiz.

   Well, Iâ€™ve a job fer thee to do,
      That is, if tha will do it;
   I think thaâ€™rt tâ€™likeliest man I knaw,
      Becos tha art a poet.

   If I am not mistaken, friend,
      I offan hear thi name;
   I think they call thi â€œJohn o tâ€™Bog;â€
      Says Iâ€”â€œOud lass, itâ€™s tâ€™same.â€

   â€œItâ€™s just so mony years this day,
      I knaw it by me birth,
   Sin I departed mortal life,
      An left this wicked earth.

   But ere I closed these een to go
      Into eternity,
   I thowt Iâ€™d do a noble act,
      A deed oâ€™ charity.

   I hed a bit oâ€™ brass, tha knaws,
      Some land anâ€™ property;
   I thowt it might be useful, John,
      To folks e poverty.

   So then I made a will o tâ€™lot,
      Fer that did suit my mind;
   I planned it as I thowt wor tâ€™best,
      To benefit mankind.

   I left a lot to tâ€™Grammar Skooil,
      By reading tâ€™will thaâ€™ll see;
   That ivvery bodyâ€™s barn, tha knaws,
      May hev ther skooling free.

   An if tha be teetotal, John,
      Tha may think it a fault,
   Bud to ivvery woman ligging in
      I gav a peck oâ€™ malt.

   Bud tâ€™biggest bulk oâ€™ brass atâ€™s left,
      As thaâ€™ll hev heeard afore,
   Wor to be dealt hauf-yearly
      Among arr Keighley poor.

   I certainly did mack a flaw,
      Fer which Iâ€™ve rued, alas!
   â€™Twor them at troubled tâ€™parish, John,
      Sud hev no Feoffee Brass.

   An nah, if tha will be so kind,
      Go let mi tâ€™trustees knaw
   At I sall be obleged to them
      To null that little flaw.

   An will ta mention this anall,
      Wal thaâ€™s an intervue?â€”
   Tell em to share tâ€™moast brass to tâ€™poor,
      Whativver else they due.

   Then I sall rest an be at peace,
      Boath here an when e Heavâ€™n;
   Wal them at need it will rejoice
      Fer tâ€™bit oâ€™ brass Iâ€™ve givâ€™n.

   An tell em to remember thee
      Upon tâ€™next Feoffee Day!â€
   I saysâ€”I sallant get a meg,
      Iâ€™m getting parish pay.

   So when shoâ€™d spocken what sho thowt,
      An tellâ€™d me what to doo,
   I axâ€™d her if shoâ€™d harken me,
      Wal I just said a word or two.

   Iâ€™ll nut tell yo one word a lie,
      As sure as my nameâ€™s â€˜John;â€™
   I think at yo are quite e tâ€™mist
      Abaht things going on.

   Folks gether in fra far an near,
      When it is Feoffee-Day;
   An think they hev another lowse
      Wi tâ€™little bit oâ€™ pay.

   Asteead oâ€™ geeing tâ€™brass tâ€™ poor,
      Itâ€™s shocking fer to tell,
   Theyâ€™ll hardly let em into tâ€™doorâ€”
      I knaw it be mesel.

   Asteead a being a peck oâ€™ malt
      Fer tâ€™wimmen lying in,
   Itâ€™s geen to rascals ower-grown,
      To drink e rum an gin.

   Then them at isâ€”I understandâ€”
      What yo may call trustees,
   They hev ther favorites, yo knaw,

Charming Rebekka oâ€™ Riddlesden Hall.


   On Aireâ€™s bonny benks wiâ€™ hur meadows so green,
   Thareâ€™s an anshent oud hall to-day may be seen,
   That wor built in the days of some oud fudal king,
   Of whom the oud bards delited to sing.
   Thoâ€™ faded in splender, its grateness wos then,
   Knawn to its foemen as Red Lionâ€™s den;
   â€™Neath its armorial sheeld, anâ€™ hoary oud wall,
   I now see Rebekka oâ€™ Riddlesden Hall.

   Hur majestik black eye does tru buty display,
   Resemblin truly the goddess of day;
   Her dark-flowing ringlets, yahâ€™d think as they shone,
   That Venus â€™ud fashunâ€™d â€™em after hur awn.
   Fer hur tresses no ribbins ner trappins do bind,
   But wantonly luxurious flows in the wind:
   It â€™ud a pleased the grate Reubens or Raffell to call,
   To see sweet Rebekka oâ€™ Riddlesden Hall.

   Like the tall mountain fir, she as stedy, I trow,
   When zephyr-like winds does sighingly blow;
   The grove or the grotto when mild breezes move,
   Are gentle Rebekkaâ€™s sweet gales ov luve.
   Her breeath, wheer tru wit so grasefully flows,
   Has the beutiful scent of the pink and the rose;
   Thereâ€™s no nymph from the East to Niagra Fall,
   To ekwall Rebekka oâ€™ Riddlesden Hall.

   Her toe points the graand wi sich beuty anâ€™ grace,
   Nor varies a hairâ€™s-bredth, shud yah mezzur her pace:
   Anâ€™ wen drest e hur gingham we white spots and blue,
   O then is Rebekka so pleazin to vue.
   Wiâ€™ her gray Wolsey stockins by hersell nit and spun,
   Anâ€™ a nice little apron, hieroglyphic done:
   It needs noa rich velvets or Cashmeer shawl,
   To deck out Rebekka oâ€™ Riddlesden Hall.

   Luve, grace and beuty attends on her will;
   Sho wounds wiâ€™ a luke, wiâ€™ a frown sho can kill;
   The yuths az they pass her, exclaim, â€œwoe is me!â€
   Who sees her must luve her, who luves her must dee.
   At church on a Sabbath, oud men raise thare arms
   Anâ€™ cry, â€œO! grate hevens! were ever sich charms?â€
   Wile matrons anâ€™ maidens Godâ€™s blessing they call,
   On the head of Rebecca oâ€™ Riddlesden Hall.




Shooâ€™s Deead anâ€™ Goan!


   My poor oud lass, anâ€™ are ta goan,
         To thy long rest?
   Anâ€™ mun the cruel cold grave-stone
         Close ower thy breast?
   Anâ€™ are ta goan no more to see,
   Excepting e fond memory;
   Yes empty echo answers meâ€”
         â€œShooâ€™s deead anâ€™ goan!â€

   E vain the wafters oâ€™ the breeze

   E vain the birds upon the trees,

   E vain the early rose-bud blaws,
   E vain wide Nature shows her Cause,
   Deeath thunders fro his greedy jawsâ€”
         â€œShooâ€™s deead anâ€™ goan!â€

   Thereâ€™s more ner me thatâ€™s sore bereft,
         I pity wun,
   Anâ€™ thatâ€™s my ladâ€”heâ€™s sadly leftâ€”
         My little John;

         At tâ€™least weâ€™ll try;
   Thi mutherâ€™s safe wi Him â€™at hears
         The orphanâ€™s sigh;
   Fer â€™tis the lot oâ€™ tâ€™human mackâ€”
   Anâ€™ who can tell which next heâ€™ll tack?
   Anâ€™ crying cannot bring her back;
         Shooâ€™s deead anâ€™ goan!




The Heroic Watchman of Calversike Hill.


[This extraordinary â€œheroâ€ either bore false witness against his
neighbour, a poor artisan, or (taking his own word for it) saved the
nation from great disaster and ruin by putting out a fire that no one saw
but himself.]

   Weâ€™ve heard of great fires in city and town,
   And many disasters by fire are known;
   But surely this fire which Iâ€™m going to tell,
   Was worse than Mount Ã†tna, Vesuvius or hell;
   For the great prophesy it no doubt would fulfill,
   But for _heroic_ watchman at Calversike Hill.

   This fire it broke out in the night it was said,
   While peacefully each villager slept in his bed;
   And so greatly the flames did illumne all the skies,
   That it took the big watchman all in surprise.
   Yet great was the courage and undaunted skill
   Of the _heroic_ watchman of Calversike Hill.

   He swore by his Maker, the flames rose so high,
   That within a few yards, sir, it reached to the sky;
   And so greatly it lighted up mountains and dales,
   He could see into Ireland, Scotland and Wales!
   And so easily the commons did swallow his pill,
   That they finâ€™d the poor artist of Calversike Hill.

   Now, thereâ€™s some foolish people are led to suppose,
   It was by some shavings this fire first arose;
   But yet, says our â€œhero,â€ I greatly suspect,
   This fire was caused by the grossest neglect.
   But Iâ€™m glad itâ€™s put out, let it be as it will,
   Says the _heroic_ watchman of Calversike Hill.

   He needed no witness to swear what he had done,
   Yet if he had wanted he could have had one;
   For one Tommy Twister, that never was there,
   Saw the sparks from the chimney, as they flew in the air,
   The greatest sized coal pot no doubt they would fill,
   Like the head of the _hero_ of Calversike Hill.

   So many brave thanks to this _heroic_ knave,
   For thousands of lives no doubt he did save,
   And but for this hero disaster had spread,
   And smothered the nation while sleeping in bed;
   But to save all his people it was the Lordâ€™s will,
   Through the _heroic_ watchman at Calversike Hill.

   So mind and be careful and put out your lights,
   All ye with red noses in case they ignite,
   Or perhaps from your bed you may have to leap,
   In case this great watchman chances to sleep.
   For as rumours are spread, he is fond of his gill,
   Is the _heroic_ watchman of Calversike Hill.




Betty Blake: A Tale of Butterworth Panic.


   It wor e black twenty-six when I wor reight in a fix,
      Anâ€™ trade it wor bad anâ€™ are poor hearts wor sad,
   Anâ€™ weâ€™d nout else to due bud to starve or to flee,

   Aw wor freating anâ€™ thinking what wod be the end,
      Baht meil or potatoes, or money or friendâ€”
   When my wife staggerâ€™d in at are poor cottage door,
      Gav a stare raand the house anâ€™ fell on the floor,
   We a cry at made me both tremble anâ€™ shake;â€”
      Sho wor more like a Specktor ner poor Betty Blake.

   It spite ov her troubles, aw lifted her up
   To are poor wretched bed, anâ€™ gav her a sup
   O coud watterâ€”anâ€™ thinking, it happen mud ease herâ€”
   Anâ€™ tryâ€™d my indevors to mend her anâ€™ please her;
   For aw talked oâ€™ that day that aw used to coart her,
   Bud little thowt then at aw couldnâ€™t support her;
   Or that panic wod come like a dark thunner claad,
   Anâ€™ scatter the homes oâ€™ the poor anâ€™ the praad:
   Bud my heart burned we grief, fer aw wanted to save her,
   Fer aw knew at my Betty wor mad in the faver.

   Aw sat by her side fer two neets anâ€™ two days,
   Anâ€™ aw thowt sho might mend, as on her aw gazed;
   Sho catched hod oâ€™ my hand, anâ€™ her senses returned,
   Bud net her gooid health, fer her fingers still burned,â€”
   â€œAwn going,â€ sho saidâ€”â€œwhere no hunger or pain
   Al be we us, Johny, when we meet again.
   The angels have whispered my spirit to free,
   We voices as soft as the hum of the bee;
   It wor pining at did it, done fer thy sake,
   In heaven youâ€™ll meet we your poor Betty Blake.â€

   We a groan anâ€™ a rattle sho dropt her poor heead,
   Aw could hardly believe at my Betty wor deead;
   Anâ€™ aw felt at her side, fer aw wanted to save her,
   Anâ€™ like her at wor goanâ€”aw wor mad we the faver.
   Bud they tuke her away the varry next day,
      To a little church yard, anâ€™ it seemed fearful hard,
         At aw couldnâ€™t follow my wife
         At aw loved as my life.
   Bud awâ€™ve put up a tombstone oâ€™ peeats fer her sake,
      An aw markâ€™d on it letters at means Betty Blake.




The Vision.


   Blest vision of departed worth,
      I see thee still, I see thee still;
   Thou art the shade of her thatâ€™s goan,
      My Mary Hill, my Mary Hill.

   My chaamer in this silent hour,
      Were dark anâ€™ drear, were dark anâ€™ drear;
   But brighter far than Cynthiaâ€™s beam,
      Now thou art here, now thou art here.

   Wild nature in her grandeur had
      No charm for me, no charm for me;
   Did not the songsters chant thy name
      Fra ivvery tree, fra ivvery tree.

   Chaos wod hev com agean,
      E worlds afar, e worlds afar;
   Could aw not see my Maryâ€™s face,
      In ivvery star, in ivvery star;

   Say when the messenger oâ€™ death,
      Sal bid ma come, sal bid ma come;
   Wilt thou be foremost in the van,
      To tack ma hoam, to tack ma hoam.




A New Devorse.

      Anâ€™ stand it I am forst;

   Then answerâ€™d Rodge, I hev a dodge,
      Az gooid a plan az onny;
   A real devorse thaâ€™ll get of courseâ€”
      It willant cost a penny.

      Then tell me what it iz, says Pug,

   Weâ€™ll go ta Keethlah Warkhaase, lad,

Gooise anâ€™ Giblet Pie.


   A Kersmass song Iâ€™ll sing, me lads,
      If yohâ€™ll bud hearken me;
   An incident e Kersmass time,
      E eighteen sixty-three:
   Withaht a stypher e the worldâ€”
      Iâ€™d scorn to tell a lieâ€”
   I dined wi a gentleman
      Oâ€™ Gooise anâ€™ giblet pie.

   Iâ€™ve been e lots oâ€™ feeds, me lads,
      An hed some rare tuck-aahts;
   Blooid-pudding days wi killing pigs,
      Minch pies anâ€™ thumping taahts;
   But I wirâ€™d in an reight anall,
      Anâ€™ suppâ€™d when I wor dry,
   Fer I wor dining wi a gentleman
      Oâ€™ gooise anâ€™ giblet pie.

   I hardly knew what ailâ€™d me, lads,
      I felt so fearful praad;
   Me ears prickâ€™d up, me collar raise,
      Taards a hauf-a-yard;
   Me chest stood aaht, me charley in,
      Like horns stuck aaht me tie;
   Fer I dined wi a gentleman
      Oâ€™ gooise anâ€™ giblet pie.

   I offan think oâ€™ tâ€™feed, me lads,
      When tâ€™ gentleman I meet;
   Bud nauther on us speiks a word
      Abaht that glorious neet;
   In fact, I hardly can mesel,
      I feel so fearful shy;
   Fer I ate a deal oâ€™ tâ€™roasted gooise,
      And warmed his giblet pie.




Ode to Wedlock!


   Oh! Hymen, god of Wedlock! thou
   Companion of the loverâ€™s vow,
      Thy subjects they are fearful;
   If thou could nobbut see the strife,
   There is sometimes â€™tween man and wife,
      I think thouâ€™d be more careful.

   Oft has thou bound in durance vile,
   De fearful frown, and cheerful smile,
      And doubtless thought it famous;
   When thou the mind ov fancy sweet,
   Has knit the knot so nice and neat
      For some blessed ignoramous.

   What nature, truth, and reason too,
   Has oft declared would never do,
      Thouâ€™rt fool enough to do it;
   Thouâ€™s bound for better and for worse,
   Lifeâ€™s greatest blessing with a curse,
      And both were made to rue it.

   But luve is blind, and oft deceived,
   If adage old can be believed,
      And suffers much abuses;
   Or never could such matches be,
   O, mighty Hymen! tied by thee,
      So thou has thy excuses.

Song of the Months, from
January to December.


   High oâ€™er the hill-tops moans the wild breezes,
      As from the dark branches I hear the sad strain:
   See the lean pauper by his grim hearth he freezes,
      While comfort and plenty in palaces reign.

   Dark is the visage of the rugged old ocean,
      To the caves in the billow he rides his foamed steed:
   As over the grim surges with his chariot in motion,
      He spreads desolation, and laughs at the deed.

   No more with the tempest the river is swelling,
      No angry clouds frown, nor sky darkly lower;
   The bee sounds her horn, and the gay news is telling
      That spring is established with sunshine and showers.

   In the pride of its beauty the young year is shining,
      And nature with blossom is wreathing the trees;
   The white and the green in rich clusters entwining,
      And sprinkling their sweetness on the wings of the breeze.

   O May, lovely goddess! what name can be grander?
      What sunbeam so bright as thine own smiling eye;
   With thy mantle of green, richly spangled in splendour,
      At whose sight the last demon of winter does fly.

   From her home in the grass see the primrose is peeping,
      While diamond dew-drops around her is spread;
   She smiles throâ€™ her tears like an infant thatâ€™s sleeping,
      And to laughter is changed as her sorrows are fled.

   The landscape around is now sprinkled with flowers,
      The mountains are blue in their distant array;
   The wreaths of green leaves are refreshed with the showers,
      Like a moth in the sunshine the lark flees away.

   How joyous the reapers, their harvest songs singing
      As they see the maid bringing the flagon and horn;
   And the goddess of plenty benedictions is flinging
      Over meadows and pastures, and her barley and corn.

   â€™Tis sweet on the hills with the morning sun shining,
      To watch the rich vale as it brightens below;
   â€™Tis sweet in the valley when day is declining,
      To mark the fair mountains, deep tinged with its glow.

   Now is the time when biting old Boreas
      True to his calling,â€”the tempests impend;
   His hailstones in fury is pelting before us,
      Our fingers are smarting, and heads they are bent.

   The cold winds do murmur, the bleak snow is falling,
      The beasts of the forest from hunger doth call;
   There is desolate evenings and comfortless mornings,
      And gloomy noontides for one and for all.

   Drear is thine aspect, tyrannical December,
      O hast thou no mercy for the pitiless poor;
   Christmas is thine, and we shall remember,
      Though dark is thy visage, we honour thee more.




My Visit taâ€™t Glory Band.


   Last Sunday, reight early, I sett off fra home,
   Ower mountains anâ€™ valleys, intending to roam;
   As it wor a fine morning anâ€™ no sign oâ€™ rain,
   I bethowt ma Iâ€™d go up Oakworth be tâ€™train;
   But Iâ€™m sitch a whimsical sort of a man,
   I nivver get threw wi owt at I plan.

   For Iâ€™d hardly goan two hundred yards fra my door,
   When who did I see walking prattly before?
   It wor oud Jennet tâ€™Ranter fra Avercake row,
   As nice a oud body is ivver you saw;
   Shoo wor dressâ€™d up ta tâ€™mark wi her Cashmere shawl,
   An wor bahn dahn to tâ€™meeting at Temperance Hall.

   When I saw it wor Jennet I lengthenâ€™d my pace,
   Anâ€™ as soon as shoa saw me shoo lookâ€™d iâ€™ my face;
   Anâ€™ says â€œHallo, Bill! thaâ€™s comâ€™d aght fearful soin
   Therâ€™ll be a blue snaw;â€”pray, where are ta gooin?
   If thaâ€™s nobbut come aht for a bit of a stroll,
   Thaâ€™d better go wi ma for tâ€™gooid oâ€™ thy soul.â€

   So I agreed to go wi her; for what could I do,
   When tâ€™decent oud woman wor teasing ma so?
   So we linkâ€™d on together anâ€™ paddled along,
   Both on us singing a Glory Band song;
   Hasomivver we landed, anâ€™ hednâ€™t ta wait,
   For one tâ€™panjandrums hed getten agait.

   So they prayed anâ€™ they sang iâ€™ ther oud fashunâ€™d way;
   Until a gert chap says â€œIâ€™ve summat ta say;â€
   Anâ€™ bethart Iâ€™st a fallen dahn sick iâ€™ my pew,
   But I thowt at toan hauf tâ€™ he said worant true,
   For he charged Parson Ball wiâ€™ being drunk iâ€™ the street,
   At heâ€™d been put ta bed three times iâ€™ one neet.

   â€œDoes ta hear,â€ says Oud Jennet, â€œwhat tâ€™hullet is saying,
   Heâ€™s using his scandal asteead oâ€™ being praying,
   For John Ball is respected by ivvery one,
   So I sallant believe a word about John,
   Fer him anâ€™ arr Robin are two decent men,
   So pray yah nah harken, theyâ€™ll speik fer thersen.â€

   So all wor nah silent, they mud hear a pin fall,
   For nobody wor hissing or clapping at all;
   For scarce had long Gomersall spun out his yarn,
   Wi his two blazing een he hed scarcely sat dahn,
   Than John stood up on his pins in a minit,â€”
   Anâ€™ rare anâ€™ weel please wor me and Oud Jennet.

   â€œMy brethren,â€ he sed wi a tear in his ee,
   â€œYah sall hear for yerselns my accusers anâ€™ me,
   Anâ€™ if I be guiltyâ€”manâ€™s liable to fall
   As well as yer pastor anâ€™ servant John Ball;
   But let my accuser, if faults he hes noan,
   Beâ€™t tâ€™first, and no other to thraw the first stone.

   â€œIâ€™ve drunk wine and porter, I do not deny,
   But then my accusers hev not telled you why:
   So their false accusation I feel it more keen,
   â€™Cos Iâ€™ve hed the lumbago iâ€™ both oâ€™ my een;
   Beside mi back warked as if it wor broke,
   Anâ€™ mi throitâ€™s been so parched wal I thowt I sud choke.

   â€œIâ€™ve been so distracted and hanneled so bad,
   Wal I thowt monny a time I sud ommust go mad,
   Anâ€™ tâ€™doctors hes tellâ€™d me there wor no other way
   Nobbut going to Blackpool or else Morecambe Bay;
   Anâ€™ charged me to mind if I sat dahn to dine,
   To lig into tâ€™porter, anâ€™t brandy, anâ€™t wine.

   â€œSo nah, my accusers, what hev you to say,
   You can reckon that up in your awn simple way;
   But if thereâ€™s a falsehood in what Iâ€™ve sed nah
   I wish mi new hat wod turn into a kah,
   So this is mi answer, anâ€™ this mi defence.â€
   â€œWell done!â€ says oud Jennet, â€œheâ€™s spokken some sense.â€

   So his speech nah he ended, but it touchâ€™d em it wick,
   For we all could see plainly it wor nowt but a trick;
   And Jennet declaredâ€”thoâ€™ she might be too rude,â€”
   If heâ€™d come up toâ€™t dinner heâ€™s hev some home brewâ€™d,
   Fer it spite oâ€™ ther scandal sho wor proud on him yet,
   Anâ€™ if he drank wine anâ€™ porter whoâ€™d out to du wiâ€™t.




Tâ€™ History oâ€™t Haworth Railway.


Before I commence mi short history oâ€™t Haworth Railway, it might be as
weel to say a word or two abaht Haworth itseln.  Itâ€™s a city atâ€™s little
knawn, if onny, it history oâ€™ England, though therâ€™s no daht but its as
oud as Methuslam, if not ouder, yet with it being built so far aht at
latitude ov civilized nashuns, nobodyâ€™s scarcely knawn owt abaht it wal
latly.  Tâ€™ finders ov it are sed to be people fraâ€™t Eastern countries,
for they tuke fearful of em e Haworth it line oâ€™ soothsayers, magishuns,
anâ€™ asstrologers; but whether they com fraâ€™t east orâ€™t west, they luke
oud fashunâ€™d enuff.  Nah tâ€™ city is situated in a very romantic part oâ€™
Yorkshur, and within two or three miles oâ€™t boundary mark oâ€™ Lancashire.
Some foak sez it wer tâ€™last place at wer made, but itâ€™s a mistak, for it
lukes oud fashunâ€™d enuff to be tâ€™first â€™at wer made.  Gert travellers sez
it resembles tâ€™ cities oâ€™ Rome and Edinburgh, fer therâ€™s a deal oâ€™
up-hills afore you can get toâ€™t top onâ€™t; but e landing youâ€™d be struck
wiâ€™ wonder and amazementâ€”what wiâ€™t tall biggens, monniments, domes,
hampitheaters, and so on; fer instance, tâ€™Church, or rather the
Cathedral, is a famous biggen, and stands majestically oâ€™t top at hill.
It hes been sed at Oliver Cromwell that wor so struck wiâ€™t appearance at
Church an tâ€™ City, altogether, wal he a mack a consented to hev it the
hed-quarters for the army and navy.

The faander oâ€™ tâ€™ Church is sed to be won Wang-be-Wang, won et Emprorâ€™s
oâ€™ China as com ower in a balloon anâ€™ browt we him all his relations, but
his granmuther; the natives at that toime wur a mack a wild, but i mixing
up we tâ€™ balloonites they soin become civilized and bigâ€™d tâ€™ Church atâ€™s
studden fra that time to nah, wit exepshun oâ€™ won end, destroyed at sum
toime, sum sez it wur be war.  Sum sez west and an tâ€™ saath end wur
destroyed, but itâ€™s a mack a settled on wit wiseuns it wur wichcraft; but
be it as it may Haworth, anâ€™ tâ€™ folk aâ€™tagether is as toff as paps, anâ€™
hez stud aht weel, anâ€™ no daht but it wod a flerished before Lunden,
Parriss, or Jerusulum, for sentries back, if theyâ€™d hed a Railway; but
after nearly all Grate Britten and France hed been furnished we a
Railway, the people i Haworth began to be uneazy and felt inclined no
longer to wauk several miles to get to a stashun if they were bahn off
liks.  And besides, they thout it wur high time to begin and mack sum
progress iâ€™ tâ€™ wurld, like their naburs â€™t valley.  So they adjetated for
a line down the valley as far as Keighley, and after abaht a hundred
meetings they gat an Act passed for it i Parlement.  So at last a
Cummittee wur formed, and they met wun neet a purpose to decide when it
wod be tâ€™ best convenient for em to dig tâ€™ furst sod to commerate and
start the gert event.  And a bonny rumpus there wor yo mind, for yo may
think ha it wor conducted when they wur threapin wi wun another like a
lot oâ€™ oud wimen at a parish pump when it sud be.  Wun sed it mud tak
place at rushberring, another sed next muck-spreading toime, a third sed
it mud be dug et gert wind-day e memory oâ€™ oud Jack Kâ€”.  Well, noan et
proposishuns wod do for tâ€™ lot, and there wur such opposistion wal it
omust hung on a threed, wether the railway went on or net, wal at last an
oud farmer, wun oâ€™ the committee-men, we a voice as hoarse as a farm yard
dog, bawls aht, I propose Pancake Tuesday.  So after a little more noise
it wor proposed and seconded at the Grand Trunk Railway between the
respective tahns of Keighley and Haworth sud be commemorated wi diggin tâ€™
furst sod oâ€™ Pancake Tuesday, it year oâ€™ our Lord 1864; and be tâ€™ show oâ€™
hands it usual way it wor carried by wun, and that wor Ginger Jabus, and
tâ€™tother cud a liked tâ€™bowt him ower, but Jabus wornâ€™t to be bowt that
time, for he hed his hart and sowl i the movement, and he went abaht
singinâ€”

   Cum all ye lads oâ€™ high renown
   At wishes well your native town,
   Rowl up anâ€™ put your money down
         Anâ€™ let us hev a Railway.
   We Keighley folk we are behind,
   Anâ€™s sed to wauk agin wur mind;
   But sooin tâ€™ crookt-leggâ€™d uns they will find,
         Weel kap em we a Railway.

Well, hasumivver public notice wur made nawn, be the bellman crying it
all ower tâ€™taan, wich he did to such a pitch, wal heâ€™d summat to do to
keep his hat fra flyin off, but he manijed to do it at last to a nicety,
for the news spread like sparks aht of a bakehus chimla; and wen the day
com they flocked in fra all parts, sum oâ€™ the crookt-legged uns fra
Keighley com, Lockertown and the Owertown folk com, and oud batchelors
fra Stanbury and all parts et continent oâ€™ Haworth; folk craaded in oâ€™
all sides, even the oud men and wimen fra Wicken Crag and the Flappeters,
and strappin folk they are yo mind, sum as fat as pigs, wi heads as red
as carrots, and nimble as a india-rubber bouncer taw; and wat wur tâ€™ best
onâ€™t it happened to be a fine day; for if it hed been made according to
orders it cudnâ€™t a been finer.  Shops wur all closed and ivverybody, oud
and young, hed a haliday aht oâ€™ tâ€™doors, for they wur all flade a missin
the Grand Processhun, wich formed itsel at the top oâ€™ Wuthren, when it
wur messured, it turnâ€™d aht to be two miles six inches longâ€”it moved as
follows:â€”



ORDER OF PROCESSHUN.


  The Spring-head Band wi their hat-bruads turnâ€™d up so as they mud see
                             their way clear.

Lord et Manor i full uniform a fut back bearing Coat of Arms for Haworth,
          a gert wild cratur wi two tails on, one et awthur end.

             Two citizens wi white cravats raand their hats.

The Members et Corporashun one-abreast singin â€œa nuttin we will go, brave
                                  boys.â€

                         Big Drums and Triangles.

   A Mahogany Wheelbarrow and a silver trowel on a cart trailâ€™d wi six
           donkeys, and garded wi ten lazy policemen all sober.

                        A pair of crakt bag-pipes.

    The Contractor in a sedan carried wi two waggoners i white smocks.

 All the young maidens fra fourteen to thirty-nine, six-abreast, drest i
                    sky blue, and singin throo combs.

                   Twenty oud wimin knittin stockings.

  Twenty navvies i their shirt sleeves weeling barrows, wi workn tooils.

        Taan skavengers wi shoulderâ€™d besums decorated wi ribbons.

Bellman and Pinder arm-i-arm drest I full uniform, and the latter now and
                 then bawlin aht wats bahn to tak place.

   All scholars at female line laking at duck-under-watter kit, and the
      males laking at frog-loup, and jumping oâ€™ one anotherâ€™s backs.

        Taan chimla sweeps maanted oâ€™ donkies wi their face white.

 All the furiners fra the continent oâ€™ Haworth, and crookt-legged uns fra
                          Keighley followed up.

   Bulk oâ€™ the inhabitants wauking wun-abreast, wi their hats off, and
                           singing and shouting

                       â€œThe Railway! the Railway!â€

In fact, the Railway wur e ivverbodyâ€™s maath, what we singing and
shouting, them at cud do nawther whisperâ€™d in wun anotherâ€™s earsâ€”Railway!
But getting to where the ceremuny wur to tak place the processhun halted
and formed itseln into a raand ring, and cheers wur geen wi shakin hats
and handkerchiefs, which lasted wal their showders and arms warkt wal
theyâ€™d hardly strength to shut their maaths and don their hats on.  But
hasumivver they manijed to get reight agean, and then a parson called Ned
Oufield gat up and made the following narashunâ€”

Fellow countrymen and citizens oâ€™ Haworth,â€”It gives me gert plezur to see
such a gert event as this tak place i the city oâ€™ Haworth, namely,
digging tâ€™ furst sod oâ€™ watâ€™s called Grand Trunk Line between Keighley
and yor native element, and reight pleased I am to offishiate as chairman
on this occashun.  Perhaps sum on yo maint naw what I mean wi yer native
element; but I mean yer oud mountain side, and aw naw yor like yer
forefathers, yo love it dearly, thoâ€™ yor ancestors wor nowt but
barbarians in the fourth and fifth sentries, yet they were the furst to
embrace Christianity, which they did it yer 600, be the Latin inscripshun
on the church steeple.â€”(Loud cheers).â€”And although yo been behind we yor
Railway, ye been up i different arts and sciences.  Wat nashun, my
frends, can boast of a majishun like yor oud Jack Kâ€”.â€”(Loud cheers).  He
wur a credit to yo all, and yo wur sadly indebted to him; he proffesied
twenty yer sin at this event wud cum to pass (a voice,â€”ha wish he wur
alive he sud be contractor), and if heâ€™d been livin to this day, its a
hundred to wun but the Railway wud hev been made to some where else ner
Keighley, for ha feel convinced et Keighley is not worthy of amalgamashun
wi a respectable city like Haworth.â€”(Hear, hear.)  For look wat insultin
langwidj theyâ€™ve used to yo at different times.â€”(Groans.)  Furst, they
said yo muckt church to mak it grow bigger.  Then yo walked rahnd tahnâ€™s
post office at Keighley and thout it wur the cemetery, and to make up for
the lot, they call us wild craturs and mock wur plezant dialect, which is
better English ner theirs.â€”(Groans, wich lasted for ten minits.)  Yes, my
fella citizens, youâ€™ve hed to put up wi a deal oâ€™ slang fra theas
uncultivated rascals.â€”(We have.)  And watâ€™s war nur all, yahâ€™ve hed to
wauk wet and dry, thro thick and thin, i all sorts oâ€™ weather to
Keighley, wen youâ€™ve wanted to go on the continent or Lundun.  But soin
yo can wauk slap to the train in a jiffey.â€”(Loud cheers.)  Mr. Oufield
then thenkt his fella taansmen and wimen and ended his speech wi
expressin his delight in the loyalty of the people for the railway, and
as the time was fast waxin, he begged leave to sit dahn, wich he did tâ€™
midst lahd enthusiastic shouting.

This been dun and ivverybody gotten their maaths shut agean, Ike Ouden
gat up and made a speech, and a grand un it wor yo mind, for if the
arkangel hed dropt streyt dahn fra heven and let oâ€™ tâ€™top oâ€™ tâ€™platform,
it cuddant a suited tâ€™ folk better, for he began as follows:â€”

Fella-citizens and tahnsmen oâ€™ Haworth,â€”Wen I see before me so many
smiling faces and so many distingwisht citizens, I awn ha felt a pang as
to my unfitness for appearing afore yo on this occashun; but yor
committee wor so urgent in their appeal to me that I wor certainly
induced to akcept the honnor of diggin the furst sod oâ€™ the Grand Trunk
Railway, wich will be the gratest blessin that ivver will be i Haworth.
But yet its not for me to say wat is kalkulated or unkalkulated for the
people oâ€™ Haworth to do in the 19th sentry, yet I may ventur to say at
this glorious muvment nah bahn to tak place will shortly prove the
gratest blessin ivver witnessed it city oâ€™ Haworth.â€”(Loud applause).
Look at the export and import of the city, and compare the spavenâ€™d horse
and cart wi the puffin willyams and all the fine carriages.  Look et
difference between wen it tuk a week to go to Liverpool, and a month to
Lundun, in a oud coach, and hev to mak wur wills afore we
went.â€”(Enthusiastic cheering.)  Yes, my frends, we stud good chance e
being robbed and plundered if net summat war.  Besides wat an immense
diffrence it will mak to Haworth, wen shoo can export her own
mannifacturs to all the civilised and uncivilised wurld, and by means oâ€™
steam find their ways into rejuns nivver trod but by feet oâ€™ wild craturs
and beasts oâ€™ prey.  But to mak tâ€™ story short ha mean to say it will be
a grate cumfort and a blessin to both the lame and lazey, and speshally
to the latter.  But as the time was gettin on fastish, as it allus dus
when thereâ€™s out to be dun, so Mr. Ouden finisht his speech as follows:â€”

   Put yor shoulders to work, lads, and neâ€™er be danted,
      Think yer behint and thereâ€™s no time to dally,
   For nah is the time yor assistance is wanted
      I makin yor railway along the Worth Valley.

The Spring-heead Band then played sum of their favorite tunes, â€œOud Rosen
the Bow,â€ â€œJesseyâ€™s Pig,â€ and ended wi â€œGod save the Queen,â€ and all
departed to their homes wi smiling faces.



CHAPTER II.


   Gather fra Stanbury, lads we yor carrot heeads,
   Cum dahn fra Locker tahn, lads, be the railway;
   Cum we yor wives, yor dowters, and relatives,
   Shout lads, shout for the Worth Valley Railway.

   Heard you Ned Oufield mak his noration,
   Yohâ€™l say in yohr conshunce he spak it reyt fairly,
   He said poor Haworth nivver yet hed fairashun,
   And spak of the thing that will flurish it rarely.
                  Railway, &c.

   Saw yoh Icholden wi his mahogany wheelbarrow,
   Cum dig the first sod wi his trowel oâ€™ silver,
   He wheeled it dahn tâ€™ plenk as streyt as an arrow,
   And tipt it as weel as a navvy or delver.
                  Railway, &c.

   Saw yoh the church so anshent in history,
   Read yoh the Latin words high in the steeple,
   Hear to the sounds that arise from the belfry,
   It seems to be shaating along wi the people,
                  Railway, &c.

Nah then, lads, for wark; nout but wark al do, and these at canâ€™t work
mun plan.  This wor the cry all up and dahn Haworth next mornin, and for
weeks all wor vary bizzy.  Won man made a weel-barra it chamber but it
wor so big wal it couldnâ€™t be gotten aht withaht takin the haase side
dahn.  Another invented a koulin-masheen to koul tâ€™ muck up both sides to
save wheelbarras and work tooils for the navvies.  Some started a
practicing for porters at the railway, wi oppenin and shutting the oven
doors wi a bang, shating aht at the same time, â€œAll aht for Haworth.â€
Wun man wor trying the dodge on, and the cat wor it ovan, and poor thing,
expecting that it wor it the wrong place, jumpt aht just at time at he
wor whistling to start, and wor catcht bi the tail and the poor thing
lost it, for it wur cut off as clean as a whistle.  A crookt leggâ€™d
pedlar com fra Keighley wun day wi winter-edges, and they tuke him for a
sapper and miner et hed cum to mezhur for the railway, and mind yoh they
did mak summat on him, they thout that the winter-edges wur the apparatus
to mezhur by.  But hasumivver, the reyt uns com at after, and a sore
disaster they hed yo mind, for they laid the plans oâ€™ tâ€™railway dahn at
green swarth, and a oud kah belanging to Blue Beard swallowed tâ€™ job;
they tried ta save em but all i vain: a sore do wur this for both folk
and the railway, for it put em a year or two back, and folk wur raging
mad abaht tâ€™ kah, and if it hednt a been a wizzenâ€™d oud thing theyâ€™d a
swallowed it aliveâ€”the nasty greedy oud thing.

   They hed a meeting tother neet,
   Fair oâ€™ tâ€™top oâ€™ Wutherin Street,
   To see what things theyâ€™d got complete,
   Concerning Haworth Railway.

   Wen Penny Wabbac tuke the chair,
   He lukt to be i grate despair,
   He sez, good folk, are yoh aware,
   Watâ€™s happened to the Railway.

   We persperashun on his brah,
   He sez, good folk, al tell yoh nah;
   Oud Blue Beardâ€™s nasty wizened kah
   Hes swallowed plan oâ€™ tâ€™ Railway.

   Wi these remarks poor Wabbac sat,
   Wen Jonny Broth doft off his hat,
   His een they blazed like sum wild cat
   Wi vengence for the Railway.

   He sed my blud begins to boil,
   To think et we sud work anâ€™ toil,
   And evâ€™n the cattle cannot thoyle
   To let us hev a Railway.

   On hearing this the Haworth foak
   Began to swear it wur no joak,
   An wisht at greedy cah ma choak,
   At swallowed tâ€™ plan oâ€™ tâ€™ Railway.

But hasumivver they gat ower this, and wur not long at after afore they
hed more disasters, such as tunnils shutterin, and chapels sinkin, and
law suits, and so on, wal Haworthers thout be tâ€™ hart at both the fouk
and the grund wur soft dahn at Keighley, and threttened to comb sum oâ€™
the crookt-legged ens their heeads if they insinuated; and the Volunteers
threttened to tak their part if there wur owt to do; and farther ner
that, they vowed that they were ready to go to war wi onny nashun that
sud insult awther them or ther railway under the present difficulties.

   But sighs and tears and doubts and fears,
      Prevails with greatest folly,
   For â€™t sinagog has cockt its clog,
      And â€™t parsonâ€™s melancholy.

   Tunnils sink and navvies drink,
      And chapels are upsetting;
   For Railway Shares nobody cares,
      And iverybodyâ€™s fretting.

   The iron horse they curse of course,
      And fane wud it abandon;
   And loyers fees their pockets ease,
      A thousand pound e Lundun.

   Misfortunes speed as rank as weed,
      Anâ€™ puts on sich a damper;
   Wal tâ€™ foaks declare e grate dispair,
      Its up wiâ€™t iron tramper.

   The volunteers prick up their ears,
      An mak a famos rattle;
   Thay want ta run ta Wimbleton,
      Or onny field oâ€™ battle.

   Their black cravats an toppenâ€™d hats
      Are causing grate attraction;
   Against Boneypart thay want ta start,
      E reglar fightin action.

   The raw recuits hev got ther suits,
      Thay brag ta wun another:
   Taâ€™t first campaign thayâ€™l tak the train,
      Withaat the sliteist bother.

   But tâ€™ oud foak thinks thairâ€™l be some stinks,
      At menshun of invazhun;
   An hopes et taan will ride em daan,
      E cabs ta Howorth Stashun.

But hasumiver toime works wonders wi it an perseverance its gotten taâ€™t
last stage na, an foak is varry impashent fer it ta cum up, an thaâ€™re
preparin ta give it a grand recepshun; wun oud woman hes a peggy tub full
o meyl anâ€™ saar swillins for thâ€™ ingen, and they are preparin another
puddin for thâ€™ passengers fra Keighley.

   Theyâ€™re standing iâ€™ groups and theyâ€™re living iâ€™ hopes,
      And more disappointments they dread,
   Wiâ€™ theyâ€™re ears touching thâ€™ grand, theyâ€™ve harkenâ€™d for thâ€™ saand,
      Wal theyâ€™ve omust gone wrong iâ€™ ther head.

   Sez Dick oâ€™ Grate Beckers, just keep up yor peckers,
      Yo hevnâ€™t much longer to wait
   For blue milk and porridge, yol get better forridge,
      Wen the railway gets fairly agait.

   For its labour iâ€™ vain to harken for thâ€™ train
      When allâ€™s goin on varry steady;
   So pray yo be calm its takin no harm,
      Theyâ€™ll bring it as soin as its ready.

   For thâ€™ rails are all laid, and thereâ€™s nowt to be made,
      Nobbut thâ€™ navvies to clear off all thâ€™ muck;
   Then all al be goin, for thâ€™ Cowinhead mooin
      Is bahn to be browt on a truck.

   So Sam oâ€™ Blue Bills, wiâ€™ thiâ€™ pints anâ€™ thiâ€™ gills,
      Its bahn to be better for thee,
   To Keighley anâ€™ back tha ma go in a crack,
      When thaâ€™s bahn on a bit of a spree.

   And John oâ€™ Pot Anns tha mun alter thi plans,
      For tha nivver can get him iâ€™ force;
   For Iâ€™m happy to tell at steead oâ€™thâ€™ canal
      Theyâ€™re bahn to try thâ€™ big iron horse.

   Thereâ€™s oud Jim oâ€™ Kyas is bahn to be wise,
      Anâ€™ thâ€™ folk sez at heâ€™s takkin a hig;
   Heâ€™ll see it first tried afore he will ride,
      Heâ€™s dahn abaht the Paper Mill Brig.

   He sez heâ€™ll be sure, it dropt in before,
      And it might do again for a pinch;
   For he sez theyâ€™ll be kapt if sum on em trapt,
      So heâ€™s blest if heâ€™ll trust it an inch.

   Thereâ€™s oud Mally Brook hez been dahn to look,
      And shooâ€™s sore disappointed they say;
   Shooâ€™s omust goan crackt for shoo sez it weant act,
      For they nobbut can run it wun way.

   Sho sez at high class ats laid dahn all thâ€™ brass,
      Just nah theyâ€™re beginnin ta craw;
   To mak up for thâ€™ trouble theyâ€™re bahn to charge double,
      For bad speckulashun it law.

   So to sattle em dahn, Sir Chrestofer Brahn,
      Hez tould em it wur his intent,
   If theyâ€™d nobbut be quiet till things wur all reight,
      Heâ€™d give em a trip to Chow Bent.

Yes, and besides a trip to Chow Bent, they gat several more trips
promised bi thâ€™ diffrent distingwisht citizens oâ€™ Haworth.  Wun promised
to give em trip to Bullockâ€™s Smithy, anuther to Tingsley Bongs, wal they
wur getting quite up oâ€™ thersels and thâ€™ railway.  Or else theyâ€™d been
for many a year and cudnâ€™t sleep a wink at neet for dreamin abaht thâ€™
railway ingens, boilers, and so on, and mony a time theyâ€™ve wakkenâ€™d iâ€™
ther sleep shakkin thâ€™ bed posts, thinkin they wur setting thâ€™ ingen on
or stoppin it.  But theyâ€™d gotten reight and thout they wur bahn to hev
no more trouble; but alas! it wur a mistak, for on thâ€™ morning of the
14th oâ€™ November anâ€™ oud skyologer went aht a weather-gazin and
planet-ruling, and woful news and bad omens he browt back wiâ€™ him, for he
sed at thâ€™

   Stars wur shoiting in and aht,
   And gravel ratches wur abaht,
   And thâ€™ folk, he sed, they little knew
   What mischief it wur bahn ta brew.
   And news he spred abaht the tahn,
   What lots oâ€™ rain wud tumble dahn;
   And like his anshent sires he spoke,
   The shockin news withaht a joke.

   For soin the rain i torrents fell,
   And O what awful news to tell,
   It lookt as th clahds wur bahn to shutter,
   For every dyke, and ditch, and gutter,
   A reguler deluge did resemble,
   Which made Haworth folk to tremble.
   Some tried to stop its course wiâ€™ stones,
   And some dropt on their marrow bones,
   And hoped at if the wurld wur drahnd,
   The railway wud be safe anâ€™ sahnd;

   But prayers like these hed no avail,
   For thâ€™ waters deluged all the dale;
   And thâ€™ latest news et I hev heerd
   Thâ€™ railwayâ€™s nearly disappeared;
   But if its fun withaht a flaw,
   Wha, folks, Iâ€™m like to let yo know.



CHAPTER III.


    â€œWork boys, work, and be contented.â€

Ha, its all varry weel for the poit to sing that, but if he hed a railway
at stake he wud happen alter his tune, an espeshully if he wur an
eye-witness nah, for thâ€™ storm wur ragin at heyest, and the folks wur
waiting wiâ€™ pashent expectashun to knaw whether they wur bahn to be at an
end or not, for thâ€™ flooid wur coming dahn thicker anâ€™ faster, and there
lookâ€™d to be monny a hundred mile oâ€™ watter in the valley.  Hasumivver
they musterâ€™d all tâ€™ energy they cud, for they wur determined to knaw thâ€™
warst, so they went to see if they could find thâ€™ oud weather gazer at
hed proffesied thâ€™ flooid; and after a good deal oâ€™ runnin abaht, they
fan him peepin thru summat at shap of a tunnel.  Sum sed he wur lookin at
thâ€™ mooin, others sed he wor looking into futurity, hasumivver they asked
him to come dahn anâ€™ look at the railway, and tell em whether thâ€™ flooid
wur bahn to tak it away or not, but thâ€™ saucy oud hound refused at first,
for he said at he wur flaid at sum on em wodnâ€™t be able to stand thâ€™
shock if he tellâ€™d em thâ€™ warst, so thâ€™ oud lad sed

   If my advice yoh want, poor things,
      An cannut do withaht it,
   Go arm yor seln to thâ€™ teeth, he sed,
      Anâ€™ doant be long abaht it;
   Both rakes anâ€™ powls anâ€™ props anâ€™ ropes
      Yo cannot get ta sooin,
   Anâ€™ take the Cowinheeaderâ€™s plan
      When they discuverâ€™d the mooin,
   Doant gape abaht, but when yor armâ€™d
      Take each a diffrent rowt;
   And let yor cry be ivvery man,
      Thâ€™ poor railwayâ€™s up the spout.

It wurnt long afore they gat armâ€™dâ€”sum wi clothes props, muk forks,
ropes, and so on, and there wor some competition yo mind, for they wur
all trying which could mak best movement so as they could immortalise
their names it history of Haworth, for there wur one Joe Hobb, a handloom
weaver, browt his slay boards, and as he wor going dahn thâ€™ hill he did
mak some manÅ“vures, anâ€™ talk abaht fugal men it army when they throw
their guns up into thâ€™ air and catches em again, they wur nowt to Joe,
for he span his slay boards up anâ€™ dahn just like a shuttlecock.  But wal
all this wur going on the storm began to abate, and thâ€™ water seemâ€™d to
get less, but still they kept at it.  Wal at last a chap at they call
Dave Twirler shahted aht he saw summat, and they lookâ€™t way at he
pointed, and there behold it wur won oâ€™thâ€™ ribs oâ€™thâ€™ railway sticking up
(here a dead silence tuk place which lasted for abaht three hours) for
nobody durst open their mahths, flaid aâ€™thâ€™ wind wud mak thâ€™ current
stronger, and sum at wimen held their tungs to that pain and misery wal
their stockings fell dahn ower their clog tops; but hasumever thâ€™ silence
wur broken by a Haworth Parish chap at they call Bob Gimlet, he happened
to be there and he said nah lads, look down thâ€™ valley for I think I see
thâ€™ skeleton at onny rate, and Bob wur reight for it wur as plain to be
seen as an elephant in a shop window.

   And this wur a fact this wur thâ€™ railway they saw,
   And at thâ€™ first sight oâ€™ thâ€™ spectre they all stood in awe,
   For it wur smashed all iâ€™ pieces ashamed to be seen
   As thoâ€™ it hed passed throâ€™ a sausidge masheen;
   Wi horror some fainted, while others took fits,
   Aud these at cud stand it wur piking up tâ€™bits.

   But after a while when they all becum calm,
   They gathered together like bees in a swarm,
   Resolvd to pick up all fragments and thâ€™ wood,
   And splice â€™em together as weel as they cud,
   Hasumever thay started a putting it streyt,
   And wiâ€™ spelking and braying they soon made it reight.

   Six months nah elapsed and thâ€™ gert job wur done,
   And thâ€™ next thing to argue wur wen it sud run,
   So they sent Joe a-Stirks arahnd wiâ€™ his bell,
   And gave him strict orders at he wur to tell,
   At thâ€™ inspector hed been and examined it throâ€™,
   And cum to thâ€™ conclushun et thâ€™ railway wud do.

   So to wark wi a vengance, the bellman set to,
   To warn up a meeting to meet aâ€™thâ€™ Black Bull,
   It wud dun yo all good to hear Joey shaht,
   For they heard him distinctly for miles all abaht,
   And iâ€™ less ner ten minits, they flockt in so fast,
   While Jonny Broth horses they couldnâ€™t get past.

   So they framâ€™d on wiâ€™ thâ€™ meeting anâ€™ thâ€™ chairman spak first,
   And tellâ€™d â€™em at thâ€™ railway wur finishâ€™d at last;
   And declared at thâ€™ inspector hed passed when he com,
   Both viaducts and bridges as sahnd as a plum;
   As for sinkin agean they wud do nowt et sort,
   For they sailed throâ€™ the arches iâ€™ Marrinerâ€™s boat.

   So he hoped iâ€™ this meeting they all wud agree,
   And settle when thâ€™ oppening oâ€™ thâ€™ railway sud be.
   He thout for his part thoâ€™ he nobbut wur won,
   At first day oâ€™ April wur fittest to run,
   Wen a voice sed, sit dahn or Iâ€™ll pelt thee wiâ€™ spooils,
   Duz ta think at wur bahn to be April fooils?

   Then up on to thâ€™ platform jumpâ€™d Red Dicky Brook,
   Along wiâ€™ his uncle Black Tom at Dyke Nook,
   Determined to sattle and bring things arahnd,
   As thâ€™ railway wur finished both proper and sahnd;
   So they pitched on a dayâ€”this wur April the fourth.
   To oppen thâ€™ grand railway fra Lunden to Haworth.

   It wur carried as usual, biâ€™ thâ€™ showing oâ€™ hands,
   Amidst grate rejoicing and playing oâ€™ bands,
   Both oud men and wimen hed a smile on their face,
   For all wur dead certain this wur bahn to tak place,
   So they fled to their homes like bees to a hive,
   Impashent and anshus for thâ€™ day to arrive.

   Hasumever thâ€™ day com at wur menshunâ€™d before,
   And folk wur all flocking fra mahntan and thâ€™ moor,
   And little they thout when they set off that morn,
   Anuther disaster would laff â€™em to scorn;
   For Joe Stirk wur sent out to tell â€™em to stop,
   For poor Haworth Railway hed gotten iâ€™ pop.

   Nah this wur a damper and thâ€™ biggest iâ€™ thâ€™ lot,
   And thâ€™ folks they declared this wur a Keighley plot,
   But one Jack oâ€™ Ludges sed heâ€™d stop â€™em their prate,
   Heâ€™d learn â€™em iâ€™ Keighley to insinuate,
   Theyâ€™st hev no excurshuns for nout but their lip,
   And Shipley and Bradford should hev the first trip.

   He sed heâ€™d been quiet, but heâ€™d nah interfere,
   Heâ€™d wauk up to Derby and tell em up there,
   Hah they hed been skitted, sin first they begun,
   And nah when this wur finished they wurnt to run;
   But hah he went on I never did hear,
   But won thing Iâ€™m certain he must a been there.

   For thâ€™ tenth day of April bills wur put aht,
   That thâ€™ railway wud oppen withaht any daht,
   And a famous excurshun fra Bradford wod run,
   And call at all stashuns wiâ€™ thâ€™ excepshun oâ€™ won;
   For nowt aht oâ€™ Keighley to Haworth sud ride,
   For that day all thâ€™ luggage wur left oâ€™ won side.

   Scarce Keighley crookt-leggâ€™d ens heard oâ€™ the news,
   And wur just bahn to give â€™em the gratest abuse,
   When a order cum aht fra sum unknawn source,
   That Keighley crookt-leggâ€™d ens cud go up of course,
   They thowt it wur best, and wud cause the least bother,
   For wun sud be welcum as weel as anuther.

   Hasumever their hopes hes not been iâ€™ vain,
   For the dayâ€™s arrived and yonderâ€™s the train,
   And thahsands oâ€™ folks is flocking to thâ€™ spot,
   The gent fra his hall, the peasant fra his cot,
   For all are determined as thâ€™ weather is fine,
   To hev anâ€™ excurshun up thâ€™ Worth Valley Line.

   They land up iâ€™ Haworth, and sports et is seen,
   Wur nivver yet equalled it reign oâ€™ the Queen,
   Such processhuns wi music yo neâ€™er saw the like,
   They wur bands fra all nashuns excepting Black Dyke,
   And Sham oâ€™ Blue Bills sed heâ€™d kick up a shine,
   For nah they hed oppenâ€™d the Worth Valley Line.

   There wur Jim oâ€™thâ€™ Damems, and Will oâ€™ thâ€™ Gooise Coit,
   And the lads at wur in that puddin exploit,
   There wur Ned dahn fra Oakworth, and Ike fra Loin Ends,
   Along wi their aristocratical friends,
   They repairâ€™d to Black Bull, of sahnd puddin to dine,
   That day at they oppenâ€™d the Worth Valley Line.

   Iâ€™ all nooks and corners and chimla tops,
   Wur floating gert banners wiâ€™ mighty big props,
   And stampâ€™d on each flag iâ€™ figures so nice,
   Sum anâ€™ inscripshun and sum a device;
   But thâ€™ nicest iâ€™thâ€™ lump at swung on a band,
   Wur welcum to Haworth fra ivvery land.

   Yor welcum, yor welcum, all men upon earth,
   Yor welcum to the valley of Worth,
   Fra thâ€™ Humber to thâ€™ Mersey, fra thâ€™ Thames dahn to thâ€™ Tyne,
   Yor welcum to travel the Worth Valley Line.



CHAPTER IV.


    â€œThâ€™ last Scene of all that ends this strange eventful history.â€

_Fra thâ€™ Corrispondent oâ€™ thâ€™ Hoylus End Mercury_.

   Good folks youâ€™ve inkwired at home anâ€™ abroad,
   Ha weâ€™re gettin on wi wur famous railroad;
   And when Iâ€™ve tellâ€™d yo the disasters weâ€™ve hed,
   Yoâ€™ve greeved monny a time wal yoâ€™ve tain to yor bed,
   But ha yo will gape when yo read farther dahn,
   What famons big stirrins weâ€™ve hed up iâ€™thâ€™ tahn.

   I knaw yoâ€™d be mad as soin as yo heard,
   Abaht that oud kah at belongâ€™d to Blue Beard,
   For I like as I saw yo just hod of its tail,
   And braying it rump wiâ€™ the end oâ€™ yor flail;
   For I wisht monny a time at yo hed been here,
   For swallowing the plan yoâ€™d a geen it what cheer.

   Ha ivver good folk Iâ€™ll try to be breef,
   For I knaw youâ€™re iâ€™ pain and Iâ€™ll give yo releefâ€”
   So to tell yo the truth in a plain, honnest way,
   The railroad is finishâ€™d an oppenâ€™d to-day;
   And Iâ€™ve tain up my pen for ill yoâ€™d a taint,
   If I hednt a geen yo a truthful ackahnt.

   Hasumivver this morning, as I tellâ€™d yo before,
   I wur wakkenâ€™d wi hearin a awful uproar,
   What wiâ€™ the prating oâ€™ wimen and the shahtin oâ€™thâ€™ folk,
   And the bells at wur ringin, they wur past onny joke,
   For ivvery two minnits they shahted hurrah,
   We are nah bahn to oppen the Haworth Railway.

   So I jumpâ€™d up iâ€™ bed, anâ€™ I gat on the floor,
   I slipt on my cloas and ran out at door,
   And the first at I met, it wur one Jimmy Peg,
   He cumâ€™d up fra Bocking and brout a gert flag,
   And just at his heels wur the Spring-headed band,
   Playing a marchâ€”I thout it wur grand.

   So I fell into the step for I knaw how to march,
   For Iâ€™ve been stiffenâ€™d up wiâ€™ guvernment starch;
   And first smell oâ€™ music it maks me fair dance,
   And I prick up my ears like a trooper his lance,
   Hasumivver, I thout as Iâ€™d gotten iâ€™ thâ€™ scent,
   Iâ€™d follow this music wharever it went.

   Then I marchâ€™d up erect, wal I come to the grand stand,
   And that wur aâ€™ thâ€™ stashun where the train hed to land;
   There wur flags of all nashuns fra the Union Jack
   To Bacchus and Atlas wiâ€™ the globe on his back,
   For the Inspector and conductor and all sorts oâ€™ fray
   Wur expected directly to land at the railway.

   So I starâ€™d wal both een wur varry near bleared,
   And waited and waitedâ€”at last it appearâ€™d,
   It wur filled full oâ€™ folk as eggs full oâ€™ meat,
   And it tuk four ingens to bring it up reight,
   Two hed long chimlas and thâ€™ tuther hed noan,
   But they stuck weel together like a dog to a bone.

   They wur gruntin and growling wur the folks at gat aht,
   So I made some inquiries what it wur abaht;
   And iâ€™ all my born days I neâ€™er heard nout so callâ€™d,
   For three or four times they sed it hed stallâ€™d,
   Wal some oâ€™thâ€™ crookt-leggâ€™d ens bethout of a scheam,
   And they went back to Keighley for a hamper oâ€™steam.

   And my word and honour it did mak a gert din,
   For I stud by and heard it, and saw it come in;
   I expected it coming as quiet as a lamb,
   But no daht at the noises wur nobbut a sham;
   But whatâ€™s the use oâ€™ telling yo ha it did come,
   Iâ€™d forgotten yoâ€™d ridden to Wibsey begum.

   There wur fifty iâ€™ number invited to dine,
   All us at hed acted reight loyal to the line;
   So I thout that Iâ€™d go, for I knew weel enuff
   At the puddings this time wud be made at reight stuff,
   And noan oâ€™ that stuffment they gav the Keighley band,
   Toan awf on it rubbish and the other awf sand.

   For twelve stone oâ€™ flour (3lbs. to a man)
   Wur boiled iâ€™ oud Bingleechinâ€™s kah lickin pan,
   Wi gert lumps oâ€™ suet at the cook hed put inâ€™t,
   At shane like a ginney just new aht at mint;
   Wiâ€™ knives made a purpose to cut it iâ€™ rowls,
   And the sauce wur iâ€™ buckets and mighty big bowls.

   They wur chattin and taukin and souckin ther spice,
   And crackin at dainties they thout at wur nice,
   Wal the oud parson gat up and pullâ€™d a long face,
   And mutterâ€™d some words at they call saying thâ€™ grace,
   But I nivver goamâ€™d that, cos I knew for a fact
   It wur nobbut a signal for the puddin attack.

   And awâ€™l tell yo wot, folk thoâ€™ yo maint beleeve,
   But yo tauks abaht Wibsey fooak heytin horse beef,
   Yo sud a seen Locker-taaners brandishing ther nives,
   An choppin an cutting ther wollopin shives;
   An all on em shaatin thay likâ€™d th puddin th best,
   Fer nout wur like th puddin for standin thâ€™ test.

   An while thay wor cutting an choppin away,
   The gallant Spring-Heeaders wor orderâ€™d ta play,
   But thay didnâ€™t mich loike it fer ivvery wun,
   Wur flaid at thayd play wol th puddin wor dun;
   But as luck wor thay ticeâ€™d em, wi a gert deeal to do,
   Ta play Roger the Plowman an Rozzen the bow.

   Ike Ouden wor th chairman at com to preside,
   An Will Thompson o Guiseley wor set by his soide,
   Na Willâ€™s a director oâ€™th Midland line,
   An as deeacent a chap as sat dahn ta dine;
   Along wi Jin Sugden at held th Vice-chair,
   Wor won Billy Brayshaw, Bradford Lord Mayor.

   Their wor Jonathan Craven, Mic Morrell and me,
   And a lot o more lads at wur for a spree;
   There wur Nedwin o Georgeâ€™s and Pete Featherstone,
   They sat side by side like Darby and Joan;
   And I hardly can tell yo, but yor noan to a shade,
   But I knaw they wur Ingham and little Jack Wade.

   So he says, be silent, all the folk iâ€™ this hall,
   So as any won on yo can hear a pin fall;
   And Jone oâ€™ Bill Olders just shut up thiâ€™ prate,
   For Iâ€™ve summat to say and I mun let it aht;
   For I mun hev silence whativer betide,
   Or Iâ€™ll cum aht oth loom and some oâ€™ yo hide.

   Three years hes elapsed and weâ€™re going on the fourth,
   Sin we first started th railway fra Keighley to Haworth
   What wiâ€™ dreamin by neet, and workin by day,
   Its been to poor Haworth a dearish railway.
   And monny a time Iâ€™ve been aht oâ€™ patience
   Wiâ€™ the host oâ€™ misfortunes and miscalculations.

   The first do at we hed wur th kah swallowing th plan,
   And then wur bad luck and misfortunes began;
   For before Ginger Jabus cud draw us another,
   All went on wrong and weâ€™d a gert deal oâ€™ bother;
   He must a been dreamin, a silly oud clahn,
   For three fields oâ€™ Oud Doodles he nivver put dahn.

   As for thee, Jonny Broth, itâ€™s a pity I knaw,
   For thart one oâ€™ the best drivers at ivver I saw;
   And nobody can grumble at what tha hes dun,
   If thi buss driven wearisome race it is run;
   For who nah cud grumble, ha fine wur thur cloth,
   To ride up to Haworth wi oud Johnny Broth.

   So Johnny, my lad, donâ€™t thee mak onny fuss,
   I shuttin thi horses, or sellin thi buss;
   For if the railway hes done thee, thereâ€™s wun thing I knaw;
   Tha mud mak â€™o thâ€™ oud bus a stunnin peep show,
   And if I meet thee at Lunden, tho two hundred miles,
   I sall patronise thee if it be in St. Giles.

   So strike up yor music and give it some mahth,
   And welcum all nashuns fra north to the sahth;
   The black fra the east, and the red fra the west,
   For they sud be welcum as weel as the rest:
   And all beyond the Tiber, the Baltic or Rhine,
   Shall knaw at weâ€™ve oppenâ€™d the Worth Valley Line.




Tâ€™ Village Aram-Skaram.


   In a little cot so dreary,
   With eyes and forehead hot and bleary,
   Sat a mother sad and weary,
         With her darling on her knee;
   Their humble fare at best was sparing,
   For the father he was shearing,
   With his three brave sons oâ€™ Erin,
         Down in the Fen country.

   All her Saxon neighbours leave her,
   With her boy and demon fever,
   The midnight watchâ€”none to relieve her,
         Save a Little Bisey Bee:
   He was called the Aram-Skaram,
   Noisy as a drum clock laram,
   Yet his treasures he would share â€™em,
         With his friend right merrily.

   Every night and every morning,
   With the day sometimes at dawning,
   While the mother, sick and swooning,
         To his dying mate went he:
   Robbing his good Saxon mother,
   Giving to his Celtic brother,
   Who askedâ€”for him and no other,
         Until his spirit it was free.

   Saw the shroud and saw the coffin;
   Brought the pipes and brought the snuff in;
   This little noble-hearted ruffin,
         At the wake each night went he:
   Sabbath morning he was ready,
   Warnâ€™d the bearers to be steady,
   Taking Peter to his Biddy,
         And a tear stood in his eâ€™e.

   Onward as the corpse was passing,
   Ere the priest gave his last blessing,
   Through the dingy crowd came pressing,
         The father and the brothers three:
   â€™Tis our motherâ€”we will greet her;
   How is this that here we meet her?
   And without our little Peter,
         Who will solve this mystery?

   The Aram-Skaram interfered,
   Soon this corpse will be interred,
   Come with us and see it burried,
         Out in yonder cemetery:
   Soon they knew the worst, and pondered
   Half-amazed and half-dumbfounded;â€”
   And returning home, they wondered
         Who their little friend could be!

   Turning round to him they bowed,
   Much they thanked him, much they owed;
   While the tears each cheek bedewed,
         Wisht him all prosperity:
   â€œNever mind,â€ he said, â€œmy brothers,
   What I have done, do ye to others;
   Weâ€™re all poor barns oâ€™ some poor mothers,â€
         Said the little Bisey Bee.




Behold How the Rivers!


   Behold how the rivers flow down to the sea,
   Sending their treasures so careless and free;
   And to give their assistance each Spring doth arise,
   Uplifting and singing my songs to the skies.

   Find out the haunts oâ€™ the low human pest,
   Give to the weary, the poor, and distressed;
   What if unthankful and thankless they be,
   Think of the giver that gave unto thee.

   Go travel the long lanes on miseryâ€™s virge,
   Find out their dark dens, and list to their dirge;
   Where want and famine, and by ourselves made,
   Forgive our frail follies, and come to our aid.

   Give to yon widowâ€”thy gift is thrice blest,
   For thoâ€™ she be silent, the harder sheâ€™s pressed;
   A small bit oâ€™ help to the little she earns,
   God blesses the giver to fatherless bairns.

   â€™Neath the green grassy mounds oâ€™ yon little church yard,
   An over-wrought genius there finds his reward;
   And marvel thee not, when I say unto thee,
   Such are the givers that give unto me.

   Then scatter thy mite like nature her rain,â€”
   What if no birdie should chant thee a strain;
   What if no daisy should smile on the lea;
   The sweet honeysuckle will compensate thee.

   For the day will soon come, if thou gives all thou may,
   That thou mayest venture to give all away;
   Ere nature again her balmy dews send,
   Thou may have vanished my good giving friend.




The Worldâ€™s Wheels.


   Aw steady anâ€™ easy tâ€™oud worldâ€™s wheels wod go,
   If tâ€™folk wod be honist anâ€™ try to keep so;
   Anâ€™ at steead oâ€™ been hastey at ivvery wun,
   Let us enquire afore we condemn.

   A man may do wrong anâ€™ scarce be to blame,
   Or a woman be bad e nout bud her name;
   But which on us ought ta say ought unto them,
   Unless we enquire afore we condemn.

   If a Rose she sud flurish her sisters among,
   It izant ta say her poor sister is wrong;
   That blighted one there may be nipt in the stem,
   So let us enquire before we condemn.

   Yond vessel that tussels the ocean to plough,
   While waves they are dashing and winds they do blow,
   May be shattered asunder from stern unto stem,
   So let us inquire before we condemn.

   We are certain oâ€™ wun thing anâ€™ that izant two,
   If we do nothing wrong we have nothing to rue;
   Yet many a bright eye may be full to the brim,
   So let us inquire afore we condemn.

   Then speak not so harshly, withdraw that rash word,
   â€™Tis wrong to condemn till the story is heard;
   If it worrant for summat sho might be a gem,
   So let us enquire afore we condemn.




Full oâ€™ Doubts anâ€™ Fears.


   Sweet sing the birds in lowly strains,
      All mingled in their song;
   For lovely Spring is here again,
      And Winterâ€™s cold is gone.

   All things around seem filled with glee,
      And joy swells every breast;
   The buds are peeping from each bush,
      Where soon the birds will rest.

   The meadows now are fresh and green,
      The flowers are bursting forth,
   And nature seems to us serene,
      And shows her sterling worth.

   The lark sores high up in the air,
      We listen to his lays;
   He knows no sorrow nor no care,
      Nor weariness oâ€™ days.

   But men, though born of noble birth,
      Assigned for higher spheres,
   Walks his sad journey here on earth
      All full oâ€™ doubts and fears.




 It Izant so we Me.


   Bright seems the days when I was young
      Fra thought, fra care, fra sorrow free;
   As wild waves rippled iâ€™ the sun,
      Rolled gaily on, and so wiâ€™ me.

   More bright the flowers when I was young,
      More sweet the birds sang on the tree;
   While pleasure and contentment flung
      Her smiles on them, and so wiâ€™ me.

   The naked truth, I told when young,
      Though tempted wi hypocracy;
   Though some embraced from it I sprang,
      And said it izant so wiâ€™ me.

   Aw saw the canting jibs when young,
      Of saintly, sulky misery;
   Yet poked aw melancholyâ€™s ribs,
      And said it izant so wiâ€™ me.

   Though monny a stone when aw was young,
      His strong upon me memory;
   Aw thru when young and hed um flung,
      If they forgive â€™tis so wiâ€™ me.

   Could money buy oâ€™ Natureâ€™s mart,
      Again our brightest days to see;
   Therâ€™s monny a wun wod pawn ther shirt,
      Or else theyâ€™d buyâ€”and so wi me.

   Yet after all aw oft luke back,
      Without a pang oâ€™ days gone past,
   An hope all tâ€™ wreng aw did when young,
      May be forgeen to me at last.




Ode to an Herring.


   Wee silvery fish, who nobly braves
   The dangers oâ€™ the ocean waves,
   While monsters from the unknown caves
         Make thee their prey;
   Escaping which the human knaves
         On thee ligs way.

   No doubt thou was at first designed
   To suit the palates oâ€™ mankind;
   Yet as I ponder now I find,
         Thy fame is gone:
   With dainty dish thouâ€™rt behind
         With every one.

   Iâ€™ve seen the time thy silvery sheen
   Were welcome both at morn and eâ€™en,
   Or any hour thatâ€™s in between,
         Thy name wer good;
   But now by some considered mean
         For human food.

   When peace and plentyâ€™s smiling brow,
   And trade and commerce speeds the plough;
   Thy friends that were not long ago,
         Such game they make;
   Thy epitaph is soldier now,
         Or two-eyed snake.

   When times are hard weâ€™re scant oâ€™ cash,
   And famine hungry bellies lash,
   And tripes and trollabobbleâ€™s trash
         Begins to fail,
   Asteead oâ€™ soups anâ€™ oxtail ash,
         Hail! herring, hail!

   Full mony a time tâ€™as made me groan,
   To see thee stretched, despised, alone;
   While turned-up noses passed have gone,
         Oâ€™ purse-proud men!
   No friends, alas! save some poor one
         Fra tâ€™ paddin can.

   Whoeâ€™er despise thee, let them know
   The time may come when they may go
   To some fish wife, and beg to know
         If they can buy
   The friendship oâ€™ their vanquished foe,
         We weeping eye.

   To me nought could be better fun,
   Than see a duke or noble don,
   Or lord, or peer, or gentleman,
         In search oâ€™ thee:
   And they were bidden to move on,
         Or go tâ€™at sea.

   Yet I will sing thy praise, wee fish;
   To me thou art a dainty dish;
   For thee, â€™tis true, we often wish,
         My little bloater;
   Either salted, cured, or shining fresh
         Fra yon great water.

   If through thy pedigree we peep,
   Philosophy from thee can keep,
   To me I need not study deep,
         Thereâ€™s nothing foreign;
   For aw like thee, am sold too cheap,
         My little herring.




Our Poor Little Factory Girls.


   They are up in the morning right early,
      They are up sometimes afore leet;
   Aw hear their clogs they are clamping,
      As tâ€™ little things goes dahn the street.

   They are off in the morning right early,
      With their baskets oâ€™ jock on their arms;
   The bell is ting-tonging, ting-tonging,
      As they enter the mill in a swarm.

   They are skarpring backward and forward,
      Their ends to keep up if they can;
   They are doing their utmost endeavours,
      For fear oâ€™ the frown oâ€™ man.

   Wiâ€™ fingers so nimble and supple,
      They twist, anâ€™ they twine, anâ€™ they twirl,
   Such walking, anâ€™ running, anâ€™ kneeling,
      As the wee little factory girl.

   They are bouncing abaht like a shuttle,
      They are kneeling anâ€™ rubbing the floor;
   While their wee little mates they are doffing,
      Preparing the spindles for more.

   Them two little things they are thickest,
      They help one another â€™tis plain;
   They try to be best and the quickest,
      The smiles oâ€™ their master to gain.

   And now from her ten hoursâ€™ labour,
      Back to her cottage sho shogs;
   Aw hear by the tramping and singing,
      â€™Tis the factory girl in her clogs.

   Anâ€™ at night when shoâ€™s folded iâ€™ slumber,
      Shoâ€™s dreaming oâ€™ noises and drawls;
   Of all human toil under-rated,
      â€™Tis our poor little factory girls.




We Him haw call my awn.


   The branches oâ€™ the woodbine hide
      My little cottage wall,
   Anâ€™ though â€™tis but a humble thatch,
      Aw envy not the hall.

   The wooded hills before my eyes
      Are spread both far and wide;
   Anâ€™ Natureâ€™s grandeur seems to dress,
      In all her lovely pride.

   It is, indeed, a lovely spot,
      Oâ€™ singing birds anâ€™ flowers;
   â€™Mid Natureâ€™s grandeur it is true,
      I pass away my hours.

   Yet think not â€™tis this lovely glen,
      So dear in all its charms;
   Its blossomed banks and rippled reels,
      Freed from the worldâ€™s alarms.

   For should loveâ€™s magic change the scene,
      To trackless lands unknown;
   â€™Twor Eden in the desert wild,
      Wi him aw call my own.

      A small cheese and a barrel oâ€™ beer;
   Awâ€™ll welcome King Christmas to neet,

      And tell him to send up a log;
   Anâ€™ tell him and Betty to come,
      For Tommyâ€™s a jolly oud dog.

   Aw mean to forget all my debts,
      Anâ€™ aw mean to harbour no greef;
   Nobbut emptying glasses anâ€™ plates
      Oâ€™ their contents oâ€™ beer and gooid beef.

   Them barns they care nought abaht drink,
      Like us atâ€™s advanced into years;

   And may every poor crater ta neet,
      If never before in his loife,
   Have plenty to drink anâ€™ ta eat,
      For both him, anâ€™ his barns, anâ€™ his woife.




The Fethered Captive.


   My little dappled-wingged fellow,
   What ruffinâ€™s hand has made thee wellow?
   Haw heard while down in yonder hollow,
         Thy troubled breast;
   But Iâ€™ll return my little fellow,
         Back to its nest.

   Some ruffinâ€™s hand has set a snickle,
   And left thee in a bonny pickle;
   Who eâ€™er he be, haw hope old Nick â€™al
         Rise his arm,
   And mak his heead anâ€™ ear-hoil tickle
         We summat warm.

   How glad am aw that fate while roaming,
   Where milk-white Hawthornsâ€™ blossoms blooming,
   As sent me footsteps ere the gloaming
         Into this dell.
   To stop some murdering hand fra drowning
         Thy bonny sell.

   For thou wert doomed, my bird, for ever,
   Fra all thy fethered mates to sever;
   Were aw not near thee to deliver
         We my awn hand;
   Nor never more thouâ€™d skim the river,
         Or fellowed land.

   Thy fetherd friends, if thou has onny;
   Thoâ€™ friends aw fear there izant mony;
   But yet thy dam for her, we Johnny,
         Will fret to-day.
   And think her watter-wagtail bonny
         Has flown away.

   Be not afraid, for net a fether
   Fra of thy wing shall touch the hether,
   For I will give thee altogether
         Sweet liberty!
   And glad am aw that aw came hither,
         To set thee free.

   Now wing thy flight my little rover,
   Thy cursed captivity is over,
   And if thou crosses tâ€™ Straits oâ€™ Dover
         To warmer spheres;
   Hoping thou may live in clover,
         For years and years.

   Happily, like thee, for fortuneâ€™s fickle,
   I may, myself, be caught it snickle;
   And some kind hand that sees my pickle
         Through saving thee,
   May snatch me, too, fra deathâ€™s grim shackle,
         And set me free.




Trip to Malsis Hall.


   The day wor fine, the sun did shine,
      No sines oâ€™ rain to fall,
   When tâ€™North Beck hands, e jovial bands,
      Did visit Malsis Hall.

   Up by the hill oâ€™ North Beck Mill,
      Both ould anâ€™ young did meet;
   To march I trow, e two-by-two,
      E processhun dahn the street.

   Anâ€™ Marrinerâ€™s Band, we music grand,
      Struck up wi all ther might;
   Then one and all, both great and small,
      Marchâ€™d on we great delight.

   The girls and boys, we jovial noise,
      The fife and drum did play;
   For every one would have some fun
      On this eventful day.

   Oud Joan oâ€™ Sall wiâ€™ all his palls,
      Marched on wiâ€™ all ther ease;
   Just for a lark, some did remark,
      There goes some prime oud cheese!

   The Exlaheead chaps wi their girt caps,
      Anâ€™ coits nut quite iâ€™thâ€™ fashion;
   With arms ding-dong, they stretch along,
      Anâ€™ put a fineish dash on.

   Tom Wilkin drest up in his best,
      Tâ€™ oud wife put on her fall,
   For they wor bent, what come or went,
      To dine at Malsis Hall.

   There wor Tommy Twist, among the list,
      We his magenta snaat;
   Hez often said, sin he gat wed,
      Tâ€™ oud lass sud hev an aht.

   Amongst the lot wor oud Sam Butt,
      As fine as oud Lord Digby;
   Anâ€™ oud Queer Doos, wiâ€™ his strait shoos,
      Anâ€™ wiâ€™ him Joseph Rigby.

   Thereâ€™s Jimmy Gill, oâ€™ Castle hill,â€”
      That gentleman wiâ€™t stick,â€”
   Thereâ€™s Will anâ€™ Sam, and young John Lamb,
      Anâ€™ Ben anâ€™ Earby Dick.

   Aw scorn to lieâ€”the reason why
      It is a shame awm sure!
   But among the gob, wiâ€™ old Joe Hob,
      Behould a perfect cure.

   Iâ€™d quite forgot, among the lot,
      There was old Pally Pickles,
   Wiâ€™ crinoline sho walks so fine,
      Shoâ€™s like a cat e prickles.

   Bud to me tale, aw musant fail
      Fer out on this occasion;
   We heead erect, and girt respect,
      We march to Keighley Station.

   And Maud anâ€™ tâ€™ woife, az large az life,
      Gat inâ€™t train together;
   They both did say, theyâ€™d have a day,
      Among the blooming hether.

   Nahâ€”all fane gat in tâ€™ train,
      And Ned began to scream;
   Then Master Pratt doft off his hat,
      Anâ€™ pept aht at the steeam.

   This jovial band, when they did land,
      Got off the train so hearty,
   For they all went, wiâ€™ that intent,
      To have a grand tea-party!

   The country folk did gape anâ€™ luke,
      To see us all delighted,
   For every one, did say begum,
      Aw wish Iâ€™d been invited.

   Its joy to tell, they march as well
      As the Scots did ower the border,
   Ould Wellington and all his men
      Neâ€™er saw such marching order.

   The lookers on, to see them come,
      Get on the second story;
   Right down the park they did the mark,
      Coming e full glory.

   Then to the place, each smiling face,
      Move on in grand succession;
   The lookers on did say â€œwell done,
      It iz a grand processhun!â€

   When theyâ€™d all past the hall at last,
      They formâ€™d into a column;
   Then Jimmy Wreet, wiâ€™ all hiz meet,
      Gave aht a hymn so solemn:

   Then all did raise their voice in praise,
      We music in the centre;
   They sang a hymn e praise oâ€™ Him,
      At iz the girt inventer.

   That bit being done, they all did run,
      To have a pleasant day in,
   Some went there, anâ€™ some went here,
      Anâ€™ tâ€™ Bands began oâ€™ playing.

   We mich amaze, we all did gaze,
      Around this splendid park;
   Then little Jake began to speak,
      Anâ€™ thus he did remark:â€”

   â€œAt Morecambe Bay awâ€™ve been a day,
      At Bolton Woods anâ€™ Ilkley;
   But Malsis Hall outstrip them all,
      At awâ€™ve seen aht oâ€™ Keighley.â€

   The girt park wall around the hall,
      Majestically does stand;
   The waving trees, an pleasant breeze,
      Its loike a fairy land.

   It fillâ€™d wer eyes, we great surprise,
      To see the fountain sporting;
   Anâ€™ on the top, stuck on a pot,
      The British flags wor floating.

   The walks so grand, wiâ€™ yellow sand,
      Anâ€™ splendid wor the paving,
   High over all, around the wall,
      Wor flags anâ€™ banners waving.

   Nah some made fun, anâ€™ some did run,
      And women they wor swinging;
   Do you ken the â€œMuffin Man,â€â€”
      Others they wor singing.

   In sooth wor grand, to see this band,
      Assemble all together;
   Bud sad to say, that varry day,
      Turned aht some shocking weather.

   Even war nert rain, aw mun explain,
      At caused a girt disaster,
   All but one sort oâ€™ breead ran short,
      It wor no fault oâ€™ tâ€™ master.

   O! Gormanton! thy bread anâ€™ bun,
      Anâ€™ judgment it wor scanty;
   Oh! what a shame, anâ€™ what a name,
      For not providing plenty!

   Oh, silly clown! thou might have known
      To eyt each one wor able;
   The country air did mack some swear,
      They could ommost eyt a table.

   The atmosphere, no longer clear,
      The clouds are black anâ€™ stormy;
   Then all but one away did run,
      Like some deserting army.

   Onâ€”on! they go! as if some foe
      Wor charging at the lot!
   If they got there, they didnâ€™t care
      A fig for poor Will Scott!

   Poor lame ould Will, remains there still,
      His crutches has to fetch him;
   But heâ€™s seen the toime, when in his prime,
      At nobody there could catch him.

   Like some fast steed, wiâ€™ all its speed,
      All seemâ€™d as they wor flying;
   To escape the rain, anâ€™ catch the train,
      Both old and young wor trying.

   One neet, old Wills, about Crosshills,
      He heeard a fearful humming,
   He said tâ€™ woife, upon my life,
      Aw think the French are coming!

   Tha knaws reight weel at weâ€™ve heeard tell
      O sich strange things before,
   So lass look quick, anâ€™ cut thee stick,
      Anâ€™ a will bolt the door.

   Like drahnded rats, they pass their mates,
      Anâ€™ rans dahn to the station;
   And Betty Bakes anâ€™ Sally Shakes,
      Their both plump aht oâ€™ patience.

   â€œThis is a mess,â€ says little Bess,
      At lives oâ€™t top oâ€™t garden;
   â€œThereâ€™s my new shawl anâ€™ fine lace fall,
      Theyâ€™ll nut be worth a farden.â€

   But, hark! ding-dong goes through the throng,
      The bell does give the sign,
   With all its force, the iron horse,
      Comes trotting up the line.

   Then one by one they all get on,
      Wet, fatigued and weary;
   The steam does blow, old Ned doth go,
      And we come back so cheery.

   All satisfied we their short rideâ€”
      But sorry for the rainâ€”
   Each thenkt ther stars theyâ€™re nowt no war,
      Anâ€™ weâ€™ve got home again.

   Wheneâ€™er we roam away from home,
      No matter where or when,
   In storm or shower, if in wer power,
      To homeâ€”sweet home, return!

   What we had seenâ€”where we had beenâ€”
      Each to our friend wor telling:
   The day being spent, we homeward went
      To each respective dwelling.




Dame Europeâ€™s Lodging House.


   Dame Europa kept a Lodging House,
      And she was fond of brass;
   She took in public lodgers,
      Of every rank and class.

   Sheâ€™d French and Germans, Dutch and Swiss,
      And other nations too;
   So poor old Mrs. Europe
      Had plenty work to do.

   I cannot just now name her beds,
      Her number being so large;
   But five she kept for deputies,
      Which she had in her charge.

   So in this famous Lodging house,
      John Bull he stood A ONE,
   On whom she always kept an eye,
      To see things rightly done.

   And Master Louis was her next,
      And second, thereâ€™s no doubt,
   For when a little row took place,
      He always backed John out.

   For in her house was Alex Russ,
      Oft him they eyâ€™d with fear;
   For Alex was a lazy hound,
      And kept a Russian Bear.

   Her fourth was a man of grace,
      And was for heaven bent;
   His name was Pious William,
      Guided by his testament.

   Her fifth, too, was a pious Knave,
      And â€™tis our firm belief,
   He once did rob the Hungary Lads
      Of their honest bread and beef.

   These were Dame Europeâ€™s deputies,
      In whom she put her trust,
   To keep her lodging house at peace,
      In case eruption burst.

   For many a time a row took place,
      While sharing out the scran;
   But John and Louis soon steppâ€™d in,
      And cleared the _padding can_.

   Once Alex Russâ€™s father Nick,
      A bit before he died,
   Seized a little Turk one day,
      And thought to warm his hide.

   But John and Louis soon steppâ€™d in,
      Declaring it foul play;
   And made old Nick remember it
      Until his dying day.

   Now all Dame Europeâ€™s deputies,
      They made themselves at home;
   And every lodger knew his bed,
      Likewise his sitting room.

   They took great interest in their beds,
      And kept them very clean;
   Unlike some other padding cans,
      So dirty and so mean.

   But Louis had the nicest bed,
      Of any of the lot;
   And being close by a window,
      He loved a flower pot.

   The best and choicest bed of all,
      Was occupied with Johnny;
   Because the Dame did favour him,
      He did collect her money.

   And in a little bunk he lived,
      Sealâ€™d up with oak, and tarrâ€™d;
   He would not let a single one,
      Come near within a yard.

   A Jack of all trades, too, was John,
      And aught heâ€™d do for brass;
   And what he ever took in hand,
      No one could him surpass.

   When tired of being shut up it bunk,
      Sometimes he went across,
   To spend an hour with Master Louis,
      And they the wine would toss.

   So many a happy day they spent,
      These lads, with one another;
   While every lodger in the house,
      Thought John was Louisâ€™ brother.

   The Dame allowed John something nice,
      To get well in her rent,
   Which every now and then it bank,
      He put it on per cent.

   And working very hard himself
      Amongst his tar and pitch;
   He soon accumulated wealth,
      That made him very rich.

   The next to Louisâ€™ bed was Will,
      The biggest Monitor;
   And though he did pretend a saint,
      He was as big a cur.

   He loved to make them all believe
      He was opposed to strife,
   And said he never caused a row,
      No, never in his life.

   He was so fond of singing psalms,
      And read his testament;
   So everybody was deceived
      When he was on mischief bent.

   He seldom passed a lodgerâ€™s bed
      But what he took a glance,
   Which made them every one suspect
      Heâ€™d rob them if heâ€™d chance.

   Now Louis had two flower pots
      He nourished with much care,
   But little knew that Willieâ€™s eyes
      Were set upon the pair.

   In one there grew an ALSACE Rose,
      The other a LORAINE,
   And Willie vowed they once were his
      And must be his again.

   He said his father once lodgâ€™d there,
      And that the dame did know
   That Louis predecessors once
      Had sneaked them in a row.

   But in Willieâ€™s council was a lad
      Up to every quirk,
   To keep him out of mischief, long
      Dame Europe had her work.

   To this smart youth Saint Willie
      Did whisper his desire
   One night as they sat smoking,
      Besides the kitchen fire.

   To get them flowers back again,
      Said Bissy, very low,
   Meet Louis somewhere on the quiet,
      And try to cause a row.

   But mind the other deputies
      Donâ€™t catch you on the hop,
   For John and Joseph you must know
      Your little game would stop.

   For Joseph he has not forgot
      The day you warmed his rig;
   And christian Denmark still thinks on
      About his nice Slesvig.

   By your advice, my own Dear Mark,
      I have been guided on,
   But what about that man iâ€™t bunk?
      Pointing oâ€™er to John.

   Heâ€™s very plucky too is John,
      But yet heâ€™s very slow,
   And perhaps he never may perceive
      Our scheme about the row.

   But not another word of this
      To anybodyâ€™s ears,
   The dame she plays the listâ€™ner,
      I have my doubts and fears.

   So let us go up-stairs at once,
      I think it will be best,
   And let us pray to Him above,
      Before we go to rest.

   So with a pious countenance,
      His prayers as usual said,
   But squinting round the room the while,
      He spied an empty bed.

   What a pity that these empty stocks
      Should be unoccupied;
   Do you think my little cousin, Mark,
      To them could be denied.

   â€™Tis just the very thing, said Mark,
      Your cousin, sir, and you,
   Would carry out my scheme first-rate,
      One at each side of Lue.

   The dame being asked did not object
      If he could pay the rent,
   And had a decent characterz
      And Louis would consent.

   But I do object to this says Lue,
      And on this very ground,
   Willy and his cousins, maâ€™am,
      They soon will me surround.

   Theyâ€™re nothing in my line at all
      They are so near a-kin,
   And so if I consent to this
      At once theyâ€™ll hem me in.

   O, you couldnâ€™t think it, Master Lue,
      That I should do you harm,
   For donâ€™t I read my testament
      And donâ€™t I sing my psalm.

   â€™Tis all my eye, said Louis, both
      Your testament and psalms;
   You use the dumbbells regular
      To strengthen up your arms.

   So take your poor relation off,
      You pious-looking prig,
   And open out Kit Denmarkâ€™s box,
      And give him back Slesvig.

   Come, come, says Mrs. Europe,
      Letâ€™s have no bother here,
   Your trying now to breed a row
      At least it does appear.

   Now Johnny hearing from the bunk
      What both of them did say,
   He shouted out, Now stop it, Will,
      Or else youâ€™ll rue the day.

   All right friend John, Iâ€™m much obliged,
      You are my friend, I know,
   And so my little cousin, sir,
      Iâ€™m willing to withdraw.

   But Louis frothed at mouth with rage,
      Like one that was insane,
   And said heâ€™d make Bill promise him
      Heâ€™d not offend again.

   Iâ€™d promise no such thing, says Mark,
      For that would hurt your pride,
   Sing on and read your testament,
      Dame Europeâ€™s on your side.

   If Iâ€™d to promise out at sort,
      â€™Twould be against my mind;
   So take it right or take it wrong,
      Iâ€™ll promise naught at kind.

   Then I shall take and wallop thee
      Unless thou cuts thy stick,
   And drive thee to thy fatherland
      Before another week.

   Come on, cried Sanctimonius,
      And sending out his arm
   He caught poor Louis on the nose,
      Then sung another psalm.

   But Louis soon was on his pins,
      And used his fists a bit,
   But he was fairly out of breath,
      And seldom ever hit.

   And at the end of round the first,
      He got it fearful hot,
   This was his baptism of fire
      If we mistake it not.

   So Willy sent a letter home,
      To his mother, old Augusta,
   Telling her heâ€™d thrashed poor Lue,
      And given him such a duster.

   What wonderful events, says he,
     Has heaven brought about,
   I fight the greatest pugilist
      That ever was brought out.

   And if by divine Providence
      I get safe through this row,
   Then I will sing â€œMy God the spring
      From whom all blessings flow.â€

   Meanwhile the other Monitors,
      Were standing looking on,
   But none of them durst speak a word,
      But all stared straight at John.

   Ought not I to interfere,
      Says Johnny to the rest,
   But he was told by every one
      Neutrality was the best.

   Neutral, growlâ€™d John, I hate the name,
      â€™Tis poison to my ear,
   Itâ€™s another word for cowardice,
      And makes me fit to swear.

   At any rate I can do this,
      My mind I will not mask,
   Iâ€™ll give poor Lue a little drop
      Out of my brandy flask.

   And give it up, poor Lue, my lad,
      You might as well give in,
   You know that I have got no power,
      Besides you did begin.

   Then Louis rose, and looked at John,
      And spoke of days gone by,
   When he would not have seen his friend,
      Have blackened Johnnyâ€™s eye.

   And as for giving in, friend John,
      Iâ€™ll do nothing of the sort;
   Do you think Iâ€™ll be a laughing stock
      For everybodyâ€™s sport.

   This conversation that took place
      Made pious Willy grin,
   And told John Bull to hold his noise,
      â€™Twas nought to do with him.

   These words to John did make him stare,
      And, finding to his shame,
   That them were worse that did look on,
      Than them that played the game.

   Now Dame Europe knew the facts
      Which had been going on,
   And with her usual dignity,
      These words addressed to John:

   Now, Mr. Bull, pray answer me,â€”
      Why are you gaping here?
   You are my famous deputy,
      Then why not interfere?

   Why, answered John, and made a bow,
      But yet was very shy;
   I was told to be a neutral, maâ€™am,
      And thatâ€™s the reason why.

   Thatâ€™s just what you should not have done,
      Being in authority;
   Did I not place you in that bunk
      To think and act for me?

   Why any baby in the house
      Could not have done much worse,
   But I fancy youâ€™ve been holding back
      To save your private purse.

   Neutrality is as fine a word
      As ever a coward used,
   So the honour that I gave to you
      You shouldnâ€™t have abused.

   The minor lodgers in the house,
      On hearing this to John,
   Began to whisper and to laugh,
      And callâ€™d it famous fun.

   At last a little urchin said,
      Please maâ€™am Iâ€™d take my oath,
   At master John were neutral,
      And stuck up for them both.

   Stuck up for both, offended both,â€”
      Is that it what you mean?
   Continued Madame Europe,
      Then spoke to John again:

   Now Iâ€™ll tell you what it is, John,
      Weâ€™ve long watchâ€™d your career,
   You take your fagâ€™s advice to save
      Your paltry sums a year.

   Thereâ€™s Bob and Bill, besides some more
      That I call naught but scums,
   Theyâ€™ve got you fairly in between
      Their fingers and their thumbs.

   If such like men as Ben and Hugh
      This day your fags had been,
   They would have saved both you and me
      The cursed disgraceful scene.

   And instead of being half-clad and shod,
      As everybody knows,
   You would have dared these rivals now
      To come to such like blows.

   There was a time in this house, John,
      If you put up your thumb,
   The greatest blackguard tongue would stop
      As if they had been dumb.

   But not a one iâ€™t house
      This moment cares a fig,
   For all you say or all you do,
      Although your purse be big.

   I couldnâ€™t hurt poor Louis, maâ€™am,
      Although he did begin;
   And then you see that Will and I
      Are very near akin.

   Beside, you see, said John again,
      I let poor Louis sup,
   On both I use my ointment, and
      Their wounds I did bind up.

   A weel a day then said the dame,
      But much affected were,
   I see you have some small excuse
      What you have done it for.

   I have some little hopes left yet
      That you may yet have sense,
   To know your high position, John,
      Instead of saving pence.

   You yet will learn that duty, sir,
      Cannot be ignored,
   However disagreeable when
      Placed before the board.

   And let me tell you he who shirks
      The responsibility
   Of seeing right, is doing wrong,
      And deserves humility.

   And â€™tis an empty-headed dream,
      To boast of skill and power,
   And dare not even interfere
      At the latest hour.

   Better far confess at once
      Youâ€™re not fit for your place,
   Than have a name Heroic, sir,
      Branded with disgrace.

   But I will not say another word,
      My deputies, to you;
   But hope you will a warning take,
      This moment from poor Lue.

   And hoping, John, your enemies
      May never have the chance
   To see you paid for watching Will
      Thrash poor weak Louis France.




The Bould Bucaneers:


                   A MILITARY DESCRIPTION OF THE SECOND
                        EXCURSION TO MALSIS HALL,
                    THE RESIDENCE OF JAMES LUND, ESQ.

   I remember perusing when I was a boy,
   The immortal bardâ€”Homerâ€™s siege of old Troy;
   So the Malsis encampment Iâ€™ll sing if you will,
   How our brave army bivouced on the plains oâ€™ Park hill.

   Near the grand Hall oâ€™ Malsis our quarters we toke,
   When Lieutenant-col. Don Frederick spoke,
   Commanding his aide-camp Colonel de Mann,
   To summons and muster the chiefs oâ€™ the clan.

   Majors Wood, Lamb, and Pollard came up to the lines,
   Each marching their companies up to the nines;
   The twirlers anâ€™ twisters the knights oâ€™ the coil,
   Anâ€™ spuzzers anâ€™ sorters fell in at the roll.

   The light-infantry captains wer Robin and Shack,
   And the gallant big benners the victuals did sack;
   Captain Green he commanded the Indigo troop,
   These Beer Barrel chargers none with them can cope.

   The amazon army led on by Queen Bess,
   Each feminine soldier so grand was her dress,
   Though they chatted and pratted, twor pleasant to see
   Them laughing and quaffing their hot rum anâ€™ tea.

   There wor music to dainties and music to wine,
   Anâ€™ for faar oâ€™ invaders no hearts did repine;
   Although a dark cloud swept over the plain,
   Yet our quarter wor sheltered from famine anâ€™ rain.

   Drum-Major Ben Rushworth and Bandmaster Master Wright,
   Drank to each other wiâ€™ pleasure that night;
   Weâ€™d full-flowing bumpers, weâ€™d music an fun,
   From the larder anâ€™ cellar oâ€™ Field-Marshall Lund.

   Private Tom Berry got into the hall,
   When a big rump oâ€™ beef he made rather small;
   Anâ€™ Flintergill Billy oâ€™ the Spuzzerâ€™s Brigade,
   Got his beak in the barrel, anâ€™ havock he made.

   The Field Marshall declared and his good lady too,
   They neâ€™er was attacked wiâ€™ so pleasant a foe;
   With this all the clansmen gave them three cheers,
   In return they saluted the bold Bucaneers.




The Veteran.


   I left yond fields so fair to view;
      I left yond mountain pass and peaks;
   I left two een so bonny blue,
      A dimpled chin and rosy cheeks.
   For an helmet gay and suit oâ€™ red
      I did exchange my corduroy;
   I mind the words the Sergeant said,
      When I in sooth was but a boy.

   Come, rouse thee, lad, be not afraid;
      Come, join and be a brave dragoon:
   Youâ€™ll be well clothed, well kept, well paid,
      Anâ€™ captain be promoted soon.
   Your sweetheart, too, will smile to see
      Your manly form anâ€™ dress so fine;
   Then geaâ€™s your hand anâ€™ follow me,â€”
      Our troopâ€™s the finest in the line.

   The pyramids behold our corps
      Drive back the mighty man oâ€™ Fate!
   Our ire is felt on every shore,
      In every country, clime, or state.
   The Cuirassers at Waterloo
      We crushed;â€”they wor the pride oâ€™ France!
   At Inkerman, wiâ€™ sabre true,
      We broke the Russ and Cossack lance!

   Then come, my lad, extend your hand,
      Thine indolence I hold it mean;
   Now follow me, at the command,
      Of our most gracious Sovereign Queen?
   A prancing steed youâ€™ll have to ride;
      A bonny plume will deck your brow;
   Wiâ€™ clinking spurs anâ€™ sword beside,â€”
      Come? hereâ€™s the shilling: take it now!

   The loyal pledge I took and gave,â€”
      It was not for the silver coin;
   I wish to cross the briny wave,
      Anâ€™ Englandâ€™s gallant sons to join.
   Sinceâ€”many a summerâ€™s sun has set,
      Anâ€™ timeâ€™s graved-scar is on my brow,
   Yet I am free and willing yet
      To meet ould Englandâ€™s daring foe.




The Vale of Aire.


[It was early in the morning that I took my ramble.  I had noticed but
little until I arrived at the foot of the quaint old hamlet of Marley.
My spirits began to be cheered, for lively gratitude glowed in my heart
at the wild romantic scenery before me.  Passing the old mansion house, I
wended my way towards the huge crag called the â€œAltar Rock.â€  Wild and
rugged as the scenery was, it furnished an agreeable entertainment to my
mind, and with pleasure I pushed my way to the top of the gigantic rock,
where I viewed the grandeur of the vale below.  The blossom on the
branches, the crooked Aire gliding along like sheets of polished crystal,
made me poetic.  I thought of Nicholson, the poet of this beautiful vale,
and reclining on a green moss covered bank, I said these words.]

   Poet Nicholson, old Eborâ€™s darling bard,
      Accept from me at least one tributary line;
   Yet how much more should be thy just reward,
      Than any wild unpolished song of mine.

   No monument in marble can I raise,
      Or sculptured bust in honour of thy name;
   But humbly try to celebrate thy praise,
      And give thee that applause thou shouldst duly claim.

   All hail, the songsters that awake the morn,
      And soothe the soul with wild melodious strains;
   All hail, the rocks that Bingley hills adorn,
      Beneath whose shades wild natureâ€™s grandeur reigns.

   From off yon rock that rears its head so high,
      And overlooks the crooked river Aire;
   While musing natureâ€™s works full meet thy eye,
      The envied game, the lark and timid hare.

   In Goitstock falls, and rugged Marley hills,
      In Bingleyâ€™s grand and quiet sequesterâ€™d dale,
   Each silvery stream, each dike or rippled rills,
      I see thy haunt and read thy â€œPoacherâ€™s Tale.â€

   So, Homer like, thy harp was wont to tune,
      Thy native vale and glorious days of old,
   Whose maidens fair in virtuous beauty shone,
      Her sages and her heroes great and bold.

   No flattering baseness could employ thy mind,
      The free-born muse detests that servile part:
   In simple lore thy self-taught lay I find
      More grandeur far than all the gloss of art.

   Though small regard be paid to worth so rare,
      And humble worth unheeded pass along;
   Ages to come will sing the â€œVale of Aire,â€
      Her Nicholson and his historic song.




The Pauperâ€™s Box.


   Thou odious box, as I look on thee,
   I wonder wilt thou be unlocked for me?
   No, no! forbear!â€”yet then, yet then,
   â€™Neath thy grim lid lie the menâ€”
   Men whom fortuneâ€™s blasted arrows hit,
   And send them to the pauperâ€™s pit.

   O, dig a grave somewhere for me,
   Deep, underneath some witherâ€™d tree;
   Or bury me on the wildest heath,
   Where Boreas blows his wildest breath,
   Or â€™mid some wild romantic rocks:
   But, oh! forbear the pauperâ€™s box.

   Throw me into the ocean deep,
   Where many poor forgotten sleep;
   Or fling my corpse in the battle mound,
   With coffinless thousands â€™neath the ground;
   I envy not the mightiest dome,
   But save me from a pauperâ€™s tomb.

   I care not if â€™twere the wild wolfâ€™s glen,
   Or the prison yard, with wicked men;
   Or into some filthy dung-hole hurledâ€”
   Anywhere, anywhere! out of the world!
   In fire, or smoke, on land, or sea,
   Than thy grim lid be closed on me.

   But let me pause, ere I say more
   About thee, unoffending door;
   When I bethink me, now I pause,
   It is not thee who makes the laws,
   But villains who, if all were just,
   In thy grim cell would lay their dust.

   But yet, â€™twere grand beneath yond wall,
   To lay with friends,â€”relations all;
   If sculptured tombstones were never there,
   But simple grass with daisies fair;
   And were it not, grim box, for thee
   â€™Twere paradise, O cemetery.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
