    APOLOGY


    While blue and khaki share the heroes mud,
    And women tend in white or weep in grey,
    Though all expressiveness seems over-dressed,
    Yet some must wear the colours of their hearts
    Upon their sleeves, like troubadours, of old;
    And sing, and sometimes write their singing down.

    ... To "chase them from republics" were as vain
    As to disturb the hurdy-gurdy man.
    Let him go grinding music as he likes;
    You see him turn his wheel, but need not hear
    The tune he's playing in the noisy street?...

    (Some have an organ, some an axe to grind,
    While others seek how best to bury hatchets.)
    We all are poets in our different ways
    And may your dreams be harmless as my own.






    AH! NIGHT!


    Ah! night!
    To feel the stab of beauty at the heart!
    To drink, with lifted throat,
    The silent throb and music of the stars,
    The first kiss of the spring on spell-bound trees,
    To stretch out arms to hold and soothe the world,
    --A love too vast in aught to be contained,
    Helpless and great: a poets youthfulness,...

    Alone, might all this emptiness be you!

                              _May first 1915_






    THE LOVE OF JUDAS


    Love, take me back to you, and make me whole,
    Who am divided and in unbelief:
    An infidel in thought and word and grief,
    A double heart and a promiscuous soul!

    And what if Judas offered Christ that bowl
    Of greatest bitterness without relief.
    Revenge, not silver, tempted such a thief:
    Betrayed betrayer of the kiss he stole.

    He loved the most; those others loved but well,
    They drowsed: in dreadful paths his anguish trod,
    Nor thrice denied the love that sold his God.

    No pity for his throbbing jealous side,
    No pity for his false obscure farewell;
    Yet he alone for his lost master died!






    THE WEEPING VENUS


    by Romaine


    Laid out as dead in moonlight shroud
    Beneath a derelict of cloud:
    A double wreckage safe from flight,
    High-caged as grief, in prisoned night.--
    Unseeing eyes whose clustering tears
    Tell the pure crystal of her years.--
    No crown of thorns, no wounded side,
    Yet as the God-man crucified,
    Her body expiates the sin
    That love and life with her begin!






    MORE NIGHT!


    Moon-love, star-love, the love of silver water.
    The weeping face of love touched in the dark,
    And murdered joy, lost souls of joy that caught her
            A glow-worm's warmth and spark.

    Birds of prey, invisible, now hover
    About her midnights hammocked in unrest--
    A moving shadow, faithless as a lover,
            Is all her arms have pressed--

    Too luminous the dreaming of the sleeper
    Whose tears are prophecies and second-sight.
    Has death no under-sea, no darkness deeper,
            In which to satiate our need of night?






    THE PHANTOM GUEST


    We lay in shade diaphanous
    And spoke the light that burns in us

    As in the glooming's net I caught her,
    She shimmered like reflected water!

    Romantic and emphatic moods
    Are not for her whom life eludes...

    Its vulgar tinsel round her fold?
    She'd rather shudder with the cold,

    Attend just this elusive hour,
    A shadow in a shadow bower,

    A moving imagery so fine,
    It must have been her soul near mine

    And so we blended and possessed
    Each in each the phantom guest,

    Inseparate, we scarcely met;
    Yet other love-nights we forget!






    DOUBLE BEING


    A northern mind, a face from Italy,
    A double fate lived all too fatally,
    A look fresh as a childs, both soft and sharp,
    A clarion-voice, then liquid as a harp!
    A natural being, yet from nature freed,
    Like a Shakespearean boy of fairy breed--
    A sex perplexed into attractive seeming--
    Both sex at best, the strangeness so redeeming!--
    Hands hard to loosen if for once they cling,
    Yet frail as Leicester's wearing a queen's ring.
    A page-clothed Rosalind to play a part,
    A brow of genius and a lonely heart.






    SINGING


    Ethereal vibrations
    And soulful pulsations
        Of song,
    Afloat on the air
    --More aspiring than prayer--
        How strong
    The wings that uplift!
    As soaring adrift,
        A throng
    Of angels there are,
    And an echoing star,
        As along
    You rise ever higher,
    Sole voice of a choir
        How long
    Shall we follow your flight,
    Through crystaline night,
        And belong
    --Through the high vaults of space--
    To your archangel's face,
        And long,
    --With the heavens still ringing--
    To be one with your singing?






    ON A PICTURE TO MUSIC


    Music, language of the mortal soul.
            The face of twilight,
    The mouth of bitterness made lyrical,
    Eyes closed on poignant joys that might have been!
    A profile turned to life, and yet beyond ...
    Reborn, transfigured; penetrating sense
            To gather an acute expressiveness
    Vibrant within itself: all our lost lives!
    --We must play gently to the living dead--
    Fingers outstretched, by that responsive lid
    Where Angel harps lie buried at full length,
    Yet still in touch and resonant--Arise
            To laying on of hands--
    Invisible, a phantom of pure sound
    Voices the spirit sitting there, awakes
    The sighing, and the soaring and the beat
    (O dispossessed and silenced King: my heart!)
    Until we too are echos of that tide,
    Where winds and waves become articulate,
    Our being tossed so high, beyond itself,
          Winged by the elements!
    Our human weight of woe no longer felt
                Until we meet
    --By some familiar fall of minor chords--
    The inner God of Sorrow face to face.






    LOVE'S COMRADES


    You say I've lived too long in France
    And wearied of the senses' dance?


    Like fresh air in an opium den
    You'll lead me out--to where? and when?


    .... I fear no country's ready yet
    For our complexities: forget
    The best of flesh and food to go
    A'roaming o'er the world, and know
    Discomfort's great surprises few--?
    No, let me travel just to you!






    WITH TWO DWARF JAPANESE MAPLES


    These ancient trees for your new room.
    May many happy evenings fall
    With their reflections on the wall,
    Making embroideries of the gloom,
    And let their leaves of red and green
    Rustle with small desires and fears,
    But never water them with tears
    For all that is or has not been.
    Lives pass as shadows on a screen,
    Whether you dream or sing or sew,
    Or if some time Regret instead
    Should bow, my Loveliest, your head,
    Send me a leaf so I shall know:
    For Hope the green, for Love the red.






    AVERTISSEMENT.


    _Her name begins as Love begins,_
    _Mine as "November", "Nevermore"._


    No thousand nights and one between these covers,
    No miniatures, enluminures or dyes--
    For art is but a prostitute that hovers
    To court outsiders--you alone may prize
    These pages which your idle hand unties?--


    ... Leaving art to artists--we, loves lovers,
    Keep for out-worn Beauty a disguise.
    --(A line traced round a shadow as it dies,
    Some semblance of the scattered rose recovers?)--
    So making everything seem otherwise:
    Associations are our deities!
    --And ivy leaves, transparent eggs of plovers
    Are fragments of the feast they symbolize.--


    Here, visible as sleeping Eros, lies
    A book of dreams and broken memories,
    A living past for which blind Love has eyes?






    THE FLUTE-PLAYER


    Her flute's clear solo greets the maiden day--
    Above the waking of melodious May,
    Its notes are like a trellised flight of flowers.

    The chirping birds whose orchestra of bills
    Accompanies rain--the tea-rose best distills--
    And then the smell of earth between the showers!

    From garden bright, in drops of crystal gown'd,
    I hear the breezes make a leafy sound
    Through vibrant buzz of flies that seek the shade--

    ... And wonder whether--as sweet noon reposes--
    The roses make the air, the air the roses
    Within the house kept cooler than a glade.

    Against the wall, upon the sunny side,
    Their fruitful branches fixed and crucified,
    The pear-trees stretch out arms in martyred line--

    While we that surfeit, nap, as calyx'd bees,
    Who murmurs, still pursuing imageries
    ... ¬´Like Jewish candelabras¬ª. (relight mine!)

    Rising as to welcome a newcomer
    The flute pipes to the first eve of the summer
    --Nocturnal nature moves to minor bars--

    A golden crescent in a druid's tree
    Reminds her that the forest has a key--
    And out she goes to serenade the stars!






    A PARISIAN ROOF GARDEN IN 1918


    As I must mount to feed those doves of ours,
    Perhaps you too will spend nocturnal hours
                Upon your roof
                So high aloof
    That from its terraced bowers
    We catch at clouds and draw a bath from showers.
    Before the moon has made all pale the night,
    Let's meet with flute and viol, and supper light:
    A yew lamb, minted sauce, a raisined bun,
    A melon riper than the melting sun--
    A flask of Xeres, that we've scarce begun--
    Well try the ¬´lunar waltz¬ª while floats afar
    Upon the liquid night--night's nenuphar.
    Or else, with senses tuned alike perchance,
    Reclining love will make the heavens dance;
    And if the enemy from aerial cars
    Drops death, we'll share it vibrant with the stars!






    HOW WRITE THE BEAT OF LOVE


    How write the beat of love, the very throb,
    The rhythm of our veins' deep eloquence?
    How fix that darkness-rending final sob,
    That perfect swoon of each united sense.

    The full-sailed rising of your body's sweep
    --Adrift and safe on joy's last tidal wave--
    Will toss you on the silver sands of sleep,
    Forgetful of the ecstacy you gave.

    Your breath ebbs restful as the falling tide:
    A sea becalmed!... Lay me in valleyed part
    Of breasts whose undulating crests subside--
    Ah how they marked the high beats of your heart!






    A LA CAMPAGNE


    The night, whose silences detach each sound,
    The leaves, as whispering heralds in a wood,
    Stir hopes of you about my solitude.
    Was that a carriage wheel upon the ground?
    --The grassy ground that brings the road uphill
    Would muffle horses hoofs--I listen still--
    A nervous motion at my heart: the bound
    Of too responsive veins--a hush profound.

    I hear a night bird call its mate?... a hound
    Out on the farm bark at some peasant maid
    Too tired with harvesting to feel afraid.
    ... Loosed, and now tied, scenting the sunny air,
    All day she combed and tossed the fields' dim hair,
    As some mute servant tending a fair queen
    She works in beauty neither felt nor seen,
    While I have nature, all the whole earth over,
    For company. Yet anxious as a lover
    Prisoned in sentiment, I watch and start.
    Is it then just for you I live apart?
    The moon, as milk caught in a pail, now flows
    Over its rim, whit'ning the dark that glows--
    I saw your absence less by day, and less
    This summers brilliant, living emptiness.



    II


    Another day in flowered light comes through
    The curtains of the room that waits for you.
    I leave it so, to its Byronian gloom:
    In vain red roses at your casements bloom.
    The lyre-shaped clock that once struck hours of gold,
    Has stopped, the prisoned summer air turns cold.
    The mirrors that no longer see you pass,
    Seem frames without their pictures, lengths of glass
    Bored to reflect a house without expression.
    Only my mind can image the procession
    Of past realities, that flitter by
    Invisible to all. These guides and I
    Live a repeated life in which we follow
    Through the deserted rooms, through tree-topped hollow
    Roads, the joyful phantoms gone before.
    The rhododendrons hedge-like corridor,
    Must lead you, now and ever, back to me!
    As often as our eyes have sought the sea,
    I rest mine on this woodland resting-place.
    Ah when again, the blossom of your face?
    And, many times to aid the incantation,
    Seeking some proof to fix my meditation,
    I pause where the soft earth still bears the seals
    Of your once-waiting and impatient heels!
    And stoop, to find again the marks I found,
    The little marks your feet leave on the ground!






    A PILGRIMAGE.


    Is that your window with the moving shade
    In pilgrimage I've come so far to see?
    --The air may enter, you are not afraid
    Of the ¬´great air¬ª that plays invisibly
    About your neck, moving your opened hair
    (That busy shadow is perhaps your maid?)
    While I must wait, as near as I may be,
    Upon the sands, wishing that I were made
    Like Ariel to skip accross the sea
    Bringing you kisses, in small waves that bear
    The prostrate happy sun-flushed evening there,
    And all unseen cover you every where:
    To rise up with the tide and fall on you
    With lips that moisten, cling, and sting like spray--
    To want you, and so wanting turn away?
    Or beat my way into that prisoned hue:
    Now that your window is a golden square
    Cut in the darkness? Must I homeward fare
    With flapping cape against the wind to fight,
    Or like a sea-gull wing towards your light?

                     _D'une plage lointaine._





    BACKWARD


    /#
    "_The predominacy of custom is every
    where visible, it sounds as a man
    would wonder to hear man profess,
    protest, engage, give great words, and
    then do just as they have done before,
    as though they were dead images and
    moved only by the wheels of custom._"
                          _Francis BACON_.
    #/



    My Hopes white-plumed, in valiant mail,
    Have beaten at her heart grown pale
    --Have failed, as all proud hopes must fail--
    Lower the mast, fold up the sail.
    In vain we faced the high-winged gale
    And laughed as those whom Gods assail.
    The reefs near port now crush our bark,
    The jealous hounds of habit bark
    On land. As children in the dark
    My Lady shudders in the veil
    Of her meek hair--shall naught prevail?
    And only fears their echo find
    Within her torn and timid mind?

    Helplessly, my courage tears
    To free her of the doubts she wears
    Closer than Life.... Yet Time prepares
    The end of all things.... Melt, my tears!
    And flow as bitter as the sea
    Over my drowning Love and me!






    A SONNET


    TO MY LADY WITH THE JAUNDICE.


    Was not Titania golden? See these flowers
    Are they for being yellowish less fair?
    Apollo and the Godesses all share
    In this most glorious hue. The jealous bowers

    Of Kings are coloured thus, their reed of powers,
    Their rings, their chains, the crowns that they must wear
    Golden their mistress and their minion's hair
    Golden the bannered sun above their towers!

    Reflecting butter-cups amuses Puck
    But flower-rubbed eye-lids, and complexions mend:
    So fear not broken crystals long ill-luck

    But look in this new mirror, lovely friend.
    Both gods and fairies wait on lovers wills.
    That jaundices be changed to daffodils!






    EASTER DAY


    Much longer than these lilies, you or I,
    This book lives on mysterious memory
    Of an enchanted place to which you lent
    A fragrance that will render somnolent?
    --Sweet poisons are narcotics for our tears!
    Our ressurected past through dreams appears
    An angel standing by an empty tomb.
    What sadder thing may Time spin on her loom
    Than words?--Return to that once petaled door
    Through which Love passed--adding a few leaves more
    To the strange book of life: open its covers
    Only to the worn page where we were lovers
    Lost in fair imageries, there to forget
    Our hearts that weep as little children yet!






    LINES TAKEN FROM POEMS
    I SHALL NOT WRITE


                Love, all our colours
                Fade into shadows
                --Shadows, but empty
                Forms of the darkness?

                Pale with the spring-time,
                Wandering without you--
                Sick with love-sickness!

        To sigh upon this chill air of December,
        To wonder why, and wondering why, remember!

                As through the air
                Her little fan-shaped feet

    What beauty in the way the light fell on her eye-brows....

    These pages are as silent as drowned cries....
    Come back, my Love, and with more fervent eyes
    Than pity, Lips that bear the ivy-leaf
    Once chose for emblem Love that never dies?

        Bow thy head, O shadow on the wall,
        And weep a shadows grief.
        ... And so the rain arrived instead of you!
        Its falling tears on the seas bitterness....

        ... But I, who am loves prodigal and fool,
        What right have I to that high horse of verse?
        Whose wings in cadenced soaring sweep the sky
        Taking the waning moons for virgin dawns!
        Etherial beast to find a home in clouds
        And pasture on the plenteous voids of heaven!

        ... Small are these in love and in understanding ...
        Lift your voice in song, you alone can sing me
        Songs as white and strong as the marble columns
                       Of Mitylene

        Songs as pure pure as stars on the silver midnights,
        Near as moonbeams over the limbs of lovers,
        Strange as sleep in fields of lethean stillness
                   Heavy with summer.

        You alone can waken my soul to sorrow,
        You alone can mend all the broken music:
        Subtler tones of thought than this shattered singing
                     Words have divided!

        I cannot weep for you as others weep.
              My last and dearest dead,
        For all my tears on lesser griefs are shed!






    I BUILT A FIRE


    I built a fire to welcome her,
        And my voice sighed
    Aloud her name. To be with her
    This night, I would have died....
        Upon the hours, all in vain
        My tears, the rain,
    Fall uselessly, unceasingly....
        The heavy door
        Has closed again ... again!
    I wait, yet know she will not brave
        The midnight,--give
    One hour more, so utterly to live;
        Wise and mild and shy,
    Afraid as the heart of a child,
        I know her heart to be.
    And mine, that naught will save,
      Must love and live and crave
        And break unceasingly!






    HOW COLD ...


            How cold the autumn night,
              Fearing that never more,
                    As before,
                    Will she pour
        In with the moonlight through my door.
    --On nights when the moon over-brimmed with light
            Was like a loving-cup she bore.
            ... My love, my love's delight,
            How are you lost? How fight
                Against an angels flight?
                Tarnished upon the floor
              The halo desire kept bright!
              Like a lonely child afright
              Questions each empty fold ‚Äî
            When loves fairy tales are told,
              In midnights anguish might
              My golden head turn white
              Under the moons down-pour:
            In a moment a million moons more
            Drown, chill and cover me quite ...
              Rather than feel the cold,
              The gradual growing cold--
            Make me one with the autumn night.






    HABIT


    Ah! habit, how unmusical and shy
    That outworn miracle: our ecstacy!
    Between our hands that clasp their empty palms,
    This daily prayer is this our psalm of psalms!
    What is this nothing that was more than all?
    Thinned as a golden ring that dare not fall,
    That unsuspected danger: faithfulness,
    Has linked us strangers, and a something less!
    Exchanging vows and other platitudes,
    As beggars chained in separate solitudes,
    Though jealousy keep live the rotten core,
    Lovers that were be lovers nevermore.






    THE NEAR ENEMY


    Rash games of chess do hateful lovers play,
    Their towers, queens and kings all thrown away
    In wild offensives, desperate retreats.
    To that sick inner-sounding drum that beats
    In terror of some tender thing just killed!
    New warriors on the battle-field, unskilled
    In prudent war-fare: friends of yesterday
    What they most cherished seem most keen to slay.
    More treacherous than Prussians in command,
    Entrenched and feigning not to understand,
    They plan how best to poison, maim and mar!
    Masked in bad silence, turned against their star.
    Through what black forces are so changed to foes
    Those fed on our high hearts, yes, even those!






    LIFE


                                     Life,
                           The unloosening of hands
                      --The unloosening of little hands--
                               About the heart.
                           The welling up of tears:
                       Old habits, old deaths, good-bye!
                   You are sacred ground under my on-faring,
       I shall tread so lightly that you will not feel my leave-taking?
    Yet the breath of a new world--the ever promised-land--exalts my nostrils.
                      I am on the war-path towards peace:
                          The peace of single choice.
                            Determination--onward,
                         Evolutions open your arcana,
                   Shower down your nearest spears of truth,
                Great fear throbs in me, fear that leads me on,
                        I have shut my eyes long enough
                           --Shut eyes grow blind!--
                    Clinging to just one little human life!
                 Limiting, repressing all it would not share,
                        I who had an easy world to give
                     In the first heart-beats of my hope--
               Yet now, with forty years, has come another youth
                    --A youth in which I recognize myself!
             --Myself, how long you've lingered, waited, strayed--
                    Beauty seems an empty shell--out-worn.
           Great longing of my sea, break forth, be uncontained!...
                Count not your shipwrecks--every spar may save.
                      So I, not cruelly, not impetuously,
                    But with keen, shrewd resolve--rise up.
                     Why do I rise on timid stealthy feet?
                    In the dark to take leave of the dark,
                      To kiss the eyes of night farewell,
                And turn love's withered face full on the dawn.
                        May the dawn learn through me,
                  Not tint and play with empty shadows here,
                   But raise the arch of triumph of its day.
                  ... I hear a sound as of a world on flame.
                            My past a burning city?
                              Shall I look round?
                 --Salt of my earth: all my tears crystalized!
                  You'd call me back into the phantom house?
                  --O, Psyche holding high your awkward lamp,
                  O, Psyche, loved in darkness, see the day!






    FEMME


    Femme √† la souple charpente,
    Au poitrail courbe, arqu√© pour
    Les g√©missements d'amour,
    Mon d√©sir suivra tes pentes--
    Tes veines, branchages nains
    O√π la courbe rejoint l'angle;
    jambes fermant le triangle
    Du cher coffret f√©minin

    --O femme, source et br√ªlure--

    Je renverse dans ma main
    Ta t√™te--sommet humain.
    Cascade ta chevelure






    TIERCE-RIME


    Sensible aupr√®s de toi, muet comme l'enfance,
    Je t'offris la p√¢leur de l'√©t√© maladif
    Dans une seule rose ouverte et sans d√©fense.

    Quelle f√©e ouvragea, puis unit sans motif
    Ses p√©tales--qu'un fil de parfum semblait joindre--
    Et que tu vins casser d'un geste trop h√¢tif.

    Ils tombent un par un. Je te regarde feindre
    De ne pas voir combien se seront effeuill√©s.
    Ah! se d√©faire ainsi doucement sans se plaindre!

    Et j'embrasse en silence (aveugle que tu es!)
    De larmes, de baisers, tes deux mains que je touche
    Avec mes l√®vres moins qu'avec mes cils mouill√©s.

    Et tu repars distraite, et moi je me recouche
    Sur tout ton souvenir.... Tel un pauvre histrion,
    Je mime un r√¥le ardent sur ta lointaine bouche!

    Et nous pleurons ensemble ainsi que nous rions
    A l'heure passag√®re et vide--Ta pr√©sence,
    Amour, n'est donc jamais ce que nous voudrions?

    Quand perdras-tu sur moi ton √©trange puissance?
    Mon c≈ìur malade, ah! quand va-t-il ne plus sentir,
    Ou des yeux oublieux de la convalescence,

    Quand pourrai-je sans peur te regarder partir?






    J'AVAIS CRAINT LA NEIGE


                   J'avais craint la neige,
                   Je vous avais esp√©r√©e.
                   --La neige est venue,


                          La neige,
                  Pareille √† l'effeuillement
                        De ces roses.


    Soyez la premi√®re √† marcher sur la blancheur des p√©tales
            --Fleurs du froid effeuill√©es par l'hiver--
               Avant que d'autres ne les √©crasent.


    Les p√©tales tomb√©es, les √©toiles fondantes se rejoignent,
                      Dallage √©ph√©m√®re,
        Marquez l'empreinte de ses pieds tourn√©s vers moi!


                   Que la neige dans ma cour,
                      Tachet√©e par ses pas,
                    Soit un tapis d'hermine!






    SUFFISANCE


    Quand ton regard mi-clos, luisant entre tes cils,
    Peut √©voquer l'amour sans forme et sans visage,
    Tu ne r√™ves donc plus aux amants de passage?
    --Quelle joie √©galant ton d√©go√ªt t'offrent-ils?--
    Ils r√¥dent tels des loups √† l'aff√ªt d'une proie,
    D√©sirant mat ton corps que leur d√©sir salit;
    Mais, loin d'eux, ton d√©sir, seul ma√Ætre de ton lit,
    Reste le cr√©ateur nocturne de ta joie.
    Et lorsque le d√©sir te tient √©perd√ªment
    Livr√©e, et qu'il te rend plus ardente et plus souple,
    Lorsque ton √™tre double, √† la fois ton amant
    Et ta ma√Ætresse, sait te prendre, mieux qu'un couple
    Tu t'exaltes, ton geste est plus harmonieux.
    N'aimant que Toi, tu plains la femme qui s'encombre
    Du danger des amours faciles; toi, les yeux
    Pleins d'orgueil, tu ne sert qu'√† ta beaut√©, dans l'ombre.






    VERS LIBRES


    Ils sont l√†, quelque part, les √™tres de mon c≈ìur,
                Dans de sombres demeures,
                Gard√©s par des esclaves ...
                Moi, je vais sans entraves,
                Et me navre de leurs peurs.


                J'abattrai les cloisons
                De leurs dures maisons,
                Les sauvant de leurs murs,
                Car c'est moi qui endure
                La vue de leurs prisons ...

              Et pendant que toi tu dors,
           C'est moi que l'on enferme--dehors!






    UN VIEUX CHAT DE MIS√àRE


    Un vieux chat de mis√®re
    Est entr√© dans ma serre,
    Charg√© des √©l√©ments
    Electriques de l'orage--
    Ses yeux, charbons ardents,
    Br√ªlent au dedans
    De sa t√™te sans pelage--
    De sa vieille t√™te d'amant,
    D√©chiquet√©e par la guerre,
    L amour et le carnage;
    Il manque d'aliments,
    Non d'ongles ni de dents!


    Enviez-les gens prudents,
    Soupirez, √¥ femmes sages!






    DISTIQUES


    Tu veux que je te fasse un amoureux po√®me.
    Ecoute donc plut√¥t si mon silence t'aime!

    Je ne saurais donner au sage alexandrin
    Les plaintes du plaisir, le rythme de nos reins!

    Quand, sous mon corps √©lu, je sens battre ta joie,
    Exprimer mon d√©sir qui t'effleure et te broie?

    Sois ma ma√Ætresse douce et folle; au lieu de mots
    Accepte sur ta chair d'extatiques sanglots!

    Et lorsque je retombe avec toi--si ma bouche,
    Eloquence muette, est celle qui te touche,

    Laisse moi parcourir ton √™tre harmonieux
    De tes pieds recourb√©s √† tes courbes cheveux.

    Nerfs d'accord, bien tendus: musique, sortil√®ge,
    Harpe dont je d√©tiens le secret des arp√®ges--

    Pour toi, l'art de mes mains, orgueilleux instrument,
    Fait l'amour en po√®te, et les vers en amant!






    EFFLUVE D'UN VIEUX LIVRE


    Effluve dun vieux livre,
    Humide odeur du temps--
    Console bien de vivre
    --De vivre trop longtemps--
    Dans ces pages respire
    Le pass√© des √©lans,
    Des voyages √† lire
    Par ce vieux nouvel an!






    MES MORTS


    _Je suis ivre du vin des t√©n√®bres, plus fort_
    _Que le vin des vivants: l'amour plante sa vigne_
    _Au-del√† de la vie. Et mon c≈ìur, enfin digne_
    _De son sang survivant, va revivre ses morts._


    A chaque projet de voyage
    Une blessure s'ouvre en moi.
    --J'ai bien trop aim√© des visages
    Pendant des saisons et des mois!
    --Semblant choisir une personne
    --Aigu comme un chat Siamois--
    Mon d√©sir fixe s'y cramponne
    De ses yeux clairs, phosphorescents.
    Et je te prend et je me donne,
    --Et tout redevient innocent:

    Deux fauves vivant leur idylle
    De cris, puis √¢me, vos accents!
    Et c'est l'amour qui fait la ville
    D√©serte, et peuple le d√©sert!
    --Allons √† Tunis, √† S√©ville,
    A Bagdad, au P√¥le sud?--vers
    Ce jardin suspendu, miracle,
    Ce lit de fleurs sur l'univers.
    Seules ensemble, qu'on me b√¢cle
    Ces souvenirs, que libres, nus,
    Nous √©chappions aux d√©b√¢cles....

    Quels sont ces √™tres inconnus?
    Nous attendant apr√®s la houle ...
    Au nouveau monde survenu?
    Quels sont ces mendiants, ces foules?
    --Ah! tous nos morts sont avec nous!
    J'ai le vin triste: rien ne sao√ªle!

    Et seuls √† seuls et √† genoux,
    Mes morts sont venus me reprendre,
    --O√π fuir leurs terribles yeux doux?
    Pas de Cyth√®re, il faut descendre,
    --Il faut se quitter au retour?
    Chez moi, plus rien ne me demande,
    Assez de landes et de "moors",
    De villas et de cimeti√®res--
    Pour t'enterrer vivant, amour?
    Et vous, mes ardentes poussi√®res,
    Vous tous mes Morts, mes Sans-Soucis,
    Je vous reviens donc toute enti√®re?

    Ces quais, ces platanes: Passy!
    Je vous reconduis √† la porte
    Du cimeti√®re que voici!
    Trop tard pour entrer mais qu'importe!
    --Ce haut navire attend Paris:
    Mon tout premier amour, ma morte....
    Pleurez encor, mes yeux taris!...






    L'AUBE


    L'aube.
    Le sifflement d'un train
    D√©chirure ... Banlieue ... Aube.
    Quelqu'un qui n'est pas dans mon sommeil me touche l'√©paule,
    --Quelqu'un qui n'est pas dans mon sommeil me dit: L√®ve-toi: viens

    Et mon coeur saute, hors de son √©l√©ment, vers le soleil:
    Un instant mon c≈ìur m'√©chappe--
    Puis mon corps reprend son fardeau d'angoisse:
    Ma chair enceinte de mon c≈ìur bat:
    Et je redeviens le rythme et la chose de mon c≈ìur.
    Mon c≈ìur, domin√© par sa prison, s'√©galise,
    Reprend son cours, se fait au jour √† vivre.
    --Jours √† vivre: orchestration du bruit: tout se tait dans le bruit--
    Pr√™t √† oublier ce saut hors de soi qui voulait rena√Ætre ...
    Ailleurs, l'aube passe!






    R√âVEILLON


    Puisqu aucun soir nouveau ne vient tourner la page,
    Je vis pench√©e encor sur la derni√®re image:
    Et reste en la turquoise enclose, √† votre table,
    T'invitant, souvenir, √† ces mets d√©lectables
    Qui triomphent des vins, et fleuri de nos verres,
    Votre visage au bout d'un chemin de lumi√®res!
    Moi, face √† votre face entre les dix chandelles,
    Je vois briller pour moi les douces √©tincelles
    De vos yeux, de vos dents entre vos fr√™les joues,
    Et les doigts scintillants, et votre ombre qui joue
    D'un roseau ... fait jaillir parmi des pierreries
    L'art nocturne des sons en longues r√™veries ...
    Et je reste attentive √† la place o√π vous f√ªtes!...

    Plus tard, vers le silence autre des autres fl√ªtes
    Qui furent consacr√©es jadis aux fumeries,
    --Nos pieds v√™tus de soie et parmi vos soieries--
    Nous suivons la doctrine agr√©able et sto√Øque
    D'un sage qui remue une √¢me asiatique,
    Tandis que se d√©double, en route droite et fine,
    L'encens: souffle du dieu mont√© vers nos narines!






    BAL PAR√â


    Le trente Juin, vers les dix heures,
    Daignez √©tonner vos miroirs
    De travestis et de loups noirs,
    Et venir, laissant vos demeures,
    Jusqu'√† mon petit pavillon.
    Nous y dessinerons des danses
    De jadis, et maintes cadenses
    Pr√©f√©rables au cotillon.
    La vie ayant sa parodie,
    On donnera la com√©die,
    Ou bien des airs au clavecin
    Egr√®neront leur m√©lodie.
    Mais tant me pla√Æt que sans dessein
    Chaque heure am√®ne sa plaisance,
    Que ce programme est incertain:
    Je veux surtout votre pr√©sence
    Du soir jusqu'au nouveau matin.
    Dans vos d√©guisements fantasques
    Vous me serez les bienvenus,
    Par vos sourires reconnus
    Sous l'uniformit√© des masques.






    F√äTES


    Les lanternes parmi les arbres ont des joues
    Peintes: telles mousm√©s lumineuses qu'on loue!
    La chasse aux vers luisants prendra pour son ta√Øaut
    Les sons de quelque fl√ªte invisible qui joue:
    Arabesques d'une √¢me ancestrale et mantchoue
    Qui s'enfle du d√©sir d'arriver sans d√©faut
    A cette lune prise au pommier le plus haut?


            Un tourbillon de neige,
              Comme les lucioles
                Ont blanchi!
            .......................
            En ajoutant vos regards
           Aux regards de mes h√¥tes,
         Je croirai au retour des lucioles.

    Voici du ma√Ætre Avril la fr√™le orf√®vrerie:
    Hyacinthes, muguets, cloisons pleines de miel;
    La branche du pommier, fragilement fleurie,
    Semble √™tre l'√©ph√©m√®re ouvrage d'Ariel.
    Je mets tout ce printemps sur ton grand lit: qu'il vienne
    Se rouler √† tes pieds afin qu'il t'en souvienne.






    DIFF√âRENCES


    Vous vivez du temps qu'il fait,
    De projets et de voyages;
    De tel ennui, de tel fait,
    Dun besoin d'air, de visages
    Nouveaux, de rien et de tout.



    Je ne vis que de vous...



    De vous ... et sans voir les pages
    Des livres, de tout distrait,
    Ma barque est un lit d√©fait,
    Vos traits sont mes paysages,
    L'air qu'il me faut sont vos doux



    Parfums: je vis de vous!






    JEUX SUPR√äMES


    Ce toit porte ta nudit√©,
    Ta forme: couleur ou bien vivre.
    Je bois le loin de ma bouche ivre
    De ta divine crudit√©.


    En pleine chair, en plein ciel suis-je,
    (Tr√©buchant vers quatre horizons
    Pour retomber en un frisson)
    Seule pour ce double vertige?


    Quitter, en tremblant des genoux,
    Ce baldaquin o√π la nuit s√®me
    Peu d'astres, descendre de m√™me
    Vers Paris--√©teint comme vous!






    VERS PRIS AUX PO√àMES QUE JE N'√âCRIRAI PAS


    Sentiments exprim√©s: libretti d'op√©ra.

    La saveur √† venir des choses retrouv√©es...

            Ces lointaines vall√©es
            Qui fument de l'azur...

              Je fus heureux
            Avec ses seuls yeux
         --Et cet amour miraculeux
              Entre nous deux.

           Heureuses, bienheureuses,
           Les villes vaniteuses
           Se mirent dans ses eaux...

    Un homme, au chapeau dur, de la ville coupable,
    A travers la for√™t a l'air d'un corbillard.

    L'humidit√© du sol clapote √† mes semelles,

    Mars accourt, secouant ses √©charpes de vent.

            De toute leur adolescence
            Ils se ruent contre la nuit.

    Le mois de mai, comme un po√®te anglais

    Le soleil est venu me chercher dans mon lit

            S'en aller n'importe o√π,
            Le bras autour d'un cou.

    Vers ces autres couleurs que contiennent nos ombres.

    Piano: harpe couch√©e en ton cercueil sonore.

    Harpe, eau mise en musique, cordes ... pluie...

    Quelque mort pourrissant au fond des mar√©cages

    Et le cr√©puscule laisse tomber la lune....
    La lune, lanterne sourde aux mains de la nuit...

              Luisante aum√¥ne,
    Pi√®ce d'argent que nous jette la nuit...

    La lune haut cern√©e de tout son devenir...

    Son profil blanc et froid: un fragment de la lune

    Et ses mains dans la nuit, fargilit√©s lunaires.

    Les grands bouleaux aux yeux de Pharaonne,
    Noirs dans leur blanche peau.

            De ma verdure citadine.
            La branche verte se dandine
            A ma fen√™tre--Un vers anglais
            Ignore le mal qu'il me fait.

    M'√©vanouir dans du brouillard

    La face d'un noy√© flotte au ras des hublots.






    LE PREMIER D√âPART


           Ah! le silence, le multiple silence,
                 Vivant dans les d√©parts,
       Et le pressentiment traversant comme un phare
                  L'ombre et la distance.
         Qu'elle semble loin, qu elle semble tard
                        L'absence.

    Dans un tourbillon d'heures--un jour, pas davantage--
                     Que de naufrages,
                   Que de d√©bris √©pars,
                 Rest√©s de ces naufrages!

                  Et cet embrun aux yeux,
                Et ces morts sur la plage,
       Et ces tr√©sors sombr√©s au fond de la douleur
                La houle de vagues au c≈ìur!






    AUCUNE CLEF N'A LE DESTIN


    Les bourgeois rentrent un par un
    Ou deux par deux: dans l'habitude
    De partager leurs solitudes
    --Des clefs ils ont la certitude!
    Aucune clef n'a le destin!
    je loge enfin pr√®s de ta rue;
    --Mais toi tu semble disparue.
    Ah! si tu m'√©tais accourue!
    Je veille, et c'est d√©j√† demain!
    La route blanche sous la neige
    Tourne vers ton absence; fais-je
    Bien de rester seule, que sais-je?
    M'emmurer d'un ¬´secret jardin¬ª,
    Mourir des fleurs de lune mortes?
    La poigne de mes mains est forte.
    Garde aux spectres: j'ouvre la porte--
    Reprendre, vivante, tes mains!
    ... Le pass√© n'est un pur festin
    De fl√ªtes et luths d√©lectables,
    Que si l'amour inalt√©rable
    Se plait encor √† notre table!






    √âQUINOXE


              Ce soir, j'ai tout l'automne en moi,
    Ses gris, ses d√©sespoirs, ses morts et ses temp√™tes,
              Et tout le mena√ßant √©moi
    Des malfaiteurs de route--oh fi√®res et fortes t√™tes!
    Moi, le d√©sh√©rit√© des humains, dont vous √™tes,
              Volontaire d√©sh√©rit√©,
    Que vous me faites mal avec votre ga√Æt√©!
              --Car j'ai quitt√© toutes vos f√™tes.
    Prenez garde! je vous rendrai le mal que vous me faites.
    Je suis le Juif errant et le d√©sh√©rit√©--
    Dieu de ma destin√©e, et souvent de la tienne,
              O femmes, trop diverses: ¬´toi¬ª.
              Mais, la marque reste seule en moi.--
    Toi, par le mauvais temps, faut-il qu'il t'en souvienne
              --A peine?
    Voici venir l'automne, et l'on rentre chez soi:
    L'amour familial dans la maison jolie!
    Mais nous qui nous chauffons au feu de la folie,
    O√π donc est notre √©paule, o√π donc est notre toit?
    Amants des grands chemins, usons nos bons cerveaux,
              Nos bras qui ne savent qu'√©treindre.
    --Etreindre? Mieux vaudrait √©trangler--et sans geindre
    Se tuer dans l'√©gout pour l'amour vieux-nouveau,
    La face bien marqu√©e de tous leurs crocs, (r√©pliques
    Que nous auront donn√©es ces chiennes dites nos s≈ìurs)
    Mais la face lev√©e vers le ciel, extatiques,
              D'un dernier coup de poing, au c≈ìur!






    NUIT BACHIQUE


    Ivre de boire √† flots la belle nuit bachique,
    Je n'avais plus besoin que vous vous soyiez Vous:
    --Je n'avais plus besoin de la bonne musique!

    Je m√¢chais des d√©bris d'√©toiles--tels des fous
    Se reposant enfin d'√™tre de trop eux-m√™mes
    --Des dieux impersonnels courtisent mes genoux.

    Les ombres prenaient corps. Je leur disais "je t'aime"
    --Disant √† tout: "je t'aime" est-ce √† toi seule, √† Toi
    Nuit dont je partageais les vastes diad√®mes!

    J'√©tais libre un instant, universel et roi
    --Libre des sentiments qui font notre esclavage,
    Mais me voici repris par tout le d√©sarroi ...

    Par le doute et le trouble et le double engrenage!
    Je ne suis plus que moi! Les choses d'alentour
    Ne sont plus qu'√† leur place ... Et s√ªr d'un seul visage
    J'ai quitt√© tout amour pour retrouver l'Amour!






    L'≈íUVRE √âTRANGE


    Mes mains, sculpteurs incomp√©tents,
    Cherchent √† faire leur statue:
    J'oppose une lutte t√™tue
    Au vide; mes gestes contents
    Tracent tes poses effac√©es,
    Et mon √©cho poursuit en vain
    Dans le silence--ce ravin--
    Les voix aux formes enlac√©es.

    Echapp√© de mes doigts palpant
    Ton corps--√©clipse ou suicide?--
    Dans cet espace, o√π co√Øncident
    Des cubes d'air entre des pans
    De mur, limites plus opaques
    De contenir le transparent
    O√π flottent vos contours errants,
    Sir√®ne, aux st√©riles attaques?

    ... Faut-il que l'immat√©riel
    Nous ouvre √† jamais tous ses gouffres
    De l'≈ìuvre √©trange dont je souffre
    Monte la race d'Ariel!






    SONNET D'AUTREFOIS.


    (Genre Anthologie!)


    Sans plus t√¢cher de plaire ou m√™me d'√©mouvoir,
    Laisse-moi m'approcher de toi, plus virginale
    Que la neige; apprends-moi ta paix impartiale,
    An√©antis en moi la force et le vouloir.

    Je veux cacher mes yeux, plus tristes que le soir,
    A tes yeux, oublier jusqu'au petit ovale
    De ta face, et, mon front dans le frais intervalle
    De tes seins, sangloter des larmes sans espoir.

    Mes pleurs sont un poison tr√®s lent que je veux boire,
    Au lieu de mendier √† quelque amour banal
    L'ingrate gu√©rison, l'aveuglement final.

    Pr√®s de toi mon d√©sir se consume, illusoire.
    O mes regrets! combien j'√©prouve encor ce mal
    De r√™ver au bonheur auquel on ne peut croire.






    M√âDUSES


    Dans la for√™t de mort, sans saisons, sans feuillages,
    --O√π la s√®ve des pins, de leurs troncs mutil√©s,
    Coule en lente agonie--il est un exil√©
    De la vie, attendant de vains appareillages.

    Il regarde la vague apporter sur la plage
    Les masques transparents, aux traits annihil√©s,
    Des m√©duses.--Semblable aux ruines de Phil√¶,
    A ces visages d'eau s'oppose son visage.

    Masques faits et d√©faits du mouvement des flots,
    La mer toujours les roule √† m√™me ses sanglots,
    Des soleils de minuit jusqu'√† l'aube des lunes.

    Les immol√©s ont tous la face de J√©sus,
    Qui, des sables passifs, rejet√©s par le flux,
    Comptent le temps sans fin au sablier des dunes.






    √âPILOGUE


    Amis, voici mon livre; et qu'il n'ait aucun vice
    Autre que celui-l√† dont nous sommes complices!
    Des amours d√©cid√©s dans notre froid cerveau:
    Pr√©parer sa folie et le geste qui vaut
    Est affaire de sport, non de veule nature;
    Car pour nous ressembler, cr√©er notre aventure,
    Il nous faut d√©jouer tous les jeux du hasard,
    Cong√©dier le sort, se choisir, non trop tard,
    Ses poisons, se disant: C'est moi qui m'ex√©cute.
    --je ne serai jamais celui que pers√©cute
    Autrui qui m'indiff√®re.--Et j'assiste, invit√©
    Curieux, mais distant, √† l'Emotivit√©.
    Et l'on ne m'aimera que si je veux qu'on m'aime!
    ... Mais parfois je m'invente un plus proche moi-m√™me.

    --M√©canisme du corps, visc√®res: peuple vil....
    Ob√©is √† ce moi d√©tourn√© de profil;
    Puisque la volont√© m'incite √† l'√©nergie,
    Je veux bien que ces vers portent mon effigie.
