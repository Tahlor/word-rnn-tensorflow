_A Poem, in Two Parts._
Philosophical Notes.
The general design of the following sheets is to inlist Imagination
under the banner of Science; and to lead her votaries from the looser
analogies, which dress out the imagery of poetry, to the stricter, ones
which form the ratiocination of philosophy. While their particular
design is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the knowledge of Botany,
by introducing them to the vestibule of that delightful science, and
recommending to their attention the immortal works of the celebrated
Swedish Naturalist, LINNEUS.
In the first Poem, or Economy of Vegetation, the physiology of Plants is
delivered; and the operation of the Elements, as far as they may be
supposed to affect the growth of Vegetables. In the second Poem, or
Loves of the Plants, the Sexual System of Linneus is explained, with the
remarkable properties of many particular plants.
It may be proper here to apologize for many of the subsequent
conjectures on some articles of natural philosophy, as not being
supported by accurate investigation or conclusive experiments.
Extravagant theories however in those parts of philosophy, where our
knowledge is yet imperfect, are not without their use; as they encourage
the execution of laborious experiments, or the investigation of
ingenious deductions, to confirm or refute them. And since natural
objects are allied to each other by many affinities, every kind of
theoretic distribution of them adds to our knowledge by developing some
of their analogies.
The Rosicrucian doctrine of Gnomes, Sylphs, Nymphs, and Salamanders, was
thought to afford a proper machinery for a Botanic poem; as it is
probable, that they were originally the names of hieroglyphic figures
representing the elements.
Many of the important operations of Nature were shadowed or allegorized
in the heathen mythology, as the first Cupid springing from the Egg of
Night, the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, the Rape of Proserpine, the
Congress of Jupiter and Juno, Death and Resuscitation of Adonis, &c.
many of which are ingeniously explained in the works of Bacon, Vol. V.
p. 47. 4th Edit. London, 1778. The Egyptians were possessed of many
discoveries in philosophy and chemistry before the invention of letters;
these were then expressed in hieroglyphic paintings of men and animals;
which after the discovery of the alphabet were described and animated by
the poets, and became first the deities of Egypt, and afterwards of
Greece and Rome. Allusions to those fables were therefore thought proper
ornaments to a philosophical poem, and are occasionally introduced
either as represented by the poets, or preserved on the numerous gems
and medallions of antiquity.
Oft tho' thy genius, D----! amply fraught
With native wealth, explore new worlds of mind;
Whence the bright ores of drossless wisdom brought,
Stampt by the Muse's hand, enrich mankind;
Tho' willing Nature to thy curious eye,
Involved in night, her mazy depths betray;
Till at their source thy piercing search descry
The streams, that bathe with Life our mortal clay;
Tho', boldly soaring in sublimer mood
Through trackless skies on metaphysic wings,
Thou darest to scan the approachless Cause of Good,
And weigh with steadfast hand the Sum of Things;
Yet wilt thou, charm'd amid his whispering bowers
Oft with lone step by glittering Derwent stray,
Mark his green foliage, count his musky flowers,
That blush or tremble to the rising ray;
While FANCY, seated in her rock-roof'd dell,
Listening the secrets of the vernal grove,
Breathes sweetest strains to thy symphonious shell,
And gives new echoes to the throne of Love.

STAY YOUR RUDE STEPS! whose throbbing breasts infold
The legion-fiends of Glory, or of Gold!
Stay! whose false lips seductive simpers part,
While Cunning nestles in the harlot-heart!--
For you no Nymphs their sparkling vases pour;
Unmark'd by you, light Graces swim the green,
And hovering Cupids aim their shafts, unseen.
"But THOU! whose mind the well-attemper'd ray
Whose finer sense each soft vibration owns
With sweet responsive sympathy of tones;
So the fair flower expands it's lucid form
To meet the sun, and shuts it to the storm;--
My fountains murmur, and my zephyrs breathe;
Slow slides the painted snail, the gilded fly
Smooths his fine down, to charm thy curious eye;
On twinkling fins my pearly nations play,
My plumy pairs in gay embroidery dress'd
Form with ingenious bill the pensile nest,
To Love's sweet notes attune the listening dell,
And Echo sounds her soft symphonious shell.
of the philosophy of Epicurus to render the mind exquisitely sensible to
Disasterous Love companion of her way,
Oh, lead her timid steps to yonder glade,
Whose arching cliffs depending alders shade;
There, as meek Evening wakes her temperate breeze,
The rills, that gurgle round, shall soothe her ear,
The weeping rocks shall number tear for tear;
There as sad Philomel, alike forlorn,
Sings to the Night from her accustomed thorn;
Sighs in the gale, and whispers round the grot;
The sister-woe shall calm her aching breast,
And softer slumbers steal her cares to rest.--
about a mile from Lichfield, where a cold bath was erected by Sir John
Floyer. There is a grotto surrounded by projecting rocks, from the edges
of which trickles a perpetual shower of water; and it is here
represented as adapted to love-scenes, as being thence a proper
residence for the modern goddess of Botany, and the easier to introduce
the next poem on the Loves of the Plants according to the system of
"Winds of the North! restrain your icy gales,
Hence in dark heaps, ye gathering Clouds, revolve!
Disperse, ye Lightnings! and, ye Mists, dissolve!
--Hither, emerging from yon orient skies,
BOTANIC GODDESS! bend thy radiant eyes;
Pomona, Ceres, Flora in thy train;
O'er the still dawn thy placid smile effuse,
And with thy silver sandals print the dews;
In noon's bright blaze thy vermil vest unfold,
Thus spoke the GENIUS, as He stept along,
And bade these lawns to Peace and Truth belong;
Down the steep slopes He led with modest skill
The willing pathway, and the truant rill,
Where shines the lake amid the tufted ground,
Raised the young woodland, smooth'd the wavy green,
And gave to Beauty all the quiet scene.--
She comes!--the GODDESS!--through the whispering air,
Each circling wheel a wreath of flowers intwines,
And gem'd with flowers the silken harness shines;
The golden bits with flowery studs are deck'd,
And knots of flowers the crimson reins connect.--
And the shell sinks upon its slender springs;
Light from her airy seat the Goddess bounds,
And steps celestial press the pansied grounds.
Fair Spring advancing calls her feather'd quire,
Bids her gay hours on purple pinions move,
And arms her Zephyrs with the shafts of Love,
Pleased GNOMES, ascending from their earthy beds,
Play round her graceful footsteps, as she treads;
On winnowing wings, and waft her golden hair;
Blue NYMPHS emerging leave their sparkling streams,
And FIERY FORMS alight from orient beams;
Musk'd in the rose's lap fresh dews they shed,
Nymphs, and Salamanders affords proper machinery for a philosophic poem;
as it is probable that they were originally the names of hieroglyphic
figures of the Elements, or of Genii presiding over their operations.
The Fairies of more modern days seem to have been derived from them, and
to have inherited their powers. The Gnomes and Sylphs, as being more
nearly allied to modern Fairies are represented as either male or
female, which distinguishes the latter from the Aurae of the Latin
Poets, which were only female; except the winds, as Zephyrus and Auster,
First the fine Forms her dulcet voice requires,
Which bathe or bask in elemental fires;
From each bright gem of Day's refulgent car,
From the pale sphere of every twinkling star,
With eye of flame the sparkling hosts repair,
Mix their gay hues, in changeful circles play,
Like motes, that tenant the meridian ray.--
So the clear Lens collects with magic power
Stars after stars with quivering lustre fall,
And twinkling glide along the whiten'd wall.--
Pleased, as they pass, she counts the glittering bands,
And stills their murmur with her waving hands;
And now to these, and now to those, she turns.
I. "NYMPHS OF PRIMEVAL FIRE! YOUR vestal train
Hung with gold-tresses o'er the vast inane,
Pierced with your silver shafts the throne of Night,
When LOVE DIVINE, with brooding wings unfurl'd,
Call'd from the rude abyss the living world.
"--LET THERE BE LIGHT!" proclaim'd the ALMIGHTY LORD,
Astonish'd Chaos heard the potent word;--
And the mass starts into a million suns;
Earths round each sun with quick explosions burst,
And second planets issue from the first;
Bend, as they journey with projectile force,
Orbs wheel in orbs, round centres centres roll,
And form, self-balanced, one revolving Whole.
--Onward they move amid their bright abode,
Space without bound, THE BOSOM OF THEIR GOD!
the most extensive element in nature; all other bodies are immersed in
it, and are preserved in their present state of solidity or fluidity by
the attraction of their particles to the matter of heat. Since all known
bodies are contractible into less space by depriving them of some
portion of their heat, and as there is no part of nature totally
deprived of heat, there is reason to believe that the particles of
bodies do not touch, but are held towards each other by their self-
attraction, and recede from each other by their attraction to the mass
of heat which surrounds them; and thus exist in an equilibrium between
these two powers. If more of the matter of heat be applied to them, they
recede further from each other, and become fluid; if still more be
applied, they take an aerial form, and are termed Gasses by the modern
chemists. Thus when water is heated to a certain degree, it would
instantly assume the form of steam, but for the pressure of the
atmosphere, which prevents this change from taking place so easily; the
same is true of quicksilver, diamonds, and of perhaps all other bodies
in Nature; they would first become fluid, and then aeriform by
appropriated degrees of heat. On the contrary, this elastic matter of
heat, termed Calorique in the new nomenclature of the French
Academicians, is liable to become consolidated itself in its
combinations with some bodies, as perhaps in nitre, and probably in
combustible bodies as sulphur and charcoal. See note on l. 232, of this
Canto. Modern philosophers have not yet been able to decide whether
light and heat be different fluids, or modifications of the same fluid,
as they have many properties in common. See note on l. 462 of this
of the young animal or plant from its egg or seed; and afterwards its
successive advances to its more perfect state, or maturity; philosophers
of all ages seem to have imagined, that the great world itself had
likewise its infancy and its gradual progress to maturity; this seems to
have given origin to the very antient and sublime allegory of Eros, or
Divine Love, producing the world from the egg of Night, as it floated in
Chaos. See l. 419. of this Canto.
The external crust of the earth, as far as it has been exposed to our
view in mines or mountains, countenances this opinion; since these have
evidently for the most part had their origin from the shells of fishes,
the decomposition of vegetables, and the recrements of other animal
materials, and must therefore have been formed progressively from small
beginnings. There are likewise some apparently useless or incomplete
appendages to plants and animals, which seem to shew they have gradually
undergone changes from their original state; such as the stamens without
anthers, and styles without stigmas of several plants, as mentioned in
the note on Curcuma, Vol. II. of this work. Such is the halteres, or
rudiments of wings of some two-winged insects; and the paps of male
animals; thus swine have four toes, but two of them are imperfectly
formed, and not long enough for use. The allantoide in some animals
seems to have become extinct; in others is above tenfold the size, which
would seem necessary for its purpose. Buffon du Cochon. T. 6. p. 257.
Perhaps all the supposed monstrous births of Nature are remains of their
habits of production in their former less perfect state, or attempts
and curious account of the construction of the heavens with his
discovery of some thousand nebulae, or clouds of stars; many of which
are much larger collections of stars, than all those put together, which
are visible to our naked eyes, added to those which form the galaxy, or
milky zone, which surrounds us. He observes that in the vicinity of
these clusters of stars there are proportionally fewer stars than in
other parts of the heavens; and hence he concludes, that they have
attracted each other, on the supposition that infinite space was at
first equally sprinkled with them; as if it had at the beginning been
filled with a fluid mass, which had coagulated. Mr. Herschel has further
shewn, that the whole sidereal system is gradually moving round some
centre, which may be an opake mass of matter, Philos. Trans. V. LXXIV.
If all these Suns are moving round some great central body; they must
have had a projectile force, as well as a centripetal one; and may
thence be supposed to have emerged or been projected from the material,
where they were produced. We can have no idea of a natural power, which
could project a Sun out of Chaos, except by comparing it to the
explosions or earthquakes owing to the sudden evolution of aqueous or of
other more elastic vapours; of the power of which under immeasurable
degrees of heat, and compression, we are yet ignorant.
It may be objected, that if the stars had been projected from a Chaos by
explosions, that they must have returned again into it from the known
laws of gravitation; this however would not happen, if the whole of
Chaos, like grains of gunpowder, was exploded at the same time, and
dispersed through infinite space at once, or in quick succession, in
every possible direction. The same objection may be stated against the
possibility of the planets having been thrown from the sun by
explosions; and the secondary planets from the primary ones; which will
be spoken of more at large in the second Canto, but if the planets are
supposed to have been projected from their suns, and the secondary from
the primary ones, at the beginning of their course; they might be so
influenced or diverted by the attractions of the suns, or sun, in their
vicinity, as to prevent their tendency to return into the body, from
which they were projected.
If these innumerable and immense suns thus rising out of Chaos are
supposed to have thrown out their attendant planets by new explosions,
as they ascended; and those their respective satellites, filling in a
moment the immensity of space with light and motion, a grander idea

And pleased untwist the sevenfold threads of light;

the lightening, the rainbow, and the clouds, are phenomena of the lower
regions of the atmosphere. The twilight, the meteors call'd fire-balls,
or flying dragons, and the northern lights, inhabit the higher regions
called inflammable air, is at least ten times lighter than common air;
Mr. Lavoisier contends, that it is one of the component parts of water,
and is by him called hydrogene. It is supposed to afford their principal
nourishment to vegetables and thence to animals, and is perpetually
rising from their decomposition; this source of it in hot climates, and
in summer months, is so great as to exceed estimation. Now if this light
gas passes through the atmosphere, without combining with it, it must
compose another atmosphere over the aerial one; which must expand, when
the pressure above it is thus taken away, to inconceivable tenuity.
If this supernatural gasseous atmosphere floats upon the aerial one,
like ether upon water, what must happen? 1. it will flow from the line,
where it will be produced in the greatest quantities, and become much
accumulated over the poles of the earth; 2. the common air, or lower
stratum of the atmosphere, will be much thinner over the poles than at
the line; because if a glass globe be filled with oil and water, and
whirled upon its axis, the centrifugal power will carry the heavier
fluid to the circumference, and the lighter will in consequence be found
round the axis. 3. There may be a place at some certain latitude between
the poles and the line on each side the equator, where the inflammable
supernatant atmosphere may end, owing to the greater centrifugal force
of the heavier aerial atmosphere. 4. Between the termination of the
aerial and the beginning of the gasseous atmosphere, the airs will
occasionally be intermixed, and thus become inflammable by the electric
spark; these circumstances will assist in explaining the phenomena of
fire-balls, northern lights, and of some variable winds, and long
continued rains.
Since the above note was first written, Mr. Volta I am informed has
applied the supposition of a supernatant atmosphere of inflammable air,
to explain some phenomena in meteorology. And Mr. Lavoisier has
announced his design to write on this subject. Traite de Chimie, Tom. I.
I am happy to find these opinions supported by such respectable
region where the light of the sun ceases to be refracted to us, is
estimated by philosophers to be between 40 and 50 miles high, at which
time the sun is about 18 degrees below the horizon; and the rarity of
the air is supposed to be from 4,000 to 10,000 times greater than at the
surface of the earth. Cotes's Hydrost. p. 123. The duration of twilight
differs in different seasons and in different latitudes; in England the
shortest twilight is about the beginning of October and of March; in
more northern latitudes, where the sun never sinks more than 18 degrees,
below the horizon, the twilight continues the whole night. The time of
its duration may also be occasionally affected by the varying height of
the atmosphere. A number of observations on the duration of twilight in
different latitudes might afford considerable information concerning the
aerial strata in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and might assist
in determining whether an exterior atmosphere of inflammable gas, or

And pleased she clasps them with extended wings.
the central parts of the earth consist of a fluid mass of burning lava,
which they have called a subterraneous sun; and have supposed, that it
contributes to the production of metals, and to the growth of

eruptions is believed to be owing to the water of the sea, or from
lakes, or inundations, finding itself a passage into the subterraneous
fires, which may lie at great depths. This must first produce by its
coldness a condensation of the vapour there existing, or a vacuum, and
thus occasion parts of the earth's crust or shell to be forced down by
the pressure of the incumbent atmosphere. Afterwards the water being
suddenly raised into steam produces all the explosive effects of
earthquakes. And by new accessions of water during the intervals of the
explosions the repetition of the shocks is caused. These circumstances
were hourly illustrated by the fountains of boiling water in Iceland, in
which the surface of the water in the boiling wells sunk down low before
every new ebullition.
Besides these eruptions occasioned by the steam of water, there seems to
be a perpetual effusion of other vapours, more noxious and (as far as it
is yet known) perhaps greatly more expansile than water from the
Volcanos in various parts of the world. As these Volcanos are supposed
to be spiracula or breathing holes to the great subterraneous fires, it
is probable that the escape of elastic vapours from them is the cause,
that the earthquakes of modern days are of such small extent compared to
those of antient times, of which vestiges remain in every part of the
world, and on this account may be said not only to be innocuous, but

With smiles celestial bless'd their dazzled sight,

conductors of electricity, is known to be a bad conductor of heat; and
thence prevents the heat acquired from the sun's rays by the earth's
surface from being so soon dissipated, in the same manner as a blanket,
which may be considered as a sponge filled with air, prevents the escape
of heat from the person wrapped in it. This seems to be one cause of the
great degree of cold on the tops of mountains, where the rarity of the
air is greater, and it therefore becomes a better conductor both of heat
and electricity. See note on Barometz, Vol. II. of this work.
There is however another cause to which the great coldness of mountains
and of the higher regions of the atmosphere is more immediately to be
ascribed, explained by Dr. Darwin in the Philos. Trans. Vol. LXXVIII.
who has there proved by experiments with the air-gun and air-pump, that
when any portion of the atmosphere becomes mechanically expanded, it
absorbs heat from the bodies in its vicinity. And as the air which
creeps along the plains, expands itself by a part of the pressure being
taken off when it ascends the sides of mountains; it at the same time
attracts heat from the summits of those mountains, or other bodies which
happen to be immersed in it, and thus produces cold. Hence he concludes
that the hot air at the bottom of the Andes becomes temperate by its own
rarefaction when it ascends to the city of Quito; and by its further
rarefaction becomes cooled to the freezing point when it ascends to the
snowy regions on the summits of those mountains. To this also he
attributes the great degree of cold experienced by the aeronauts in
their balloons; and which produces hail in summer at the height of only
believe from observation, that the twilight of the evenings is lighter
than that of the mornings at the same distance from noon. Some may
ascribe this to the greater height of the atmosphere in the evenings
having been rarefied by the sun during the day; but as its density must
at the same time be diminished, its power of refraction would continue
the same. I should rather suppose that it may be owing to the
phosphorescent quality (as it is called) of almost all bodies; that is,
when they have been exposed to the sun they continue to emit light for a
considerable time afterwards. This is generally believed to arise either
from such bodies giving out the light which they had previously
absorbed; or to the continuance of a slow combustion which the light
the phosphoric light, as it is called, which becomes visible on bodies
brought into a dark room, after having been previously exposed to the
sunshine. It appears from these experiments, that almost all inflammable
bodies possess this quality in a greater or less degree; white paper or
linen thus examined after having been exposed to the sunshine, is
luminous to an extraordinary degree; and if a person shut up in a dark
room, puts one of his hands out into the sun's light for a short time
and then retracts it, he will be able to see that hand distinctly and
not the other. These experiments seem to countenance the idea of light
being absorbed and again emitted from bodies when they are removed into
darkness. But Beccari further pretended, that some calcareous
compositions when exposed to red, yellow, or blue light, through
coloured glasses, would on their being brought into a dark room emit
coloured lights. This mistaken fact of Beccari's, Mr. Wilson decidedly
refutes; and among many other curious experiments discovered, that if
oyster-shells were thrown into a common fire and calcined for about half
an hour, and then brought to a person who had previously been some
minutes in a dark room, that many of them would exhibit beautiful irises
of prismatic colours, from whence probably arose Beccari's mistake. Mr.
Wilson from hence contends, that these kinds of phosphori do not emit
the light they had previously received, but that they are set on fire by
the sun's rays, and continue for some time a slow combustion after they
are withdrawn from the light. Wilson's Experiments on Phosphori.
Dodsley, 1775.
The Bolognian stone is a selenite, or gypsum, and has been long
celebrated for its phosphorescent quality after having been burnt in a
sulphurous fire; and exposed when cold to the sun's light. It may be
thus well imitated: Calcine oyster-shells half an hour, pulverize them
when cold, and add one third part of flowers of sulphur, press them
close into a small crucible, and calcine them for an hour or longer, and
keep the powder in a phial close stopped. A part of this powder is to be
exposed for a minute or two to the sunbeams, and then brought into a
dark room. The calcined Bolognian stone becomes a calcareous hepar of
sulphur; but the calcined shells, as they contain the animal acid, may

frequently alluded to by poets, is supposed to originate from the
inflammable air, or Hydrogene, given up from morasses; which being of a
heavier kind from its impurity than that obtained from iron and water,
hovers near the surface of the earth, and uniting with common air gives
out light by its slow ignition. Perhaps such lights have no existence,
and the reflection of a star on watery ground may have deceived the
travellers, who have been said to be bewildered by them? if the fact was
established it would much contribute to explain the phenomena of
northern lights. I have travelled much in the night, in all seasons of
the year, and over all kinds of soil, but never saw one of these Will
the river of Surinam in South America; those which were brought over to
England about eight years ago were about three or four feet long, and
gave an electric shock (as I experienced) by putting one finger on the
back near its head, and another of the opposite hand into the water near
its tail. In their native country they are said to exceed twenty feet in
length, and kill any man who approaches them in an hostile manner. It is
not only to escape its enemies that this surprizing power of the fish is
used, but also to take its prey; which it does by benumbing them and
then devouring them before they have time to recover, or by perfectly
killing them; for the quantity of the power seemed to be determined by
the will or anger of the animal; as it sometimes struck a fish twice
before it was sufficiently benumbed to be easily swallowed.
The organs productive of this wonderful accumulation of electric matter
have been accurately dissected and described by Mr. J. Hunter. Philos.
Trans. Vol. LXV. And are so divided by membranes as to compose a very
extensive surface, and are supplied with many pairs of nerves larger
than any other nerves of the body; but how so large a quantity is so
quickly accumulated as to produce such amazing effects in a fluid ill
adapted for the purpose is not yet satisfactorily explained. The Torpedo
possesses a similar power in a less degree, as was shewn by Mr. Walch,
and another fish lately described by Mr. Paterson. Philo. Trans. Vol.
In the construction of the Leyden-Phial, (as it is called) which is
coated on both sides, it is known, that above one hundred times the
quantity of positive electricity can be condensed on every square inch
of the coating on one side, than could have been accumulated on the same
surface if there had been no opposite coating communicating with the
earth; because the negative electricity, or that part of it which caused
its expansion, is now drawn off through the glass. It is also well
known, that the thinner the glass is (which is thus coated on both sides
so as to make a Leyden-phial, or plate) the more electricity can be
condensed on one of its surfaces, till it becomes so thin as to break,
and thence discharge itself.
Now it is possible, that the quantity of electricity condensible on one
side of a coated phial may increase in some high ratio in respect to the
thinness of the glass, since the power of attraction is known to
decrease as the squares of the distances, to which this circumstance of
electricity seems to bear some analogy. Hence if an animal membrane, as
thin as the silk-worm spins its silk, could be so situated as to be
charged like the Leyden bottle, without bursting, (as such thin glass
would be liable to do,) it would be difficult to calculate the immense
quantity of electric fluid, which might be accumulated on its surface.
No land animals are yet discovered which possess this power, though the
air would have been a much better medium for producing its effects;
perhaps the size of the necessary apparatus would have been inconvenient
V. 1. "NYMPHS! Your soft smiles uncultur'd man subdued,
You, while amazed his hurrying Hords retire
From the fell havoc of devouring FIRE,
Taught, the first Art! with piny rods to raise
By quick attrition the domestic blaze,
And lift the dread Destroyer on his side.
So, with bright wreath of serpent-tresses crown'd,
Severe in beauty, young MEDUSA frown'd;
Erewhile subdued, round WISDOM'S  Aegis roll'd
Flash'd on her brandish'd arm the immortal shield,
And Terror lighten'd o'er the dazzled field.
mankind seems to have been that of fire. For many ages it is probable
fire was esteemed a dangerous enemy, known only by its dreadful
devastations; and that many lives must have been lost, and many
dangerous burns and wounds must have afflicted those who first dared to
subject it to the uses of life. It is said that the tall monkies of
Borneo and Sumatra lie down with pleasure round any accidental fire in
their woods; and are arrived to that degree of reason, that knowledge of
causation, that they thrust into the remaining fire the half-burnt ends
of the branches to prevent its going out. One of the nobles of the
cultivated people of Otaheita, when Captain Cook treated them with tea,
catched the boiling water in his hand from the cock of the tea-urn, and
bellowed with pain, not conceiving that water could become hot, like red
fire.
Tools of steel constitute another important discovery in consequence of
fire; and contributed perhaps principally to give the European nations
so great superiority over the American world. By these two agents, fire
and tools of steel, mankind became able to cope with the vegetable
kingdom, and conquer provinces of forests, which in uncultivated
countries almost exclude the growth of other vegetables, and of those
animals which are necessary to our existence. Add to this, that the
quantity of our food is also increased by the use of fire, for some
vegetables become salutary food by means of the heat used in cookery,
which are naturally either noxious or difficult of digestion; as
potatoes, kidney-beans, onions, cabbages. The cassava when made into
bread, is perhaps rendered mild by the heat it undergoes, more than by
expressing its superfluous juice. The roots of white bryony and of arum,

countenance, which appears intensely thinking; and was supposed to
represent divine wisdom. The Grecian Medusa, on Minerva's shield, as
appears on other gems, has a countenance distorted with rage or pain,
and is supposed to represent divine vengeance. This Medusa was one of
the Gorgons, at first very beautiful and terrible to her enemies;
Minerva turned her hair into snakes, and Perseus having cut off her head
fixed it on the shield of that goddess; the sight of which then
And give new wonders to the Chemist's hand;
Or fix in sulphur all it's solid fire;
With boundless spring elastic airs unfold,
Or fill the fine vacuities of gold;
With sudden flash vitrescent sparks reveal,
Or mark with shining letter KUNKEL's name
In the pale Phosphor's self-consuming flame.
So the chaste heart of some enchanted Maid
Shines with insidious light, by Love betray'd;
And slow she wastes by self-consuming fire.
cannot be accounted for without the supposition, that some of the bodies
employed contain concentrated or solid heat combined with them, to which
the French Chemists have given the name of Calorique. When air is
expanded in the air-pump, or water evaporated into steam, they drink up
or absorb a great quantity of heat; from this analogy, when gunpowder is
exploded it ought to absorb much heat, that is, in popular language, it
ought to produce a great quantity of cold. When vital air is united with
phlogistic matter in respiration, which seems to be a slow combustion,
its volume is lessened; the carbonic acid, and perhaps phosphoric acid
are produced; and heat is given out; which according to the experiments
of Dr. Crawford would seem to be deposited from the vital air. But as
the vital air in nitrous acid is condensed from a light elastic gas to
that of a heavy fluid, it must possess less heat than before. And hence
a great part of the heat, which is given out in firing gunpowder, I
should suppose, must reside in the sulphur or charcoal.
Mr. Lavoisier has shewn, that vital air, or Oxygene, looses less of its
heat when it becomes one of the component parts of nitrous acid, than in
any other of its combinations; and is hence capable of giving out a
great quantity of heat in the explosion of gunpowder; but as there seems
to be great analogy between the matter of heat, or Calorique, and the
electric matter; and as the worst conductors of electricity are believed
to contain the greatest quantity of that fluid; there is reason to
suspect that the worst conductors of heat may contain the most of that
fluid; as sulphur, wax, silk, air, glass. See note on l. 174 of this

be an internal light, perhaps of electric origin, very different from
the ignited sparks which are struck from flint and steel. The sparks
