[Transcriber‚Äôs Note:

This e-text is based on the 1869 (second) edition of the _Poems_. A few
apparent misprints were checked against the 1864 edition, but the texts
as a whole were not closely compared.

The text includes characters that will only display in UTF-8 (Unicode)
text readers, primarily »ú »ù (yogh). There are also a few Greek words in
the Index, and a handful of letters with overline or macron, such as ƒ´.
If these characters do not display properly, or if the quotation marks
in this paragraph appear as garbage, make sure your text reader‚Äôs
‚Äúcharacter set‚Äù or ‚Äúfile encoding‚Äù is set to Unicode (UTF-8). You may
also need to change the default font. As a last resort, use the Latin-1
version of the file instead.

The book has been separated into six independent units, set off by
triple rows of asterisks:

  [1] Introductory Material
  [2] The Pearl
  [3] Cleanness
  [4] Patience
  [5] Glossarial Index (excluding Postscript)
  [6] Collected Sidenotes (section added by transcriber: editor‚Äôs
    sidenotes can be read as a condensed version of full text)

Each segment has its own footnotes and errata lists. Readers may choose
to divide them into separate files. The Notes were originally printed as
a short (12 pages) section before the Index. For this e-text they have
been distributed among their respective texts.

_Italics and other Text Markings:_

Bracketed letters are in the original.

Italicized letters within words, representing expanded abbreviations,
are shown in the e-text with braces (‚Äúcurly brackets‚Äù): co{n}nyng{e}.
Readers who find this added information distracting may globally delete
all braces _in the body text_; they are not used for any other purpose.
Italic markings were omitted from forms such as ‚ÄúFol. 51a.‚Äù where
the a or b was consistently italicized. Whole-word italics (in modern
editorial material only) are shown with _lines_.

In the Glossarial Index, groups of words in {braces} were printed on
consecutive lines, bracketed together. Text printed in small capitals
is shown in +marks+.

_Page Layout:_

The HTML version of this e-text offers a closer approximation of the
original page layout.

_Footnotes_ were numbered separately for each page. In this e-text,
footnotes are numbered sequentially within each text and grouped at
the end of each stanza (_The Pearl_) or section (_Cleanness_ and
_Patience_), or each subsection of the Preface. Numbered notes printed
in the side margin were treated as footnotes.

_Headnotes_ from the top of each page have been moved to the most
appropriate sentence break. They are also grouped at the beginning of
each selection to act as a detailed table of contents.

_Sidenotes_ were added by the editor to give translations or summaries.
In this e-text, they are collected into full sentences, and generally
appear immediately _before_ their original location. In _The Pearl_,
sidenotes are grouped at the beginning of each twelve-line stanza.
Sidenotes in the form [Fol. 10b] are shown in the same way as general
sidenotes. They always come directly above the relevant line or its
sidenotes, if any.

_Orphaned Quotation Marks_ are listed separately in each Errata section.
In some cases it may be possible to guess where the missing quotation
mark belongs, but it seemed safer to leave the text as printed. No
quotation marks disappeared between the 1864 and 1869 editions.]

PREFACE.


The following poems are taken from a well known manuscript in the
Cottonian collection, marked Nero A. x, which also contains, in the same
handwriting and dialect, a metrical romance,[1] wherein the adventures
of Sir Gawayne with the ‚ÄúKnight in Green,‚Äù are most ably and
interestingly described.

Unfortunately nothing can be affirmed with any certainty concerning the
authorship of these most valuable and interesting compositions. The
editor of ‚ÄúSyr Gawayn and the Green Knight‚Äù considers that Huchowne, a
supposed[2] Scotch _maker_ of the fourteenth century, has the best
claims to be recognised as the author, inasmuch as he is specially
referred to by Wyntown as the writer of the _Gret gest of Arthure_ and
the _Awntyre of Gawayne_.

I do not think that any certain conclusions are to be drawn from the
Scotch historian‚Äôs assertion. It is well known that more versifiers than
one during the fourteenth century attempted romance composition in the
English language, having for their theme the knightly deeds of Arthur or
Sir Gawayne. These they compiled from French originals, from which they
selected the most striking incidents and those best suited to an
Englishman‚Äôs taste for the marvellous. We are not surprised, then, at
finding so many romance poems treating of the exploits of the same hero,
and laying claim to be considered as original productions. In Scotland,
Huchowne‚Äôs works might no doubt have been regarded as the standard
romances of the period, but that they were the only English _gests_ is
indeed very doubtful.

The Early English alliterative romance, entitled the _Morte Arthure_,
published from a manuscript in Lincoln Cathedral by Mr. Halliwell,[3] is
considered by Sir F. Madden to be the veritable _gest of Arthure_
composed by Huchowne. An examination of this romance does not lead me to
the same conclusion, unless Huchowne was a Midland man, for the poem is
not written in the old Scotch dialect,[4] but seems to have been
originally composed in one of the Northumbrian dialects spoken _South_
of the Tweed.[5]

The manuscript from which Mr. Halliwell has taken his text is not the
original copy, nor even a literal transcript of it. It exhibits certain
orthographical and grammatical peculiarities unknown to the Northumbrian
dialect which have been introduced by a Midland transcriber, who has
here and there taken the liberty to adapt the original text to the
dialect of his own locality, probably that one of the North Midland
counties, where many of the Northumbrian forms of speech would be
intelligible.[6]

A comparison of the Arthurian romance with the following poems throws no
light whatever upon the authorship of the poems. The dialect of the two
works is altogether different, although many of the terms employed are
common to both, being well known over the whole of the North of England.
The grammatical forms (the best test we can have) in the poems are quite
distinct from those in the _Morte Arthure_, and of course go far to
prove that they do not proceed from the pen of the same writer.

The Editor of ‚ÄúSyr Gawayn and the Green Knight‚Äù acknowledges that the
poems in the present volume, as now preserved to us in the manuscript,
are not in the Scottish dialect, but he says ‚Äúthere is sufficient
internal evidence of their being _Northern_,[7] although the manuscript
containing them appears to have been written by a scribe of the Midland
counties, which will account for the introduction of forms differing
from those used by writers beyond the Tweed.‚Äù

Now, with regard to this subsequent transcription of the poems from the
Scotch into a Midland dialect,--it cannot be said to be improbable, for
we have abundant instances of the multiplication of copies by scribes of
different localities, so that we are not surprised at finding the works
of some of our popular Early English writers appearing in two or three
forms; but, on the other hand, a comparison of the original copy with
the _adapted transcriptions_, or even the reading of a transcribed copy,
always shows how the author‚Äôs productions have suffered by the change.
Poetical works, especially those with final rhymes, of course undergo
the greatest amount of transformation and depreciation. The changes
incident upon the kind of transcription referred to are truly
surprising, and most perplexing to those who make the subject of Early
English _dialects_ a matter of investigation.

But, in the present poems, the uniformity and consistency of the
grammatical forms is so entire, that there is indeed no internal
evidence of subsequent transcription into any other dialect than that in
which they were originally written. However, the dialect and grammatical
peculiarities will be considered hereafter.

Again, in the course of transcription into another dialect, any literary
merit that the author‚Äôs copy may have originally possessed would
certainly be destroyed. But the poems before us are evidently the work
of a man of birth and education; the productions of a true poet, and of
one who had acquired a perfect mastery over that form of the English
tongue spoken in his own immediate locality during the earlier part of
the fourteenth century. Leaving out of consideration their great
philological worth, they possess an intrinsic value of their own as
literary compositions, very different from anything to be found in the
works of Robert of Gloucester, Manning, and many other Early English
authors, which are very important as philological records, but in the
light of poetical productions, cannot be said to hold a very
distinguished place in English literature. The poems in the present
volume contain many passages which, as Sir F. Madden truly remarks, will
bear comparison with any similar ones in the works of Douglas or
Spenser.

I conclude, therefore, that these poems were not transcribed from the
Scotch dialect into any other, but were written in their own
West-Midland speech in which we now have them.

Mr. Donaldson, who is now editing for the Early English Text Society the
Troy Book, translated from Guido di Colonna, puts forward a plea for
Huchowne as its author, to whom he would also assign the _Morte Arthure_
(ed. Perry) and the Pistel of Sweet Susan.[8] But Mr. Donaldson seems to
have been misled by the similarity of vocabulary, which is not at all a
safe criterion in judging of works written in a Northumbrian, West or
East Midland speech. The dialect, I venture to think, is a far safer
test. A careful examination of the Troy Book compels me to differ in
toto from Mr. Donaldson, and, instead of assigning the Troy Book to a
Scotchman, say that it cannot even be claimed, in its present form, by
any Northumbrian south of the Tweed; moreover, it presents no appearance
of having been tampered with by one unacquainted with the dialect,
though it has perhaps been slightly modernised in the course of
transcription.

The work is evidently a genuine West-Midland production,[9] having most
of the peculiarities of vocabulary and inflexions that are found in
these _Alliterative Poems_.[10] I feel greatly inclined to claim this
English Troy Book as the production of the author of the _Alliterative
Poems_; for, leaving out identical and by no means common expressions,
we find the same power of description,[11] and the same tendency to
inculcate moral and religious truths on all occasions where an
opportunity presents itself.[12] Without dwelling upon this topic, which
properly falls to the Editor of the Troy Book, it may not be out of
place to ask the reader to compare the following description of a storm
from the Troy Book, with that selected from the present volume on pp. 14
and 18.


A TEMPEST ON √ûE SEE.

    There a tempest _hom_ toke on √æe torres hegh:--
    A _rak_ and a royde wynde rose in _hor_ saile,
    A myst & a _merkenes_ was mervell to se;
    With a _routond_ rayn ruthe to be-holde,
    Thonr{et}[13] full _throly_ with a thicke haile;
    With a leuenyng light as a _low_ fyre,
    Blas{et} all the brode see as it bren wold.
    The flode with a felle cours flow{et} on hepis,
    Rose uppon rockes as any _ranke_ hylles.
    So wode were the waghes & √æe wilde _ythes_,
    All was like to be lost √æat no lond hade
    The ship ay shot furth o √æe _shire waghes_,
    As qwo clymbe at a clyffe, or a clent[14] hille.
    Eft _dump_ in the depe as all drowne wolde.
    Was no _stightlyng_ with stere ne no stithe ropes,
    Ne no sayle, √æat might serue for _unsound_ wedur.
  But all the buernes in the bote, as _hom_ best liked,
  Besoght unto sainttes & to sere goddes; (p.¬†65)


A STORME ON THE SE.

  All the company enclin{et} cair{yn} to ship;
  Cach{yn} in cables, knyt up _hor_ ancres,
  Sesit vp _hor_ sailes in a sad hast;
  _Richet_ √æere rapes, rapit unto see.
  Hokit out of hauyn, all the hepe somyn,
  _Hade bir at hor bake_, blawen to √æe depe;
  Sail{yn} forthe _soberly_, somyn but a while,
  Noght fyftene forlong fairly to the end.
    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  When sodenly the softe aire _unsoberly_ rose;
  The cloudis overcast, _claterrit_ aboute;
  Wyndes full wodely _walt_ up the ythes;
  Wex _merke_ as the mydnighte mystes full thicke:
  Thunret in the _thestur throly_ with all;
  With a _launchant laite_ lightonyd the water;
  And a _ropand_ rayne _raiked_ fro the heuyn.
  The storme was full stithe with mony stout windes,
  Hit _walt_ up the wilde se vppon wan hilles.
  The ffolke was so ferd, that _on flete_ were,
  All drede for to drowne with dryft of the se;
  And in perell were put all the proude kynges. --(p.¬†150.)

    under the title of ‚ÄúSyr Gawayn and the Grene Kny»ùt,‚Äù and by me for
    the Early English Text Soc., 1865.]

    [Footnote 2: Wyntown nowhere asserts that Huchowne is a
    Scotchman.]

    [Footnote 3: Edited for E. E. T. Soc. by Rev. G. G. Perry, M.A.]

    [Footnote 4: This is evident from the following particulars:--

    I. In old Scotch manuscripts we find the guttural _gh_ (or »ù)
    represented by _ch_; thus, _aght_, _laght_, _saght_, _wight_, are
    the English forms which, in the Scotch orthography, become _aucht_
    (owed), _laucht_ (seized), _saucht_ (peace), _wicht_ (active). It
    is the former orthography, however, that prevails in the Morte
    Arthure.

    II. We miss the Scotch use of (1) _-is_ or _-ys_, for _-es_ or
    _-s_, in the plural number, and of possessive cases of nouns, and
    in the person endings of the present tense indicative mood of
    verbs; (2) _-it_ or _-yt_, for _-ed_ or _-d_, in the preterites or
    passive participles of regular verbs.

    III. There is a total absence of the well-known Scotch forms
    _begouth_ (began), _sa_ (so), _sic_ (such), _throuch_, _thorow_
    (through). Instead of these _bigan_, _so_, _syche_, _thrughe_
    (_thurgh_) are employed. See Preface to Hampole‚Äôs Pricke of
    Conscience, pp. vii, viii.]

    [Footnote 5: This is shown by the frequent employment of _-es_ as
    the person ending of the verb in the present tense, plural number.
    The corresponding Southern verbal inflexion _-eth_ _never_ occurs;
    while the Midland _-en_ is only occasionally met with in the third
    person plural present, and has been introduced by a later copyist.
    There are other characteristics, such as the predominance of words
    containing the A.S. long _a_; as _hame_ (home), _stane_ (stone),
    _thra_ (bold), _walde_ (would), etc.; the frequent use of _thir_
    (these), _tha_ (the, those), etc.]

    [Footnote 6: The peculiarities referred to do not appear to be
    owing to the copyist of the Lincoln manuscript (Robert de
    Thornton, a native of Oswaldkirk in Yorkshire), who, being a
    Northumbrian, would probably have restored the original readings.
    The non-Northumbrian forms in the Morte Arthure are-- 1.¬†The
    change of _a_ into _o_, as _bolde_ for _balde_, _bote_ for _bate_,
    _one_ for _ane_, _honde_ for _hande_, _londe_ for _lande_;
    2.¬†_they_, _theyre_, _them_, _theym_, for _thay_, _thaire_,
    _tham_; 3.¬†_gayliche_, _kindliche_, _semlyche_, etc., for _gayly_,
    _kindly_, _seemly_, etc. (the termination _lich_, _liche_, was
    wholly unknown to the Northumbrian dialect, being represented by
    _ly_ or _like_); 4.¬†_churle_, _churche_, _iche_, _mache_, _myche_,
    _syche_, _wyrche_, etc., for _carle_, _kirke_, _ilk_, _make_,
    _mykelle_, _swilk_, _wyrk_, etc.; 5.¬†infinitives in _-en_, as
    _drenschen_, _schewenne_, _wacchenne_, etc.; 6.¬†the use of _eke_,
    _thos_, for _als_ (_alswa_), _thas_; 7.¬†the employment of _aye_
    for _egg_. The former word _never_ occurs in any pure Northumbrian
    work, while the latter is seldom met with in any Southern
    production.]

    [Footnote 7: The poems are _Northern_ in contradistinction to
    _Southern_, but they are not Northern or Northumbrian in
    contradistinction to _Midland_.]

    Cotton Calig. A. ii.; the latter imperfect.]

    [Footnote 9: Other specimens of this dialect will doubtless turn
    up. Mr. Brock has found a MS. in British Museum (Harl. 3909) with
    most of the peculiarities pointed out by me in the preface to the
    present work, and I believe that this dialect was probably a
    flourishing one in the 13th century. See O.E. Homilies, p.¬†li.]

    [Footnote 10: (1) _en_ as the inflexion of the pres. tense pl.,
    indic. mood of verbs; (2) _s_ in the second and third pers. sing.

    (6)¬†_de»ùter_ = daughters, etc.]

    [Footnote 13: In the Harl. MS. 3909, nearly all the p.¬†part. and
    preterites end in _-et_ (_-ut_ and _-et_ occur in Romances ed. by

    [Footnote 14: This seems to furnish an etymology for _Clent_
    Hills, Worcestershire--_brent_ is the term employed in
    Alliterative.]


The poems in the present volume, three in number, seem to have been
written for the purpose of enforcing, by line upon line and precept upon
precept, Resignation to the will of God; Purity of life as manifested in
thought, word, and deed; Obedience to the Divine command; and Patience
under affliction.

In the first poem, entitled by me ‚Äú_The Pearl_‚Äù, the author evidently
gives expression to his own sorrow for the loss of his infant child, a
girl of two years old, whom he describes as a

  Perle plesaunte to prynces paye
  _Pearl pleasant to princes‚Äô pleasure,_
  To clanly clos in golde so clere
  _Most neatly set in gold so clear._

Of her death he says:

  Allas! I leste hyr in on erbere
  _Alas! I lost her in an arbour,_
  √ûur»ù gresse to grounde hit fro me yot
  _Through grass to ground it from me got._ --(p.¬†1.)

The writer then represents himself as visiting his child‚Äôs grave (or
arbour) in the ‚Äúhigh season of August,‚Äù and giving way to his grief
(p.¬†2). He falls asleep, and in a dream is carried toward a forest,
where he saw rich rocks gleaming gloriously, hill sides decked with
crystal cliffs, and trees the leaves of which were as burnished silver.
The gravel under his feet was ‚Äúprecious pearls of orient,‚Äù and birds ‚Äúof
flaming hues‚Äù flew about in company, whose notes were far sweeter than
those of the cytole or gittern (guitar) (p.¬†3). The dreamer arrives at
the bank of a stream, which flows over stones (shining like stars in the
welkin on a winter‚Äôs night) and pebbles of emeralds, sapphires, or other
precious gems, so

  √ûat all the lo»ùe lemed of ly»ùt
  _That all the deep gleamed of light,_
  So dere wat»ù hit adubbement
  _So dear was its adornment._ --(p.¬†4.)

Following the course of the stream, he perceives on the opposite side a
crystal cliff, from which was reflected many a ‚Äúroyal ray‚Äù (p.¬†5).

  At √æe fote √æer-of √æer sete a faunt
  _At the foot thereof there sat a child,_
  A mayden of menske, ful debonere
  _A maiden of honour, full debonnair;_
  Blysnande whyt wat»ù hyr bleaunt
  _Glistening white was her robe,_
  (I knew hyr wel, I hade sen hyr ere)
  _(I knew her well, I had seen her before)_
  At glysnande golde √æat man con schore
  _As shining gold that man did purify,_
  So schon √æat schene an-vnder schore
  _So shone that sheen (bright one) on the opposite shore;_
  On lenghe I loked to hyr √æere
  _Long I looked to her there,_
  √ûe lenger I knew hyr more & more
  _The longer I knew her, more and more._ --(pp. 6, 7.)

The maiden rises, and, proceeding along the bank of the stream,
approaches him. He tells her that he has done nothing but mourn for the
loss of his Pearl, and has been indeed a ‚Äújoyless jeweller‚Äù (p.¬†8).
However, now that he has found his Pearl, he declares that he is no
longer sorrowful, but would be a ‚Äújoyful jeweller‚Äù were he allowed to
cross the stream (p.¬†8). The maiden blames her father for his rash
speech, tells him that his Pearl is not lost, and that he cannot pass
the stream till after death (p.¬†10). The dreamer is in great grief; he
does not, he says, care what may happen if he is again to lose his
Pearl. The maiden advises him to bear his loss patiently, and to abide
God‚Äôs doom (p.¬†11). She describes to him her blissful state in heaven,
where she reigns as a queen (p.¬†12). She explains to him that Mary is
the Empress of Heaven, and all others kings and queens (p.¬†13). The
parable of the labourers in the vineyard[15] (pp. 15-18) is then
rehearsed at length, to prove that ‚Äúinnocents‚Äù are admitted to the same
privileges as are enjoyed by those who have lived longer upon the earth
(p.¬†18). The maiden then speaks to her father of Christ and his one
hundred and forty thousand brides (p.¬†24), and describes their blissful
state (p.¬†26). She points out to him the heavenly Jerusalem, which was
‚Äúall of bright burnished gold, gleaming like glass‚Äù (p.¬†29). Then the
dreamer beholds a procession of virgins going to salute the Lamb, among
whom he perceives his ‚Äúlittle queen‚Äù (p.¬†33). On attempting to cross the
stream to follow her, he is aroused from his dream (p.¬†35), laments his
rash curiosity in seeking to know so much of God‚Äôs mysteries, and
declares that man ever desires more happiness than he has any right to
expect (p.¬†35).

    [Footnote 15: Matthew, chapter xx.]


The second poem, entitled ‚Äú_Cleanness_,‚Äù is a collection of Biblical
stories, in which the writer endeavours to enforce Purity of Life, by
showing how greatly God is displeased at every kind of impurity, and how
sudden and severe is the punishment which falls upon the sinner for
every violation of the Divine law.

After commending cleanness and its ‚Äúfair forms,‚Äù the author relates (I.)
The Parable of the Marriage Feast (p.¬†39); (II.) the Fall of the Angels
(p. 43); (III.) The wickedness of the antediluvian world (p.¬†44),

  He wat»ù famed for fre √æat fe»ùt loued best
  _He was famous as free that fight loved best,_
  & ay √æe bigest in bale √æe best wat»ù halden
  _And ever the biggest in sin the best was held;_ (p.¬†45.)

(IV.) The destruction of mankind by the Flood. When all were safely
stowed in the ark,

  Thenne sone com √æe seuen√æe day, when samned wern alle
  _Then soon came the seventh day when assembled were all,_
  & alle woned in √æe whichche √æe wylde & √æe tame.
  _And all abode in the ark (hutch), the wild and the tame._
  √ûen bolned √æe abyme & bonke»ù con ryse
  _Then swelled the abyss and banks did rise,_
  Waltes out vch walle-heued, in ful wode streme»ù
  _Bursts out each well-head in full wild streams,_
  Wat»ù no brymme √æat abod vnbrosten bylyue
  _There was no brim (stream) that abode unburst by then,_
  √ûe mukel lauande loghe to √æe lyfte rered
  _The much (great) flowing deep (loch) to the loft (sky) reared._
  Mony clustered clowde clef alle in clowte»ù
  _Many a clustering cloud cleft all in clouts (pieces),_
  To-rent vch a rayn-ryfte & rusched to √æe vr√æe
  _Rent was each a rain-rift and rushed to the earth;_

  _Failed never in forty days, and then the flood rises,_
  Ouer-walte»ù vche a wod and √æe wyde felde»ù
  _Over-flows each wood and the wide fields;_
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

  _Water wildly ever waxed, abodes that destroyed,_

The third poem, entitled ‚Äú_Patience_,‚Äù is a paraphrase of the book of
Jonah. The writer prefaces it with a few remarks of his own in order to
show that ‚Äúpatience is a noble point though it displease oft.‚Äù

The following extract contains a description of the sea-storm which
overtook Jonah:--

  Anon out of √æe nor√æ est √æe noys bigynes
  _Anon out of the north east the noise begins,_
  When bo√æe bre√æes[20] con blowe vpon blo watteres
  _When both breezes did blow upon blue waters:_
  Ro»ù rakkes √æer ros with rudnyng an-vnder
  _Rough clouds there arose with lightning there under,_

  _The sea sobbed full sore, great marvel to hear;_
  √ûe wyndes on √æe wonne water so wrastel togeder,
  _The winds on the wan water so wrestle together,_
  √ûat √æe wawes ful wode waltered so hi»ùe
  _That the waves full wild rolled so high,_
  & efte busched to √æe abyme √æat breed fyssches
  _And again bent to the abyss that bred fishes;_
  Durst nowhere for ro»ù arest at √æe bothem.
  _Durst it nowhere for roughness rest at the bottom._
  When √æe breth & √æe brok & √æe bote metten
  _When the breeze and the brook and the boat met,_
  Hit wat»ù a ioyles gyn √æat Ionas wat»ù inne
  _It was a joyless engine that Jonah was in,_
  For hit reled on round vpon √æe ro»ùe y√æes
  _For it reeled around upon the rough waves._
  √ûe bur ber to hit baft √æat braste alle her gere
  _The bore (wave) bear to it abaft that burst all her gear,_
  √ûen hurled on a hepe √æe helme & √æe sterne
  _Then hurled on a heap the helm and the stern,_
  Furste to murte[21] mony rop & √æe mast after
  _First marred[21] many a rope and the mast after._
  √ûe sayl sweyed on √æe see, √æenne suppe bihoued
  _The sail swung on the sea, then sup behoved_
  √ûe coge of √æe colde water, & √æenne √æe cry ryses
  _The boat of the cold water, and then the cry rises;_
  »úet coruen √æay √æe cordes & kest al √æer-oute
  _Yet cut they the cords and cast all there-out._
  Mony ladde √æer forth-lep to laue & to kest
  _Many a lad there forth leapt to lave and to cast,_
  Scopen out √æe sca√æel water, √æat fayn scape wolde
  _To scoop out the scathful water that fain escape would;_
  For be monnes lode neuer so lu√æer, √æe lyf is ay swete
  _For be man‚Äôs lot never so bad, the life is aye sweet._ --(p.¬†93.)

The writer, in concluding the story of Jonah, exhorts his readers to be
‚Äúpatient in pain and in joy.‚Äù

  For he √æat is to rakel to renden his clo√æe»ù,
  Mot efte sitte with more vn-sounde to sewe hem togeder.
  _For he that is too rash to rend his clothes,
  Must afterwards sit with more unsound (worse ones)
      to sew them together._ (p.¬†104.)

    [Footnote 20: Eurus and Aquilo.]

    [Footnote 21: ? = to-marte.]


This brief outline of the poems, together with the short extracts from
them, will, it is hoped, give the reader stomach to digest the whole. It
is true that they contain many ‚Äúuncouth‚Äù terms; but this will be their
highest merit with the student of language, as is shown, by Dr. Guest‚Äôs
testimony, that they are ‚Äúfor several reasons curious, and especially so
to the philologist.‚Äù[22] To those readers who do not appreciate the
importance of such a very large addition to the vocabulary of our Early
Language as is made by these treatises, let Sir Frederic Madden‚Äôs
opinion of their literary merit suffice. That distinguished editor says,
of the author‚Äôs ‚Äúpoetical talent, the pieces contained in the MS. afford
unquestionable proofs; and the description of the change of the seasons,
the bitter aspect of winter, the tempest which preceded the destruction
of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the sea storm occasioned by the wickedness of
Jonas, _are equal to any similar passages_ in Douglas or Spenser.‚Äù[23]
Moreover, as to the hardness of the language--inasmuch as the subject
matter of the poem will be familiar to all who may take up the present
volume, the difficulty on the word-point will not be such as to deter
the reader from understanding and appreciating the production of an old
English poet, who--though his very name, unfortunately, has yet to be
discovered--may claim to stand in the foremost rank of England‚Äôs early
bards.

The Editor of the present volume has endeavoured to do justice to his
author by giving the text, with some few exceptions, as it stands in the
manuscript.[24] The contractions of the scribe have been expanded and
printed in italics, a plan which he hopes to see adopted in every future
edition of an early English author.

The Glossary has been compiled not only for the benefit of the reader,
but for the convenience of those who are studying the older forms of our
language, and who know how valuable a mere index of words and references
sometimes proves.

In conclusion, I take the present opportunity of acknowledging the kind
assistance of Sir Frederic Madden and E.¬†A. Bond, Esq., of the British
Museum, who, on every occasion, were most ready to render me any help in
deciphering the manuscript, in parts almost illegible, from which the
poems in the present volume are printed.

REMARKS UPON THE DIALECT AND GRAMMAR.

Higden, writing about the year A.D. 1350, affirms, distinctly, the
existence of three different forms of speech or dialects, namely,
Southern, Midland, and Northern;[25] or, as they are sometimes
designated, West-Saxon, Mercian, and Northumbrian. Garnett objects to
Higden‚Äôs classification, and considers it certain ‚Äúthat there were in
his (Higden‚Äôs) time, and probably long before, five distinctly marked
forms, which may be classed as follows:-- 1.¬†Southern or standard
English, which in the fourteenth century was perhaps best spoken in Kent
and Surrey by the body of the inhabitants. 2.¬†Western English, of which
traces may be found from Hampshire to Devonshire, and northward as far
as the Avon. 3.¬†Mercian, vestiges of which appear in Shropshire,
Staffordshire, and South and West Derbyshire, becoming distinctly marked
in Cheshire, and still more so in South Lancashire. 4.¬†Anglian, of which
there are three sub-divisions--the East Anglian of Norfolk and Suffolk;
the Middle Anglian of Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and East Derbyshire;
and the North Anglian of the West Riding of Yorkshire--spoken most
purely in the central part of the mountainous district of Craven.
5.¬†Northumbrian,‚Äù spoken throughout the Lowlands of Scotland,
Northumberland, Durham, and nearly the whole of Yorkshire.

Garnett‚Äôs division is based upon peculiarities of pronunciation, which
will be found well marked in the _modern_ provincial dialects, and not
upon any essential differences of inflexion that are to be found in our
Early English manuscripts.[26]

The distinction between Southern and Western English was not at all
required, as the Kentish Ayenbite of Inwyt (A.D. 1340) exhibits most of
the peculiarities that mark the Chronicles of Robert of Gloucester
(Cottonian MS. Calig. A. xi.) as a Southern (or West-Saxon) production.
The Anglian of Norfolk, Lincolnshire, and Nottinghamshire may be
referred to one group with the Mercian of Lancashire, as varieties of
the Midland dialect.

A careful examination of our early literature leads us to adopt Higden‚Äôs
classification as not only a convenient but a correct one.

There is, perhaps, no better test for distinguishing these dialects from
one another than the verbal inflexions of the plural number in the
present tense, indicative mood.

To state this test in the briefest manner, we may say that the Southern
dialect employs _-eth_, the Midland _-en_, and the Northumbrian _-es_ as
the inflexion for all persons of the plural present indicative:[27]--

              Southern.   Midland.   Northern.

  1st pers.   Hop-_eth_.  Hop-_en_.  Hop-_es_.  (we) hope.
  2nd  ‚Äû      Hop-_eth_.  Hop-_en_.  Hop-_es_.  (ye) hope.
  3rd  ‚Äû      Hop-_eth_.  Hop-_en_.  Hop-_es_.  (they) hope.

It is the constant and systematic employment of these inflexions, and
not their occasional use that must be taken as the criterion of
dialectical varieties.

In a pure specimen of the Southern dialect, we never find the
Northumbrian _-es_. We do occasionally meet with the Midland _-en_, but
only in those works written in localities where, from their geographical
position, Southern and Midland forms would be intelligible.[28] We might
look in vain for the Southern plural _-eth_ in a pure Northumbrian
production, but might be more successful in finding the Midland _-en_ in
the third person plural; as, ‚Äúthay _arn_‚Äù for ‚Äúthey _ar_‚Äù, or ‚Äúthay
_er_.‚Äù

In a work composed in Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, or Lancashire, we
should be sure to find the occasional use of the Northumbrian plural
_-es_.[29]

The inflexions of the verb in the singular are of value in enabling us
to discriminate between the several varieties of the Midland
dialect.[30] The Southern and Midland idioms (with the exception of the
West-Midland of Lancashire, Cheshire, etc.) conjugated the verb in the
singular present indicative, as follows:--

  1st pers.  hope            (I) hope.
  2nd  ‚Äû     hop-_est_  (thou) hopest.
  3rd  ‚Äû     hop-_eth_  (he) hopes.

The West-Midland, corresponding to Garnett‚Äôs Mercian, instead of _-est_
and _-eth_ employs the inflexions that are so common in the so-called
Northumbrian documents of the ninth and tenth centuries:--

  1st pers.  hope      (I) hope.
  2nd  ‚Äû     hop-_es_  (thou) hopest.
  3rd  ‚Äû     hop-_es_  (he) hopes.

The Northumbrian dialect takes _-es_ in all three persons; but mostly
drops it in the first person.

The peasantry of Cheshire and Lancashire still preserve the verbal
inflexions which prevailed in the fourteenth century, and conjugate
their verbs in the present indicative according to the following
model:--

             Singular.  Plural.
  1st pers.  hope       hopen.
  2nd  ‚Äû     hopes      hopen.
  3rd  ‚Äû     hopes      hopen.

Inasmuch as the poems in the present volume exhibit the systematic use
of these forms, we cannot but believe that they were originally composed
in one of those counties where these verbal inflexions were well known
and extensively used. We have to choose between several localities, but
if we assign the poems to Lancashire we are enabled to account for the
large number of Norse terms employed. It is true that the ancient
examples of the Lancashire dialect contained in Mr. Robson‚Äôs Metrical
Romances,[31] the Boke of Curtasye,[32] and Liber Cure Cocorum,[33]
present us with much broader forms, as _-us_ for _-es_ in the plural
number and possessive case of nouns, _-un_ for _-en_ in the plural
present indicative mood, in passive participles of irregular (or strong)
verbs, _-ud_ (_-ut_) for _-ed_ in the past tense and passive participle
of regular (or weak) verbs, and the pronominal forms _hor_ (their),
_hom_ (them), for _her_ and _hem_.[34]

These forms are evidence of a broad pronunciation which, at the present
time, is said to be a characteristic of the northwestern division of
Lancashire, but I think that there is good evidence for asserting that
this strong provincialism was not confined, formerly, to the
West-Midland dialect, much less to a division of any particular county.
We find traces of it in Audelay‚Äôs Poems (Shropshire), the Romance of
William and the Werwolf,[35] and even in the Wickliffite version of the
Scriptures.

Formerly, being influenced by these broad forms, I was led to select
Cheshire or Staffordshire as the probable locality where the poems were
written; but I do not, now, think that either of these counties ever
employed a vocabulary containing so many Norse terms as are to be found
in the Lancashire dialect. But although we may not be able to fix, with
certainty, upon any one county in particular, the fact of the present
poems being composed in the West-Midland dialect cannot be denied. Much
may be said in favour of their Lancashire origin, and there are one or
two points of resemblance between our poems, the Lancashire Romances,
and Liber Cure Cocorum, that deserve especial notice.

I. In Sir Amadace,[36] lxviii. 9, there occurs the curious form _mi»ùtus_
= _mi»ùtes_ = _mightst_.[37] As it appears only once throughout the
Romances we might conclude that it is an error of the scribe for
_mi»ùtest_, but when we find in the poems before us not only _my»ùte»ù_ =
_my»ùtes_ (mightst), but _wolde»ù_ = _woldes_ (wouldst), _couthe»ù_ =
_couthes_ (couldst), _dippte»ù_ (dippedest), _travaylede»ù_ (travelledst),
etc., we are bound to consider _mi»ùtus_ as a genuine form.[38] In no
other Early English works of the fourteenth century have I been able to
find this peculiarity. It is very common in _the Wohunge of Ure Lauerd_
(xiiith cent.). See O.E. Homilies, p.¬†51. The Northumbrian dialect at
this period rejected the inflexion in the second person preterite
singular, of regular verbs,[39] and in our poems we find the _-es_ often
dropped, so that we get two conjugations, which may be called the
inflected and the uninflected form.

             Inflected.  Uninflected.
  1st pers.  hopede      hoped         (I) hoped.
  2nd  ‚Äû     hoped_es_   hoped         (thou) hopedest.
  3rd  ‚Äû     hopede      hoped         (he) hoped.

Originally the inflected form may have prevailed over the whole of the
North of England, but have gradually become confined to the West-Midland
dialect.

II. The next point of resemblance is the use of the verb SCHIN or SCHUN
= schal = shall. It is still preserved in the modern dialect of
Lancashire in combination with the adverb _not_, as schunnot[40] = shall
not. The following examples will serve to illustrate the use of this
curious form:--

  ‚Äú---- √æay _schin_ knawe sone,
  √ûere is no bount√© in burne lyk Balta»ùar √æewes.‚Äù[41] --(B. l.¬†1435.)

  ‚Äú& √æose √æat seme arn & swete _schyn_ se his face.‚Äù[42]
      --(_Ibid._ l.¬†1810.)

  ‚ÄúPekokys and pertrikys perboylyd _schyn_ be.‚Äù[43]
      --(Liber Cure Cocorum, p.¬†29.)

  ‚ÄúFor √æer bene bestes √æat _schyn_ be rost.‚Äù[44] --(_Ibid._ p.¬†34.)

  ‚ÄúAlle _schun_ be dra»ùun, Syr, at √æo syde.‚Äù[45] --(_Ibid._ p.¬†35.)

  ‚ÄúSeche ferlies _schyn_ falle.‚Äù[46]
      --(Robson‚Äôs Met. Rom. p.¬†12, l.¬†4.)

III. Nothing is more common in the present poems than the use of _hit_
as a genitive = its, which is also found in the Lancashire romances.

  ‚ÄúFor√æy √æe derk dede see hit is demed ever more,
  For _hit_ dede»ù of de√æe duren √æere »ùet.‚Äù[47] --(Patience, l.¬†1021.)

  ‚ÄúAnd, as hit is corsed of kynde & _hit_ cooste»ù als,
  √ûe clay √æat clenges √æer-by arn corsyes strong.‚Äù[48]
      --(_Ibid._ l.¬†1033.)

  ‚ÄúFor I wille speke with the sprete,
  And of _hit_ woe wille I wete,
  Gif that I may _hit_ bales bete.‚Äù[49]
      --(Robson‚Äôs Met. Romances, p.¬†5, ll. 3, 4.)

The present dialect of Lancashire still retains the uninflected
genitive:--

  ‚ÄúSo I geet up be strike o‚Äô dey, on seet eawt; on went ogreath tilly
  welly coom within two mile oth‚Äô teawn; when, os tha dule woud
  height, o tit wur stonning ot an ale heawse dur; on me kawve (the
  dule bore eawt _it_ een for me) took th‚Äô tit for _it_ mother, on
  woud seawk her.‚Äù[50] (Tummus and Meary).

Thus much for the dialectical peculiarities of our author. The scanty
material at our disposal must be a sufficient excuse for the very meagre
outline which is here presented to the reader. As our materials
increase, the whole question of Early English dialects will no doubt
receive that attention from English philologists which the subject
really demands, and editors of old English works will then be enabled to
speak with greater confidence as to the language and peculiarities of
their authors. Something might surely be done to help the student by a
proper classification of our manuscripts both as to date and place of
composition. We are sadly in want of unadulterated specimens of the
Northumbrian and East-Midland idioms during the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. There must surely be some records of these dialects in our
university libraries which would well repay editing.[51]

    of the Midland, and the _-es_ of the Northumbrian is frequently

    with, as it presents us with no uniform type; and, moreover, works
    written in this idiom are marked by Northern or Southern

    astray in determining the locality of their composition.]

GRAMMATICAL DETAILS.

I. +Nouns.+

(1) _Number._--The plurals generally end in _-es_ (_e»ù_), _-s_. _Y»ùen_
(eyes), _trumpen_ (trumpets), are the only plurals in _-en_ that occur
in the poems. In Robson‚Äôs Metrical Romances we find _fellun_ (fells,
hills,), _dellun_ (dells), and _eyren_ (eggs), in Liber Cure Cocorum.
The plurals of _brother_, _child_, _cow_, _do»ùter_ (daughter), are
_brether_, _childer_, _kuy_, and _de»ùter_.

(2) _Gender._--The names of inanimate things are in the neuter gender,
as in modern English. The exceptions are _deep_ (fem.), _gladnes_
(fem.), and _wind_ (masc.).

(3) _Case._--The genitive singular (masc. and fem.) ends in _-es_
(_-e»ù_), _-s_, but occasionally the inflexion is dropped; as, ‚ÄúBalta»ùar
thewes,‚Äù the virtues of Balshazzar.[52] If ‚Äú_honde_ my»ùt,‚Äù ‚Äú_honde_
werk,‚Äù ‚Äú_hellen_ wombe,‚Äù are not compounds, we have instances of the
final _-e_ (_en_) which formed the genitive case of _feminine_ nouns in
the Southern English of the fourteenth century.

In the phrases ‚Äú_besten_ blod‚Äù (blood of beasts), ‚Äú_blonkken_ bak‚Äù (back
of horses), ‚Äú_chyldryn_ fader‚Äù (father of children), ‚Äú_nakeryn_ noyse‚Äù
(noise of nakers), we have a trace of the genitive plural _-ene_ (A.S.
_-ena_).

    [Footnote 52: In the romance of ‚ÄúSyr Gawayn and the Grene Kny»ùt‚Äù
    we find ‚Äú_blonk_ (horse) sadele,‚Äù ‚Äú_fox_ felle‚Äù (skin). In _blonk_
    an _e_ has probably been dropped.]


II. +Adjectives.+

(1) _Number._--The final _e_, as a sign of the plural, is very
frequently dropped. _Pover_ (poor), _sturn_ (strong), make the plurals
_poveren_ and _sturnen_. In the phrase, ‚Äú√æo sy»ùte»ù so _quyke»ù_‚Äù[53]
(those sights so living), the _-e»ù_ (= _-es_) is a mark of the plural,
very common in Southern writers of the fourteenth century, and employed
as a plural inflexion of the adjective until a very late period in our
literature.

The Article exhibits the following forms:

  SINGULAR.        PLURAL.
  Masc.  Fem.
  The.   tho.[54]  tho.

_This_ forms the plural _thise_ and _thes_ (_these_). _That_ is always
used as a demonstrative, and never as the neuter of the article; its
plural is _thos_ (those).[55] The older form, _theos_ = _these_, shows
that the _e_ is not a sign of the plural, as many English grammarians
have asserted.

(2) _Degrees of Comparison._--The comparative degree ends in _-er_, and
the superlative in _-est_.

Adjectives and adverbs terminating in the syllable _-lyche_ form the
comparative in _-loker_ and the superlative in _-lokest_; as, positive
_uglyche_ (= ugly), comp. _ugloker_, superl. _uglokest_. The long vowel
of the positive is often shortened in the comp. and superl., as in the
modern English _late_, _latter_, _last_.

  Positive.          Comparative.    Superlative.
  Brade (broad),     bradder,        braddest.
  Dere (dear),       derrer,         derrest.
  Lyke (like),       lykker,         lykkest.
  Swete (sweet),     swetter,        swettest.
  Wayke (weak),      wakker,         wakkest.
  Wode (mad),        wodder,         woddest.

The following irregular forms are occasionally met with:

  Positive.          Comparative.    Superlative.
  Fer (far),         ferre (fyrre),  ferrest.
  He»ùe (high),       herre,          he»ùest (hest).
  Ne»ùe (nigh, near)  nerre,          nerrest (nest).
  Sare (sore),       sarre,          sarrest.
  Forme (first),                     formast.
  Mikelle (great),   mo              most.
  Yvel, ill (bad),   wers (worre),   werst.

_Numerals._--_Twinne_ and _thrinne_ occur for two and three. The ordinal
numbers are--

  first (fyrste), the forme,
  secunde, that other, tother,
  thryd,   }
  thrydde, }
  fur√æe,
  fyf√æe,
  sexte,
  seven√æe,
  a»ùt√æe,
  nente,
  ten√æe, }
  ty√æe.  }

The Northumbrian numerals corresponding to _seven√æe_, _a»ùt√æe_, _nente_,
_ten√æe_, are _sevend_, _aghtend_, _neghend_, _tend_. The Southern forms
end in _-the_, as _seven√æe_, _ei»ùteo√æe_, _ny√æe_, _teo√æe_ (_ty√æe_).

    [Footnote 53: The feminine form is seldom employed.]

    [Footnote 54: The Northumbrian plural article is _tha_.]

    [Footnote 55: The Northumbrian corresponding form is _thas_.]


III. +Pronouns.+

In the following poems we find the pronoun _ho_, she, still keeping its
ground against the Northumbrian _scho_.[56] _Ho_ is identical with the
modern Lancashire _hoo_ (or _huh_ as it is sometimes written), which in
some parts of England has nearly the same pronunciation as the
accusative _her_.

The Northumbrian _thay_ (they) has displaced the older Midland _he_,
corresponding to the Southern pronoun _hii_, _hi_ (A.S. _h√≠_). _Hores_
and _thayre»ù_ (theirs) occasionally occur for _here_.[57] The genitives
in _-es_, due no doubt to Scandinavian influence, are very common in
Northumbrian writers of the fourteenth century, but are never found in
any Southern work of the same period.

_Hit_ is frequently employed as an indefinite pronoun of all genders,
and is plural as well as singular. It is, as has been previously shown,
uninflected in the genitive or possessive case.

_Me_ in Southern writers is used as an indefinite pronoun of the _third_
person, and represents our _one_, but in the present poems it is of all
persons, and seems to be placed in apposition with the subject of the
sentence corresponding to our use of myself, thyself, himself, etc.; as,

  ‚Äú_He_ swenges _me_ √æys,‚Äù etc. = He himself sends this, etc.[58]
  ‚ÄúNow swe»ùe _me_ √æider swyftly‚Äù = Now go (thou) thyself thither
      swiftly.[59]
  ‚Äú_He_ mete»ù _me_ √æis good man‚Äù = He himself meets this good man.[60]

Sturzen-Becker (‚ÄúSome Notes on the leading Grammatical Characteristics
of the Principal Early English Dialects, Copenhagen, 1868‚Äù) thinks that
I have been led astray with regard to this use of _me_, which he says is
nothing more than the _dativus ethicus_.

The _me_ in these examples may be merely an expletive, having arisen out
of the general use of the dative ethicus, but the context does not
satisfy me that it has the force of a dative. Dr. Guest (Proceedings of
Philolog. Soc., vol. i. p.¬†151-153, 1842-1844) has discussed this
construction at some length, and he carefully distinguishes the dative
of the 1st person from the indeterminate (or indefinite) pronoun _me_ =
Fr. one. He says that in Old Frisian the indefinite pronoun has two
forms, _min_ and _me_, ‚Äúthe latter of which seems to be always used as a
suffix to the verb, as _momme_, one may; _somme_, one should,‚Äù etc. The
same construction was occasionally used in our own language, and it no
doubt gave rise to those curious idioms which are noticed by Pegge in
his ‚ÄúAnecdotes of the Eng. Lang.,‚Äù p.¬†217. This writer, whose evidence
to a _fact_ we may avail ourselves of, whatever we think of his
criticism or his scholarship, quotes the following as forms of speech
then prevalent among the Londoners: ‚Äúand so says _me_ I;‚Äù ‚Äúwell what
does _me_ I;‚Äù ‚Äúso says _me_ she;‚Äù ‚Äúthen away goes _me_ he;‚Äù ‚Äúwhat does
_me_ they?‚Äù Here it is obvious that _me_ is the indeterminate pronoun,
and represents the _subject_, while the personal pronoun is put in
apposition to it, so that ‚Äúsays _me_ I‚Äù is equivalent to ‚Äú_one says,
that is I_,‚Äù[61]. These idioms are not unknown to our literature.

  (1) ‚ÄòBut as he was by diverse principall young gentlemen, to his no
  small glorie, lifted up on horseback, _comes me a page_ of
  Amphialus, etc.‚Äô Pembr. Arcad. B. iii.

Other idioms, which have generally been confounded with those last
mentioned, have the indeterminate pronoun preceded by a nominative
absolute.

  (2) ‚Äò_I_, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was
  Crab, and--_goes me_ to the fellow, who whips the dogs,‚Äô etc. Two
  Gent. of Verona, 4. 4.

  (3) ‚Äò_He thrusts me_ himself into the company of three or four
  gentlemanlike dogs under the Duke‚Äôs Table.‚Äô _Ib._ See B.¬†Jons. Ev.
  Man in his Humour, 3, 1.

Johnson considers the _me_ in examples 2 and 3 to be the oblique case of
the first pers. pron., and treats it as ‚Äúa ludicrous expletive.‚Äù It is
difficult to say how he would have parsed example 2 on such a
hypothesis.

With these instances of the use of _me_ (indef. or reflexive), the
reader may compare the following:

  (1) ‚ÄúSuche a touche in that tyde, _he_ ta»ùte (Gauan) hym in tene
      And _gurdes me_, Sir Gallerun, evyn grovelonges on grounde.‚Äù
        (The Anturs of Arther at the Tarnewathelan, p.¬†22.)

  (2) There at the dore he (the Fox) cast _me_ downe hys pack.
        Spenser‚Äôs Shep. Cal. ed. Morris, p. 460, l.¬†243.

Cp. _Cut me_, i. Hen. IV. Act 4. Sc. 4; _steps me_, Ib. Act 4, Sc. 3;
_comes me, runs me_, Ib. Act 3, Sc. 1.

  (3) ‚ÄúJuno enraged, and fretting thus,
      _Runs me_ unto one √Üolus.‚Äù --(Virgile Travestie, 1664.)

The indefinite _me_ = one is not uncommon in Elizabethan writers. Cf.
‚Äú_touch me_ his hat;‚Äù ‚Äú_touch me_ hir with a pint of sack,‚Äù etc.; ‚Äúand
_stop me_ his dice you are a villaine‚Äù (Lodge‚Äôs Wit‚Äôs Miserie).

The following table exhibits the declension of the personal and relative
pronouns:--

  Gen. Oure,         yor, youre,  her (here), hor,  hit.
  Dat. Vus (= uus),  yow, you,    hem, hom,         hit.
  Acc. Vus (= uus),  yow, you,    hem, hom,         hit.

  Nom. Who (quo).

IV. +Verbs.+

_Infinitive Mood._--The _-en_ of the infinitive is frequently dropped,
without even a final _-e_ to mark its omission. Infinitives in _-y_, as
_louy_ (love), _schony_ (shun), _spotty_ (spot, defile), _styry_ (stir),
_wony_ (dwell), occasionally occur, and probably owe their appearance to
the author‚Äôs acquaintance with Southern literature.[62]

_Indicative Mood._--The final _e_ often disappears in the first and
third persons of the preterite tense, as I _loved_, he _loved_, instead
of I _lovede_, he _lovede_.

The _-en_ in the plural of the present and preterite tenses is
frequently dropped. The pl. present in _-e»ù_ occasionally occurs.

_Imperative Mood._--The imperative plural ends in _-es_ (_e»ù_), and not
in _-eth_ as in the Southern and ordinary Midland dialects.

_Participles._--The active or imperfect participle ends in _-ande_[63]
and never in _-ing_.

The participle passive or perfect of regular verbs terminates in _-ed_;
of irregular verbs in _-en_. Occasionally we find the _n_ disappearing,
as _bigonn-e_, _fund-e_, _runn-e_, _wonn-e_, where perhaps it is
represented by the final _-e_.

The prefix _-i_ or _-y_ (A.S. _-ge_) occurs twice only in the poems, in
_i-chose_ (chosen), and _i-brad_ (extended); but, while common enough in
the Southern and Midland dialects, it seems to be wholly unknown to the
Northumbrian speech.

The verb in the West-Midland dialect is conjugated according to the
following model:--

  I.--+Conjugation of Regular Verbs.+

  INDICATIVE MOOD.

    PRESENT TENSE.
  Singular.                 Plural.
  (I) hope,                 (We) hopen.
  (Thou) hopes,             (»úe) hopen.
  (He) hopes,               (Thay) hopen.

    PRETERITE TENSE.
  (I) hopede[64] (hoped),   (We) hopeden.
  (Thou) hopedes (hoped),   (»úe) hopeden.
  (He) hopede[64] (hoped),  (Thay) hopeden.

  Singular.
  (I) kerve,      renne,   smite,   stonde.
  (Thou) kerves,  rennes,  smites,  stondes.
  (He) kerves,    rennes,  smites,  stondes.

  Plural.
  (We) kerven,    rennen,  smiten,  stonden.
  (»úe)    ‚Äû         ‚Äû         ‚Äû        ‚Äû
  (Thay)  ‚Äû         ‚Äû         ‚Äû        ‚Äû

    PRETERITE TENSE.

  Singular.
  (I) carf,       ran,     smot,    stod.
  (Thou) carve,   ranne,   smote,   stode.
  (He) carf,      ran,     smot,    stod.

Very frequently the _e_ in the second person is dropped,[65] as in the
Northumbrian dialect, but we never meet with such forms as carves
(=¬†carvedest), rannes (=¬†ranst), smotes (=¬†smotest), etc.

  Plural.
  (We) corven,    runnen,  smiten,  stonden.
  (»úe)    ‚Äû          ‚Äû       ‚Äû         ‚Äû
  (Thay)  ‚Äû          ‚Äû       ‚Äû         ‚Äû

  PASSIVE PARTICIPLES.

  Corven,         runnen,  smiten,  stonden.

The Northumbrian dialect does not preserve any separate form for the
preterite plural, and this distinction is not always observed in the
present poems.

    May,        ‚Äû    mi»ùte.

    Wote,       ‚Äû    wiste.
    Wille,      ‚Äû    wolde.

_Schal_ (shall) in the second person singular is _schal_ or _schalt_;
so, too, we occasionally find _wyl_ for _wylt_.

The present plural of _schal_ is _schul_, _schulen_, or _schyn_.

The verb _to be_ is thus conjugated:--

  INDICATIVE MOOD.

  PRESENT TENSE.        PAST TENSE.

  Singular.
  (I) am.               (I) was, wat»ù.
  (Thou) art.           (Thou) was, wat»ù.
  (He) is, bes, bet»ù.   (He) was, wat»ù.

  Plural.
  (We) arn, are, ar.    (We) wern, were.
  (»úe) arn, are, ar.    (»úe) wern, were.
  (Thay) arn, are, ar.  (Thay) wern, were.

The verbs _be_, _have_, _wille_, have negative forms; as, _nam_ = am
not; _nar_ = are not; _nas_ = was not; _naf_ = have not; _nade_ = had
not; _nyl_ = will not.

The following contractions are occasionally met with: _bos_ = behoves;
_byhod_ = behoved; _ha_ = have; _ma_ = make; _man_ = make (pl.) _mat»ù_
(_mas_) = makes; _ta_ = take; _tat»ù_ (= _tas_) = takes; _tane_, _tone_ =
taken.

    [Footnote 62: _Schonied_ occurs for _schoned_. No Southern writer
    would retain, I think, the _i_ in the preterite.]

    [Footnote 63: Garnett asserts that the present participle in
    _-ande_ is ‚Äúa _certain criterion_ of a Northern dialect subsequent
    to the thirteenth century.‚Äù It is never found in any Southern
    writer, but is common to many Midland dialects. Capgrave employs
    it frequently in his Chronicles. It is, however, no safe criterion
    by itself.]

    [Footnote 64: The final _e_ is often dropped.]

    [Footnote 65: In _The Wohunge of Ure Lauerd_ the _e_ is constantly
    omitted.]


V. +Adverbs.+

The Norse forms _hethen_, _quethen_ (_whethen_),[66] and _thethen_, seem
to have been known to the West-Midland dialect as well as the Saxon
forms _hence_ (_hennes_, _henne_), _whence_ (_whennes_), _thence_
(_thennes_), etc. The adverbs _in-blande_ (together), _in-lyche_
(alike), _in-mydde_ (amidst), _in-monge_ (amongst), are due, perhaps, to
Scandinavian influence.

    [Footnote 66: ‚ÄúSyr Gawayn and the Grene Kny»ùt.‚Äù]


VI. +Prepositions.+

The preposition _from_ never occurs in the following poems; it is
replaced by _fro_, _fra_ (Northumbrian), O.N. _fr√°_.


VII. +Conjunctions.+

The conjunction _if_ takes a negative form; as, _nif_ = if not, unless.




DESCRIPTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT USED IN THE PRESENT VOLUME.[67]


+Cotton MS. Nero A. x.+ A small quarto volume, consisting of three
different MSS. bound together, which originally had no connection with
each other. Prefixed is an imperfect list of contents in the
hand-writing of James, the Bodley Librarian.

The first portion consists of a panegyrical oration in Latin by Justus
de Justis, on John Chedworth, archdeacon of Lincoln, dated at Verona
16th July, 1468. It occupies thirty-six folios, written on vellum, and
is the original copy presented by the author.

The second portion is that we are more immediately concerned with. It is
described by James as ‚Äú_Vetus poema Anglicanum, in quo sub insomnii
figmento multa ad religionem et mores spectantia explicantur_,‚Äù and this
account, with some slight changes, is adopted by Smith and Planta, in
their catalogues; both of whom assign it to the fifteenth century. It
will appear, by what follows, that no less than four distinct poems have
been confounded together by these writers.

This portion of the volume extends from fol. 37 to fol. 126, inclusive,
and is written by one and the same hand, in a small, sharp, irregular
character, which is often, from the paleness of the ink, and the
contractions used, difficult to read. There are no titles or rubrics,
but the divisions are marked by large initial letters of blue,
flourished with red, and several illuminations, coarsely executed, serve
by way of illustration, each of which occupies a page.

  1. Four of these are prefixed to the first poem. In the first the
  Author is represented slumbering in a meadow, by the side of a
  streamlet, clad in a long red gown, having falling sleeves, turned
  up with white, and a blue hood attached round the neck.

  In the second the same person appears, drawn on a larger scale, and
  standing by the stream. In the third he occurs nearly in the same
  position, with his hands raised, and on the opposite side a lady
  dressed in white, in the costume of Richard the Second‚Äôs and Henry
  the Fourth‚Äôs time, buttoned tight up to the neck, with long hanging
  sleeves. Her hair is plaited on each side, and on her head is a
  crown. In the fourth we see the author kneeling by the water, and
  beyond the stream is depicted a castle or palace, on the embattled
  wall of which appears the same lady, with her arm extended towards
  him.

The poem commences on fol. 39, and consists of one hundred and one
twelve-line stanzas,[68] every five of which conclude with the same
line, and are connected by the iteration of a leading expression. It
concludes on fol. 55b.

  2. Then follow two more illuminations; in the first of which Noah
  and his family are represented in the ark; in the second the prophet
  Daniel expounding the writing on the wall to the affrighted
  Belshazzar and his queen. These serve as illustrations to the second
  poem, which begins at fol. 57, and is written in long alliterative
  lines. It concludes on fol. 82.

  3. Two illuminations precede, as before; one of which represents the
  sailors throwing the prophet Jonas into the sea, the other depicts
  the prophet in the attitude of preaching to the people of Nineveh.
  The poem is in the same metre as the last, and commences at fol. 83.

It is occupied wholly with the story of Jonas, as applicable to the
praise of meekness and patience; and ends on fol. 90.

  4. The Romance intitled _Sir Gawayne and the Grene Kny»ùt_ follows,
  fol. 91. Prefixed is an illumination of a headless knight on
  horseback, carrying his head by its hair in his right hand, and
  looking benignly at an odd-eyed bill-man before him; while from a
  raised structure above, a king armed with a knife, his queen, an
  attendant with a sabre, and another bill-man scowling looks on. Here
  and elsewhere the only colours used are green, red, blue, and
  yellow. It ends on fol. 124b., and at the conclusion, in a later
  hand, is written ‚ÄúHony soit qÃÉ mal penc,‚Äù which may, perhaps, allude
  to the illumination on the opposite page, fol. 125, representing the
  stolen interview between the wife of the Grene Kny»ùt and Sir
  Gawayne. Above the lady‚Äôs head is written:

    Mi mind is mukel on on, √æ{a}t wil me no»ùt amende,
    Sum time was trewe as ston, & fro schame cou√æ{e} hir defende.

It does not appear very clearly how these lines apply to the painting.
Two additional illuminations follow; in the first of which Gawayne is
seen approaching the _Grene Chapel_, whilst his enemy appears above,
wielding his huge axe; and in the second Sir Gawayne, fully equipped in
armour, is represented in the presence of king Arthur and queen
Guenever, after his return to the court.

The third and concluding portion of the Cotton volume extends from fol.
127 to fol. 140b, inclusive, and consists of theological excerpts, in
Latin, written in a hand of the end of the thirteenth century. At the
conclusion is added _Epitaphium de Ranulfo, abbate Ramesiensi_, who was
abbot from the year 1231 to 1253, and who is erroneously called _Ralph_
in the _Monasticon_, vol. ii. p. 548, new ed.

    [Footnote 67: Taken with some few alterations from Sir F. Madden‚Äôs
    ‚ÄúSyr Gawayn.‚Äù]

    [Footnote 68: A line, however, is missing from the MS. on fol.
    55b. See page 15.]

The Pearl: Sidenotes

I.
Description of a lost pearl (_i.e._ a beloved child).
The father laments the loss of his pearl.
He often visits the spot where his pearl disappeared, and hears a
sweet song.
Where the pearl was buried there he found lovely flowers.
Each blade of grass springs from a dead grain.
In the high season of August the parent visits the grave of his lost
child.
Beautiful flowers covered the grave.
From them came a delicious odour.
The bereaved father wrings his hands for sorrow, falls asleep upon the
flowery plot, and dreams.

II.
In spirit he is carried to an unknown region, where the rocks and cliffs
gleamed gloriously.
The hill sides were decked with crystal cliffs.
The leaves of the trees were like burnished silver.
The gravel consisted of precious pearls.
The father forgets his sorrow.
He sees birds of the most beautiful hues, and hears their sweet melody.
No tongue could describe the beauty of the forest.
All shone like gold.
The dreamer arrives at the bank of a river, which gave forth sweet
sounds.
In it, stones glittered like stars in the welkin on a winter night.

III.
His grief abates, and he follows the course of the stream.
No one could describe his great joy.
He thought that Paradise was on the opposite bank.
The stream was not fordable.
More and more he desires to see what is beyond the brook.
But the way seemed difficult.
The dreamer finds new marvels.
He sees a crystal cliff, at the foot of which, sits a maiden clothed in
glistening white.
He knows that he has seen her before.
He desires to call her but is afraid, at finding her in such a strange
place.

IV.
So he stands still, like a well trained hawk.
He fears lest she should escape before he could speak to her.
His long lost one is dressed in royal array--decked with precious
pearls.
She comes along the stream towards him.
Her kirtle is composed of ‚Äòsute,‚Äô ornamented with pearls.
She wore a crown of pearls.
Her hair hung down about her.
Her colour was whiter than whalebone.
Her hair shone as gold.
The trimming of her robe consisted of precious pearls.
A wonderful pearl was set in her breast.
No man from here to Greece, was so glad as the father, when he saw his
pearl on the bank of the stream.
The maiden salutes him.

V.
The father enquires of the maiden whether she is his long-lost pearl,
and longs to know who has deprived him of his treasure.
The maiden tells him that his pearl is not really lost.
She is in a garden of delight, where sin and mourning are unknown.
The rose that he had lost is become a pearl of price.
The pearl blames his rash speech.
The father begs the maiden to excuse his speech, for he really thought
his pearl was wholly lost to him.
The maiden tells her father that he has spoken three words without
knowing the meaning of one.
The first word. The second. The third.

VI.
He is little to be praised who loves what he sees.
To love nothing but what one sees is great presumption.
To live in this kingdom (_i.e._ heaven) leave must be asked.
This stream must be passed over by death.
The father asks his pearl whether she is about to doom him to sorrow
again.
If he loses his pearl he does not care what happens to him.
The maiden tells her father to suffer patiently.
Though he may dance as any doe, yet he must abide God‚Äôs doom.
He must cease to strive.
All lies in God‚Äôs power to make men joyful or sad.

VII.
The father beseeches the pearl to have pity upon him.
He says that she has been both his bale and bliss.
And when he lost her, he knew not what had become of her.
And now that he sees her in bliss, she takes little heed of his sorrow.
He desires to know what life she leads.
The maiden tells him that he may walk and abide with her, now that he is
humble.
All are meek that dwell in the abode of bliss.
All lead a blissful life.
She reminds her father that she was very young when she died.
Now she is crowned a queen in heaven.

VIII.
The father of the maiden does not fully understand her.
Mary, he says, is the queen of heaven.
No one is able to remove the crown from her.
The maiden addresses the Virgin.
She then explains to her father that each has his place in heaven.
The court of God has a property in its own being.
Each one in it is a king or queen.
The mother of Christ holds the chief place.
We are all members of Christ‚Äôs body.
Look that each limb be perfect.
The father replies that he cannot understand how his pearl can be a
queen.
He desires to know what greater honour she can have.

IX.
She was only two years old when she died, and could do nothing to
please God.
She might be a countess or some great lady but not a queen.
The maiden informs her father that there is no limit to God‚Äôs power.
The parable of the labourers in the vineyard.
The lord of the vineyard hires workmen for a penny a day.
At noon the lord hires other men standing idle in the market place.
He commands them to go into his vineyard, and he will give them what is
right.
At an hour before the sun went down the lord sees other men
standing idle.
Tells them to go into the vineyard.

X.
As soon as the sun was gone down the ‚Äúreeve‚Äù was told to pay the
workmen.
To give each a penny.
The first began to complain.
Having borne the heat of the day he thinks that he deserves more.
The lord tells him that he agreed only to give him a penny.
The last shall be first, and the first last.
The maiden applies the parable to herself.
She came to the vine in eventide, and yet received more than others who
had lived longer.
The father says that his daughter‚Äôs tale is unreasonable.

XI.
In heaven, the maiden says, each man is paid alike.
God is no niggard.
The grace of God is sufficient for all.
Those who live long on the earth often forfeit heaven by sinning.
Innocents are saved by baptism.
Why should not God allow their labour.
Our first father lost heaven by eating an apple.
And all are damned for the sin of Adam.
But there came one who paid the penalty of our sins.
The water that came from the pierced side of Christ was baptism.

XII.
Repentance must be sought by prayer with sorrow and affliction.
The guilty may be saved by contrition.
Two sorts of people are saved, the _righteous_ and the _innocent_.
The words of David.
The innocent is saved by right.
The words of Solomon.
David says no man living is justified.
Pray to be saved by innocence and not by right.
When Jesus was on earth, little children were brought unto him.
The disciples rebuked the parents.
Christ said, ‚ÄúSuffer little children to come unto me,‚Äù etc.

XIII.
No one can win heaven except he be meek as a child.
The pearl of price is like the kingdom of heaven, pure and clean.
Forsake the mad world and purchase the spotless pearl.
The father of the maiden desires to know who formed her figure and
wrought her garments.
Her beauty, he says, is not natural.
Her colour passes the fleur-de-lis.
The maiden explains to her father that she is a bride of Christ.
She is without spot or blemish.
Her weeds are washed in the blood of Christ.
The father asks the nature of the Lamb that has chosen his daughter, and
why she is selected as a bride.

XIV.
The Lamb has one hundred and forty thousand brides.
St. John saw them on the hill of Sion in a dream, in the new city of
Jerusalem.
Isaiah speaks of Christ or the Lamb.
He says that He was led as a lamb to the slaughter.
In Jerusalem was Christ slain.
With buffets was His face flayed.
He endured all patiently as a lamb.
For us He died in Jerusalem.
The declaration of St. John, ‚ÄúBehold the Lamb of God,‚Äù etc.
Who can reckon His generation, that died in Jerusalem?
In the New Jerusalem St. John saw the Lamb sitting upon the throne.

XV.
The Lamb is without blemish.
Every spotless soul is a worthy bride for the Lamb.
No strife or envy among the brides.
None can have less bliss than another.
Our death leads us to bliss.
What St. John saw upon the Mount of Sion.
About the Lamb he saw one hundred and forty thousand maidens.
He heard a voice from heaven, like many floods.
He heard the maiden sing a new song.
So did the four beasts and the elders ‚Äúso sad of cheer.‚Äù
This assembly was like the Lamb, spotless and pure.
The father replies to the maiden.
He says he is but dust and ashes.
He wishes to ask one question, whether the brides have their abode in
castle-walls or in manor.

XVI.
Jerusalem, he says, in Judea.
But the dwelling of the brides should be perfect.
For such ‚Äúa comely pack‚Äù a great castle would be required.
The city in Jud√¶a, answers the maiden, is where Christ suffered, and is
the Old Jerusalem.
The New Jerusalem is where the Lamb has assembled his brides.
Jerusalem means the city of God.
In the Old city our peace was made at one.
In the New city is eternal peace.

XVII.
The father prays his daughter to bring him to the blissful bower.
His daughter tells him that he shall see the outside, but not a foot may
he put in the city.

XVIII.
The maiden then tells her father to go along the bank till he comes to
a hill.
He reaches the hill, and beholds the heavenly city.
As St. John saw it, so he beheld it.
The city was of burnished gold.
Pitched upon gems, the foundation composed of twelve stones.
The names of the precious stones.
i. Jasper. ii. Sapphire. iii. Chalcedony. iv. Emerald.
v. Sardonyx. vi. Ruby. vii. Chrysolite. viii. Beryl.
ix. Topaz. x. Chrysoprasus. xi. Jacinth. xii. Amethyst.
The city was square.
The wall was of jasper.
Twelve thousand furlongs in length and breadth.

XIX.
Each ‚Äúpane‚Äù had three gates.
Each gate adorned with a pearl.
Such light gleamed in all the streets, that there was no need of the sun
or moon.
God was the light of those in the city.
The high throne might be seen, upon which the ‚Äúhigh God‚Äù sat.
A river ran out of the throne; it flowed through each street.
No church was seen.
God was the church; Christ the sacrifice.
The gates were ever open.
There is no night in the city.
The planets, and the sun itself, are dim compared to the divine light.
Trees there renew their fruit every month.
The beholder of this fair city stood still as a ‚Äúdased quail.‚Äù

XX.
As the moon began to rise he was aware of a procession of virgins
crowned with pearls, in white robes, with a pearl in their breast.
As they went along they shone as glass.
The Lamb went before them.
There was no pressing.
The ‚Äúalder men‚Äù fell groveling at the feet of the Lamb.
All sang in praise of the Lamb.
The Lamb wore white weeds.
A wide wound was seen near his breast.
Joy was in his looks.
The father perceives his little queen.

Men desire more than they have any right to expect.
The good Christian knows how to make peace with God.
God give us grace to be his servants!

God is angry with the unclean worshipper, and with false priests.
The pure worshipper receives great reward.
The impure will bring upon them the anger of God, Who is pure and holy.
It would be a marvel if God did not hate evil.
Christ showed us that himself.
St. Matthew records the discourse.
The clean of heart shall look on our Lord.
What earthly noble, when seated at table above dukes, would like to see
a lad badly attired approach the table with ‚Äúrent cockers,‚Äù his coat
torn and his toes out?
For any one of these he would be turned out with a ‚Äúbig buffet,‚Äù and be
forbidden to re-enter, and thus be ruined through his vile clothes.
The parable of the ‚ÄúMarriage of the King‚Äôs Son.‚Äù
The king‚Äôs invitation.
Those invited begin to make excuses.
One had bought an estate and must go to see it.
Another had purchased some oxen and wished to see them ‚Äúpull in the
plough.‚Äù
A third had married a wife and could not come.
The Lord was greatly displeased, and commanded his servants to invite
the wayfaring, both men and women, the better and the worse, that his
palace might be full.
The servants brought in bachelors and squires.
When they came to the court they were well entertained.
The servants tell their lord that they have done his behest, and there
is still room for more guests.
The Lord commands them to go out into the fields, and bring in the halt,
blind, and ‚Äúone-eyed.‚Äù
For those who denied shall not taste ‚Äúone sup‚Äù to save them from death.

For many faults may a man forfeit bliss.
For sloth and pride he is thrust into the devil‚Äôs throat.
He is ruined by covetousness, perjury, murder, theft, and strife.
For robbery and ribaldry, for preventing marriages, and supporting the
wicked, for treason, treachery, and tyranny, man may lose eternal bliss.

III.
The high Prince of all is displeased with those who work wickedly.
For the first fault the devil committed, he felt God‚Äôs vengeance.
He, the fairest of all angels, forsook his sovereign, and boasted that
his throne should be as high as God‚Äôs.
For these words he was cast down to hell.
The fiends fell from heaven, like the thick snow, for forty days.

strongest that ever were created.

to seethe a tender kid.

milk, and pottage.

X.
God‚Äôs messengers go to Sodom.
Lot is sitting alone at the ‚Äúdoor of his lodge.‚Äù
Staring into the street he sees two men.
Beardless chins they had, and hair like raw silk.

Lot runs to meet them.
Invites them to remain awhile in his house, and in the morning they may
take their way.

with it.
Lot‚Äôs wife disregards the injunction.
The guests are well entertained.
But before they go to rest the city is up in arms.
With ‚Äúkeen clubs‚Äù the folk clatter on the walls, and demand that Lot
should deliver up his guests.
The wind yet stinks with their filthy speech.
Lot is in great trouble.
He leaves his guests and addresses the Sodomites.
He offers to give up to them his two daughters.
The rebels raise a great noise, and ask who made him a justice to judge
their deeds, who was but a boy when he came to Sodom.
The young men bring Lot within doors, and smite those outside with
blindness.
In vain they try to find the door of Lot‚Äôs house.

XI.
Early in the morning the angels command Lot to depart from Sodom, with
his wife and two daughters, and to look straight before him, for Sodom

their face.

any sea.‚Äù
Her companions do not miss her till they reach Zoar.
By this time all were drowned.
The people of Zoar, for dread, rush into the sea and are destroyed.
Only Zoar with three therein (Lot and his daughters) are saved.
Lot‚Äôs wife is an image of salt for two faults:
1. She served salt before the Lord at supper.
2. She looked behind her.
Abraham is up full early on the morn.
He looks towards Sodom, now only a pit filled with pitch, from which
rise smoke, ashes and cinders, as from a furnace.
A sea now occupies the place of the four cities.
It is a stinking pool, and is called the Dead Sea.
Nothing may live in it.
Lead floats on its surface.
A feather sinks to the bottom of it.
Lands, watered by this sea, never bear grass or weed.
A man cannot be drowned in it.
The clay clinging to it is corrosive, as alum, alkaran, sulphur, etc.,
which fret the flesh and fester the bones.
On the shores of this lake grow trees bearing fair fruits, which, when
broken or bitten, taste like ashes.
All these are tokens of wickedness and vengeance.
God loves the pure in heart.
Strive to be clean.
Jean de Meun tells how a lady is to be loved.
By doing what pleases her best.
Love thy Lord!
Conform to Christ, who is polished as a pearl.
By how comely a contrivance did he enter the womb of the virgin!
In what purity did he part from her!
No abode was better than his.
The sorrow of childbirth was turned to joy.
Angels solaced the virgin with organs and pipes.
The child Christ was so clean that ox and ass worshipped him.
He hated wickedness, and would never touch ought that was vile.
Yet there came to him lazars and lepers, lame and blind.
Dry and dropsical folk.
He healed all with kind speech.
His handling was so good, that he needed no knife to cut or carve with.
The bread he broke more perfectly than could all the tools of Toulouse.
How can we approach his court except we be clean?
God is merciful.
Through penance we may shine as a pearl.
Why is the pearl so prized?
She becomes none the worse for wear.
If she should become dim, wash her in wine.
She then becomes clearer than before.
So may the sinner polish him by penance.
Beware of returning to sin.
For then God is more displeased than ever.
The reconciled soul God holds as His own.
Ill deeds rob Him of it.
God forbids us to defile any vessels used in His service.
In Belshazzar‚Äôs time, the defiling of God‚Äôs vessels brought wrath upon
the king.

XII.
Daniel in his prophecies tells of the destruction of the Jews.
For their unfaithfulness in following other gods, God allowed the
heathen to destroy them, in the reign of Zedekiah, who practised
idolatry.
Nebuchadnezzar becomes his foe.
He besieges Jerusalem, and surrounds the walls.
The city is stuffed full of men.
Brisk is the skirmish.
Seven times a day are the gates assailed.
For two years the fight goes on, yet the city is not taken.
The folk within are in want of food.
Meager they become.
For so shut up are they that escape seems impossible.
But on a quiet night they steal out, and rush through the host.
They are discovered by the enemy.
A loud alarm is given.
They are pursued and overtaken.
Their king is made prisoner.
His chief men are presented as prisoners to Nebuchadnezzar.
His sons are slain.
His own eyes are put out.
He is placed in a dungeon in Babylon.
All for his ‚Äúbad bearing‚Äù against the Lord, who might otherwise have
been his friend.
Nebuchadnezzar ceased not until he had destroyed Jerusalem.
Nebuzaradan was ‚Äúchief of the chivalry.‚Äù
The best men were taken out of the city.
Nevertheless Nebuzaradan spared not those left.
Brains of bairns were spilt.
Priests pressed to death.
Wives and wenches foully killed.
All that escaped the sword were taken to Babylon, and were made to drag
the cart or milk the kine.
Nebuzaradan burst open the temple, and slew those therein.
Priests, pulled by the poll, were slain along with deacons, clerks, and
maidens.
The enemy pillages the temple of its pillars of brass, and the golden
candlestick from off the altar.
Goblets, basins, golden dishes, all are taken by Nebuzaradan, and
hampered together.
Solomon had made them with much labour.
The temple he beats down, and returns to Babylon.
Presents the prisoners to the king, among whom were Daniel and his three
companions.
Nebuchadnezzar has great joy, because his enemies are slain.
Great was his wonder when he saw the sacred jewelry.
He praises the God of Israel.
Such vessels never before came to Chaldea.
They are thrust into the treasury.
Nebuchadnezzar reigns as emperor of all the earth, through the ‚Äúdoom of
Daniel,‚Äù who gave him good counsel.
Nebuchadnezzar dies and is buried.
Belshazzar succeeds him.
He holds himself the biggest in heaven or on earth.
He honours not God, but worships false phantoms.
He promises them rewards if good fortune befal.
If they vex him he knocks them in pieces.
He has a wife, and many concubines.
The mind of the king was fixed upon new meats and other vain things.

XIII.
Belshazzar, to exhibit his vainglory, proclaims throughout Babylon, that
all the great ones should assemble on a set day, at the Sultan‚Äôs feast.
Kings, dukes, and lords were commanded to attend the court.
To do the king honour many nobles came to Babylon.
It would take too long to name the number.
The city of Babylon is broad and big.
It is situated on a plain, surrounded by seven streams, a high wall, and
towers.
The palace was long and large, each side being seven miles in length.
High houses were within the walls.
The time of the feast has come.
Belshazzar sits upon his throne: the hall floor is covered with knights.
When all are seated, service begins.
Trumpets sound everywhere.
Bread is served upon silver dishes.
All sorts of musical instruments are heard in the hall.
The king, surrounded by his loves, drinks copiously of wine.
It gets into his head and stupifies him.
A cursed thought takes possession of him.
He commands his marshal to bring him the vessels taken from the temple
by Nebuchadnezzar, and to fill them with wine.
The marshal opens the chests.
Covers the cupboard with vessels.
The Jewels of Jerusalem deck the sides of the hall.
The altar and crown, blessed by bishop‚Äôs hands, and anointed with the
blood of beasts, are set before the bold Belshazzar.
Upon this altar were noble vessels curiously carved, basins of gold,
cups arrayed like castles with battlements, and towers with lofty
pinnacles.
Upon them were pourtrayed branches and leaves, the flowers of which were
white pearls, and the fruit flaming gems.
The goblets were ornamented with flowers of gold.
The candlestick was brought in, with its pillars of brass, and
ornamental boughs, upon which sat birds of various hues.
Lights shone bright from the candlestick, which once stood before the
‚ÄúHoly of Holies.‚Äù
The pollution of the sacred vessels is displeasing to God.
For ‚Äúa boaster on bench‚Äù drinks from them till he is as ‚Äúdrunken as the
devil.‚Äù
God is very angry.
Before harming the revellers He sends them a warning.
Belshazzar commands the sacred vessels to be filled with wine.
The cups and bowls are soon filled.
Music of all kind is heard in the hall.
Dukes, princes, concubines, and knights, all are merry.
Drinking of the sweet liquors they ask favours of their gods, who,
although dumb, are as highly praised ‚Äúas if heaven were theirs.‚Äù
A marvel befals the feasters.
The king first saw it.
Upon the plain wall, ‚Äúa palm with pointel in fingers‚Äù is seen writing.
The bold Belshazzar becomes frightened.
His knees knock together.
He roars for dread, still beholding the hand, as it wrote on the
rough wall.
The hand vanishes but the letters remain.
The king recovers his speech and sends for the ‚Äúbook-learned;‚Äù but none
of the scholars were wise enough to read it.
Belshazzar is nearly mad.
Commands the city to be searched throughout for the ‚Äúwise of
witchcraft.‚Äù
He who expounds the strange letters, shall be clothed in ‚Äúgowns of
purple.‚Äù
A collar of gold shall encircle his throat.
He shall be the third lord in the realm.
As soon as this cry was upcast, to the hall came clerks out of Chaldea,
witches and diviners, sorcerers and exorcists.
But after looking on the letters they were as ignorant as if they had
looked into the leather of the left boot.
The king curses them all and calls them churls.
He orders the harlots to be hanged.
The queen hears the king chide.
She inquires the cause.
Goes to the king, kneels before him, and asks why he has rent his robes
for grief, when there is one that has the Spirit of God, the counsellor
of Nebuchadnezzar, the interpreter of his dreams, through the holy
Spirit of God.
The name of this man is Daniel, who was brought a captive from Jud√¶a.
The queen tells the king to send for Daniel.
Her counsel is accepted.
Daniel comes before Belshazzar.
The king tells him that he has heard of his wisdom, and his power to
discover hidden things, and that he wants to know the meaning of the
writing on the wall.
Promises him, if he can explain the text of the letters and their
interpretation, to clothe him in purple and pall, and put a ring about
his neck, and to make him ‚Äúa baron upon bench.‚Äù
Daniel addresses the king, and reminds him how that God supported his
father, and gave him power to exalt or abase whomsoever he pleased.
Nebuchadnezzar was established on account of his faith in God.
So long as he remained true, no man was greater.
But at last pride touches his heart.
He forgets the power of God, and blasphemes His name.
He says that he is ‚Äúgod of the ground,‚Äù and the builder of Babylon.
Hardly had Nebuchadnezzar spoken, when God‚Äôs voice is heard, saying,
‚ÄúThy principality is departed.
Thou, removed from men, must abide on the moor, and walk with wild
beasts, eat herbs, and dwell with wolves and asses.‚Äù
For his pride he becomes an outcast.
He believes himself to be a bull or an ox.
Goes ‚Äúon all fours,‚Äù like a cow, for seven summers.
His thighs grew thick.
His hair became matted and thick, from the shoulders to the toes.
His beard touched the earth.
His brows were like briars.
His eyes were hollow, and grey as the kite‚Äôs.
Eagle-hued he was.
At last he recovered his ‚Äúwit,‚Äù and believed in God.
Then soon was he restored to his seat.
But thou, Belshazzar, hast disregarded these signs, and hast blasphemed
the Lord, defiled his vessels, filling them with wine for thy wenches,
and praising thy lifeless gods.
For this sin God has sent thee this strange sight, the fist with the
fingers writing on the wall.
These are the words: ‚ÄúMene, Tekel, Peres.
Mene.-- God has counted thy kingdom and finished it.
Tekel.-- Thy reign is weighed and is found wanting in deeds of faith.
Peres.-- Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Persians.
The Medes shall be masters here.‚Äù
The king commands Daniel to be clothed in a frock of fine cloth.
Soon is he arrayed in purple, with a chain about his neck.
A decree is made, that all should bow to him, as the third lord that
followed Belshazzar.
The decree was made known, and all were glad.
The day, however, past.
Night came on.
Before another day dawned, Daniel‚Äôs words were fulfilled.
The feast lasts till the sun falls.
The skies become dark.
Each noble hies home to his supper.
Belshazzar is carried to bed, but never rises from it, for his foes are
seeking to destroy his land, and are assembled suddenly.
The enemy is Darius, leader of the Medes.
He has legions of armed men.
Under cover of the darkness, they cross the river.
By means of ladders they get upon the walls, and within an hour enter
the city, without disturbing any of the watch.
They run into the palace, and raise a great cry.
Men are slain in their beds.
Belshazzar is beaten to death, and caught by the heels, is foully cast
into a ditch.
Darius is crowned king, and makes peace with the barons.
Thus the land was lost for the king‚Äôs sin.
He was cursed for his uncleanness, and deprived of his honour, as well
as of the joys of heaven.
Thus in three ways has it been shown, that uncleanness makes God angry.
Cleanness is His comfort.
The seemly shall see his face.
God give us grace to serve in His sight!

Patience: Sidenotes

I.
Patience is often displeasing, but it assuages heavy hearts, and
quenches malice.
Happiness follows sorrow.
It is better to suffer than to be angry.
Matthew tells us of the promises made by Christ: Blessed are the poor,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall ‚Äúwield the world.‚Äù
Blessed are the mourners, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the hungry, for they shall be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for mercy shall be their reward.
Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see the Saviour.
Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called God‚Äôs sons.
Blessed are they that live aright, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
These blessings are promised to those who follow poverty, pity, penance,
meekness, mercy, chastity, peace and patience.
Poverty and patience are to be treated together.
They are ‚Äúfettled in one form,‚Äù and have one meed.
Poverty will dwell where she lists, and man must needs suffer.
Poverty and patience are play-fellows.
What avails impatience, if God send affliction?
Patience is best.
Did not Jonah incur danger by his folly?

II.
Jonah was a prophet of the gentiles.
God‚Äôs word came to him, saying, ‚ÄúRise quickly, take the way to Nineveh.
Say that which I shall put in thine heart.
Wickedness dwells in that city.
Go swiftly and carry my message.‚Äù
Jonah is full of wrath.
He is afraid that the shrews will put him in the stocks, or put out
his eyes.
He thinks that God desires his death.
He determines not to go near the city, but fly to Tarshish.
Grumbling, he goes to port Joppa.
He says that God will not be able to protect him.
Jonah reaches the port, finds a ship ready to sail.
The seamen catch up the cross-sail, fasten the cables, weigh their
anchors, and spread sail.
A gentle wind wafts the ship along.
Was never a Jew so joyful as was Jonah then.
He has, however, put himself in peril, in fleeing from God.
The words of David.
Does He not hear, who made all ears?
He is not blind that formed each eye.
Jonah is now in no dread.
He is, however, soon overtaken.
The wielder of all things has devices at will.
He commands Eurus and Aquilo to blow.
The winds blow obedient to His word.
Out of the north-east the noise begins.
Storms arose, winds wrestled together, the waves rolled high, and never
rested.
Then was Jonah joyless.
The boat reeled around.
The gear became out of order.
Ropes and mast were broken.
A loud cry is raised, Many a lad labours to lighten the ship.
They throw overboard their bags and feather beds.
But still the wind rages, and the waves become wilder.
Each man calls upon his god.
Some called upon Vernagu, Diana, and Neptune, to the sun and to
the moon.
Then said one of the sailors: ‚ÄúSome lawless wretch, that has grieved his
God, is in the ship.
I advise that we lay lots upon each man.
When the guilty is gone the tempest may cease.‚Äù
This is agreed to.
All are assembled, from all corners of the ship, save Jonah the Jew, who
had fled into the bottom of the boat.
There he falls asleep.
Soon he is aroused, and brought on board.
Full roughly is he questioned.
The lot falls upon Jonah.
Then quickly they said: ‚ÄúWhat the devil hast thou done, doted wretch?
What seekest thou on the sea?
Hast thou no God to call upon?
Of what land art thou?
Thou art doomed for thy ill deeds.‚Äù
Jonah says: ‚ÄúI am a Hebrew, a worshipper of the world‚Äôs Creator.
All this mischief is caused by me, therefore cast me overboard.‚Äù
He proves to them that he was guilty.
The mariners are exceedingly frightened.
They try to make way with their oars, but their endeavours are useless.
Jonah must be doomed to death.
They pray to God, that they may not shed innocent blood.
Jonah is cast overboard.
The tempest ceases and the sea settles.
The stiff streams drive the ship about.
At last they reach a bank.
The seamen thank God, and perform solemn vows.
Jonah is in great dread.

III.
Jonah is shoved from the ship.
A wild whale swims by the boat.
He opens his swallow, and seizes the prophet.
It is not to be wondered at that Jonah suffered woe.
The prophet is without hope.
Cold was his comfort.
Jonah was only a mote in the whale‚Äôs jaws.
He entered in by the gills, and by means of one of the intestines of the
fish, came into a space as large as a hall.
The prophet fixes his feet firmly in the belly of the whale.
He searches into every nook of its navel.
The prophet calls upon God.
He cries for mercy.
He sits safely in a recess, in a bowel of the beast, for three days and
three nights.
The whale passes through many a rough region.
Jonah makes the whale feel sick.
The prophet prays to God in this wise:

IV.
‚ÄúLord! to thee have I cried out of hell‚Äôs womb.
Thou dippedst me in the sea.
Thy great floods passed over me.
The streams drive over me.
I am cast out from thy sight.
The abyss binds me.
The rushing waves play on my head.
Thou possessest my life.
In my anguish I remembered my God, and besought His pity.
When I am delivered from this danger, I will obey thy commands.‚Äù
God speaks fiercely to the whale, and he vomits out the prophet on a dry
space.
Jonah has need to wash his clothes.
God‚Äôs word comes to the prophet.
He is told to preach in Nineveh.
By night Jonah reaches the city.
Nineveh was a very great city.
Jonah delivers his message; ‚ÄúYet forty days and Nineveh shall come to
an end.
It shall be turned upside down, and swallowed quickly by the black
earth.‚Äù
This speech spreads throughout the city.
Great fear seizes all.
The people mourn secretly, clothe themselves in sackcloth, and cast
ashes upon their heads.
The message reaches the ears of the king.
He rends his robes, clothes himself in sackloth, and mourns in the dust.
He issues a decree, that all in the city, men, beasts, women and
children, prince, priest, and prelates, should fast for their sins.
Children are to be weaned from the breast.
The ox is to have no hay, nor the horse any water.
Who can tell if God will have mercy?
Though He is mighty, He is merciful, and may forgive us our guilt.
All believed and repented.
God forgave them through his goodness.

V.
Much sorrow settles upon Jonah.
He becomes very angry.
He prays to God and says: ‚ÄúWas not this my saying, when Thy message
reached me in my own country?
I knew Thy great goodness, Thy long-suffering, and Thy mercy.
I knew these men might make their peace with Thee, therefore I fled unto
Tarshish.
Take my life from me, O Lord!
It is better for me to die than live.‚Äù
God upbraids Jonah, saying: ‚ÄúIs this right to be so wroth?‚Äù
Jonah, jangling, uprises, and makes himself a bower, of hay and
ever-fern, to shield him from the sun.
He slept heavily all night.
God prepared a woodbine.
Jonah awakes, and is exceedingly glad of the bower.
The prophet, under its gracious leaves, is protected from the
sun‚Äôs rays.
Jonah wishes he had such a lodge in his own country.
God prepared a worm, that made the woodbine wither.
Jonah awakes and finds his woodbine destroyed.
The leaves were all faded.
The sun beat upon the head of Jonah.
He is exceedingly angry, and prays God that he may die.
God rebukes the prophet.
‚ÄúDost thou well,‚Äù He says, ‚Äúto be angry for the gourd?‚Äù
Jonah replies, ‚ÄúI would I were dead.‚Äù
God asks if it is to be wondered at that He should help His handy work.
Is not Jonah angry that his woodbine is destroyed, which cost him no
labour?
God is not to be blamed for taking pity upon people that He made.
Should He destroy Nineveh the sorrow of such a sweet place would sink to
His heart.
In the city there are little bairns who have done no wrong.
And there are others who cannot discern between their right hand and
their left hand.
There are also dumb beasts in the city incapable of sinning.
Judgment must be tempered with mercy.
He that is too hasty to rend his clothes must afterwards sit with worse
ones to sew them together.
Poverty and pain must be endured.
Patience is a noble point, though it displeases oft.
