The present work is a modest effort to reproduce approximately, in modern
measures, the venerable epic, Beowulf. _Approximately_, I repeat; for a
very close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be
prose to a modern ear.
The Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally
a deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient
reason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while,
however, he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted
from the criticisms of other students of the poem.
This work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike
the translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he
hopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of
English literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the
most ancient epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking;
and yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow
even a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of
Hrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the
hearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.
In order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been
used, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of
the original, permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading.
Perhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf
should be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe
to be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold
to say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is
justly called our first _epic_? Of those translators who have used verse,
several have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it
proper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and
Hrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or,
again, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be
interpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear
what has been beautifully called "the clanging tread of a warrior in
mail"?
Of all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone
gives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great
Teutonic epic.
The measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a
reproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences
closely resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking
poems. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as
much thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular
cadence. Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought
that modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has
been used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some
warrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For end-rhyme, see 1_53, 1_54; for
internal rhyme, 2_21, 6_40.)
What Gummere[1] calls the "rime-giver" has been studiously kept; _viz._,
the first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the
alliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only
sporadically. Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the
original. (See 7_61, 8_5.)
No two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally
after a caesural pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1.) Or, scientifically speaking,
Sievers's C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of
translation. Several of his types, however, constantly occur; _e.g._ A and
a variant (/ x | / x) (/ x x | / x); B and a variant (x / | x / ) (x x / |
x / ); a variant of D (/ x | / x x); E (/ x x | / ). Anacrusis gives
further variety to the types used in the translation.
The parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (_E.g._,
sustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.
The effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the
translation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have
been avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are
none, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.
With these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of
the story of the poem.
_Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or
palace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents.
The joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the
monster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of
joyance that reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and
anon he goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after
thane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong
enough and bold enough to cope with the monster. For twelve years he
persecutes Hrothgar and his vassals._
_Over sea, a day's voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,
king of the Geats, hears of Grendel's doings and of Hrothgar's misery. He
resolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With
fourteen chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that
country, he soon persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours
that elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When
Hrothgar's bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling
him that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his
palace. All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms._
_Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God's anger. He seizes
and kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.
A fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used,
both combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears
Grendel's shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den,
howling and yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal._
_The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall
Heorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and
his retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts._
_Grendel's mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She
is furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart
favorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is
called. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and
goes down to look for the female monster. After traveling through the
waters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her
den. There he sees Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal
struggle with the woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking
with him Grendel's head._
_Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Hrothgar
literally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among
the vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord._
_Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure._
_When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a
distinguished guest. He is the hero of the hour._
_Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he
has been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried
by a fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing
struggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is
inexpressible. They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor
the memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is
burnt. Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that
sailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national
hero of Geatland._
_The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness,
his goodness of heart, and his generosity._

It is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the
story of Beowulf shall be as familiar to English-speaking peoples as that
of the Iliad. Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history
of the life of the Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our
forefathers of pre-Alfredian eras, in their love of war, of sea, and of
adventure.

{The famous race of Spear-Danes.}
Lo! the Spear-Danes' glory through splendid achievements
The folk-kings' former fame we have heard of,
How princes displayed then their prowess-in-battle.
{Scyld, their mighty king, in honor of whom they are often called
Scyldings. He is the great-grandfather of Hrothgar, so prominent in the
poem.}
Oft Scyld the Scefing from scathers in numbers
Since first he found him friendless and wretched,
The earl had had terror: comfort he got for it,
Waxed 'neath the welkin, world-honor gained,
Till all his neighbors o'er sea were compelled to
An excellent atheling! After was borne him
{A son is born to him, who receives the name of Beowulf--a name afterwards
made so famous by the hero of the poem.}
A son and heir, young in his dwelling,
Whom God-Father sent to solace the people.
He had marked the misery malice had caused them,
Long been afflicted. The Lord, in requital,
Wielder of Glory, with world-honor blessed him.
Famed was Beowulf, far spread the glory
Of Scyld's great son in the lands of the Danemen.
{The ideal Teutonic king lavishes gifts on his vassals.}
The friends of his father, with fees in abundance
Must be able to earn that when age approacheth
Eager companions aid him requitingly,
When war assaults him serve him as liegemen:
'Mong all of the races. At the hour that was fated
{Scyld dies at the hour appointed by Fate.}
Scyld then departed to the All-Father's keeping
Warlike to wend him; away then they bare him
To the flood of the current, his fond-loving comrades,
Word-sway wielded, and the well-loved land-prince
Long did rule them.[3] The ring-stemmed vessel,
Bark of the atheling, lay there at anchor,
Icy in glimmer and eager for sailing;
{By his own request, his body is laid on a vessel and wafted seaward.}
Giver of rings, on the breast of the vessel,
The famed by the mainmast. A many of jewels,
Of fretted embossings, from far-lands brought over,
Was placed near at hand then; and heard I not ever
With weapons of warfare, weeds for the battle,
Bills and burnies; on his bosom sparkled
Many a jewel that with him must travel
On the flush of the flood afar on the current.
Excellent folk-gems, than others had given him
{He leaves Daneland on the breast of a bark.}
Who when first he was born outward did send him
Lone on the main, the merest of infants:
And a gold-fashioned standard they stretched under heaven
Seaward consigned him: sad was their spirit,
Their mood very mournful. Men are not able
{No one knows whither the boat drifted.}
Soothly to tell us, they in halls who reside,[4]
Heroes under heaven, to what haven he hied.

(_i.e._ God) _had perceived the malice-caused sorrow which they,
lordless, had formerly long endured_.
their distress, that they formerly had suffered life-sorrow a long
while_.
'geweald' from the context; and our translation is based upon this
assumption, though it is far from satisfactory. Kl. suggests
'laendagas' for 'lange': _And the beloved land-prince enjoyed (had) his
transitory days (i.e. lived)_. B. suggests a dislocation; but this is
a dangerous doctrine, pushed rather far by that eminent scholar.
but some eminent scholars read 'sele-raedenne' for 'sele-raedende.' If
that be adopted, the passage will read: _Men cannot tell us, indeed,
the order of Fate, etc._ 'Sele-raedende' has two things to support it:
(1) v. 1347; (2) it affords a parallel to 'men' in v. 50.
{Beowulf succeeds his father Scyld}
In the boroughs then Beowulf, bairn of the Scyldings,
Beloved land-prince, for long-lasting season
Was famed mid the folk (his father departed,
The prince from his dwelling), till afterward sprang
He graciously governed, grim-mooded, aged.
{Healfdene's birth.}
Four bairns of his body born in succession
Woke in the world, war-troopers' leader
Heorogar, Hrothgar, and Halga the good;
{He has three sons--one of them, Hrothgar--and a daughter named Elan.
Hrothgar becomes a mighty king.}
The well-beloved bedmate of the War-Scylfing leader.
Then glory in battle to Hrothgar was given,
Waxing of war-fame, that willingly kinsmen
Obeyed his bidding, till the boys grew to manhood,
To urge his folk to found a great building,
A mead-hall grander than men of the era
{He is eager to build a great hall in which he may feast his retainers}
Ever had heard of, and in it to share
With young and old all of the blessings
Then the work I find afar was assigned
To adorn the great folk-hall. In due time it happened
Early 'mong men, that 'twas finished entirely,
{The hall is completed, and is called Heort, or Heorot.}
Who wide-reaching word-sway wielded 'mong earlmen.
His promise he brake not, rings he lavished,
Treasure at banquet. Towered the hall up
High and horn-crested, huge between antlers:
Ere long then from hottest hatred must sword-wrath
Arise for a woman's husband and father.
Then the mighty war-spirit[1] endured for a season,
{The Monster Grendel is madly envious of the Danemen's joy.}
Bore it bitterly, he who bided in darkness,
Greeted him daily; there was dulcet harp-music,
Clear song of the singer. He said that was able
{[The course of the story is interrupted by a short reference to some old
account of the creation.]}
To tell from of old earthmen's beginnings,
That Father Almighty earth had created,
Set exultingly the sun's and the moon's beams
To lavish their lustre on land-folk and races,
And earth He embellished in all her regions
With limbs and leaves; life He bestowed too
{The glee of the warriors is overcast by a horrible dread.}
So blessed with abundance, brimming with joyance,
The warriors abided, till a certain one gan to
Dog them with deeds of direfullest malice,
A foe in the hall-building: this horrible stranger[2]
Who[3] dwelt in the moor-fens, the marsh and the fastness;
The wan-mooded being abode for a season
Had banned him and branded. For that bitter murder,
{Cain is referred to as a progenitor of Grendel, and of monsters in
general.}
The kindred of Cain crushed with His vengeance;
In the feud He rejoiced not, but far away drove him
From kindred and kind, that crime to atone for,

Came into being, and the giants that longtime
Grappled with God; He gave them requital.

the moor-fens, the marsh and the fastness, the land of the
giant-race._
{Grendel attacks the sleeping heroes}
When the sun was sunken, he set out to visit
The lofty hall-building, how the Ring-Danes had used it
For beds and benches when the banquet was over.
Then he found there reposing many a noble
Misery knew not. The monster of evil
Greedy and cruel tarried but little,
{He drags off thirty of them, and devours them}
Fell and frantic, and forced from their slumbers
Thirty of thanemen; thence he departed
With surfeit of slaughter sallying homeward.
In the dusk of the dawning, as the day was just breaking,
Was Grendel's prowess revealed to the warriors:
{A cry of agony goes up, when Grendel's horrible deed is fully realized.}
Then, his meal-taking finished, a moan was uplifted,
The long-worthy atheling, sat very woful,
Suffered great sorrow, sighed for his liegemen,
The spirit accursed: too crushing that sorrow,
{The monster returns the next night.}
But one night after continued his slaughter
Shameless and shocking, shrinking but little
From malice and murder; they mastered him fully.
He was easy to find then who otherwhere looked for
A bed in the bowers. Then was brought to his notice
Told him truly by token apparent
The hall-thane's hatred: he held himself after
Further and faster who the foeman did baffle.
Lone against all men, till empty uptowered
{King Hrothgar's agony and suspense last twelve years.}
The choicest of houses. Long was the season:
Twelve-winters' time torture suffered
The friend of the Scyldings, every affliction,
Certainly known to the children of men
Sadly in measures, that long against Hrothgar
Grendel struggled:--his grudges he cherished,
Murderous malice, many a winter,
The men of the Dane-folk, for money to settle,
No counsellor needed count for a moment
{Grendel is unremitting in his persecutions.}
The ill-planning death-shade, both elder and younger,
Trapping and tricking them. He trod every night then
The mist-covered moor-fens; men do not know where
Witches and wizards wander and ramble.
Grievous injuries, often accomplished,
Horrible hermit; Heort he frequented,
Gem-bedecked palace, when night-shades had fallen
{God is against the monster.}
(Since God did oppose him, not the throne could he touch,[5]
'Twas a fearful affliction to the friend of the Scyldings
{The king and his council deliberate in vain.}
Soul-crushing sorrow. Not seldom in private
Sat the king in his council; conference held they
What the braves should determine 'gainst terrors unlooked for.
{They invoke the aid of their gods.}
Gifts and offerings, earnestly prayed they
The devil from hell would help them to lighten
Their people's oppression. Such practice they used then,
Hope of the heathen; hell they remembered
{The true God they do not know.}
Judge of their actions, All-wielding Ruler,
No praise could they give the Guardian of Heaven,
The Wielder of Glory. Woe will be his who
Through furious hatred his spirit shall drive to
Wax no wiser; well for the man who,
Living his life-days, his Lord may face
And find defence in his Father's embrace!

passage.--'Sibbe' (154), which H.-So. regards as an instr., B. takes
as accus., obj. of 'wolde.' Putting a comma after Deniga, he renders:
_He did not desire peace with any of the Danes, nor did he wish to
remove their life-woe, nor to settle for money_.
others are given: (1) Though Grendel has frequented Heorot as a demon,
he could not become ruler of the Danes, on account of his hostility to
God. (2) Hrothgar was much grieved that Grendel had not appeared
before his throne to receive presents. (3) He was not permitted to
devastate the hall, on account of the Creator; _i.e._ God wished to
make his visit fatal to him.--Ne ... wisse (169) W. renders: _Nor had
he any desire to do so_; 'his' being obj. gen. = danach.
{Hrothgar sees no way of escape from the persecutions of Grendel.}
So Healfdene's kinsman constantly mused on
His long-lasting sorrow; the battle-thane clever
Was not anywise able evils to 'scape from:
Too crushing the sorrow that came to the people,
{Beowulf, the Geat, hero of the poem, hears of Hrothgar's sorrow, and
resolves to go to his assistance.}
Greatest of night-woes. So Higelac's liegeman,
Good amid Geatmen, of Grendel's achievements
Heard in his home:[1] of heroes then living
He was stoutest and strongest, sturdy and noble.
He said he the war-king would seek o'er the ocean,
The folk-leader noble, since he needed retainers.
For the perilous project prudent companions
Chided him little, though loving him dearly;
{With fourteen carefully chosen companions, he sets out for Dane-land.}
The excellent knight from the folk of the Geatmen
Had liegemen selected, likest to prove them
Trustworthy warriors; with fourteen companions
The vessel he looked for; a liegeman then showed them,
Fast the days fleeted; the float was a-water,
The craft by the cliff. Clomb to the prow then
Well-equipped warriors: the wave-currents twisted
The sea on the sand; soldiers then carried
Handsome war-armor; heroes outshoved then,
Warmen the wood-ship, on its wished-for adventure.
{The vessel sails like a bird}
The foamy-necked floater fanned by the breeze,
Likest a bird, glided the waters,
{In twenty four hours they reach the shores of Hrothgar's dominions}
The twist-stemmed vessel had traveled such distance
That the sailing-men saw the sloping embankments,
The sea cliffs gleaming, precipitous mountains,
Nesses enormous: they were nearing the limits
The men of the Weders clomb to the mainland,
Fastened their vessel (battle weeds rattled,
War burnies clattered), the Wielder they thanked
That the ways o'er the waters had waxen so gentle.
{They are hailed by the Danish coast guard}
Who the sea-cliffs should see to, saw o'er the gangway
Brave ones bearing beauteous targets,
Armor all ready, anxiously thought he,
Musing and wondering what men were approaching.
Turned him to coastward, mightily brandished
His lance in his hands, questioned with boldness.
{His challenge}
"Who are ye men here, mail-covered warriors
Clad in your corslets, come thus a-driving
Lest enemies ever anywise ravage
Danish dominions with army of war-ships.

Word-leave of warriors, I ween that ye surely

Nothing have known. Never a greater one
Of earls o'er the earth have _I_ had a sight of
No low-ranking fellow[4] adorned with his weapons,
But launching them little, unless looks are deceiving,
And striking appearance. Ere ye pass on your journey
As treacherous spies to the land of the Scyldings
What race ye belong to. Ye far-away dwellers,

Plainly to tell me what place ye are come from."

that adopted by S. and endorsed in the H.-So. notes, is: _B. heard

is: _B., being at home, heard this as occurring away from home_. The
H.-So. glossary and notes conflict.

conjectures. The reading adopted by H.-So. has been rendered in the
above translation. W., like H.-So., makes 'ic' the beginning of a new
sentence, but, for 'helmas baeron,' he reads 'hringed stefnan.' This
has the advantage of giving a parallel to 'brontne ceol' instead of a
kenning for 'go.'--B puts the (?) after 'holmas', and begins a new
sentence at the middle of the line. Translate: _What warriors are ye,
clad in armor, who have thus come bringing the foaming vessel over the
water way, hither over the seas? For some time on the wall I have been
coast guard, etc_. S. endorses most of what B. says, but leaves out
'on the wall' in the last sentence. If W.'s 'hringed stefnan' be
accepted, change line 51 above to, _A ring-stemmed vessel hither
o'ersea_.
_home-stayer_; (3) _common man_. Dr. H. Wood suggests _a man-at-arms

{Beowulf courteously replies.}
The chief of the strangers rendered him answer,
War-troopers' leader, and word-treasure opened:
{We are Geats.}
"We are sprung from the lineage of the people of Geatland,
And Higelac's hearth-friends. To heroes unnumbered
{My father Ecgtheow was well-known in his day.}
Ecgtheow titled; many a winter
He lived with the people, ere he passed on his journey,
Old from his dwelling; each of the counsellors
Widely mid world-folk well remembers him.
{Our intentions towards King Hrothgar are of the kindest.}
The son of King Healfdene, have come here to visit,
To the noble one bear we a weighty commission,
The helm of the Danemen; we shall hide, I ween,
{Is it true that a monster is slaying Danish heroes?}
As we soothly heard say, that some savage despoiler,
Some hidden pursuer, on nights that are murky
By deeds very direful 'mid the Danemen exhibits
Hatred unheard of, horrid destruction
{I can help your king to free himself from this horrible creature.}
I am able to render counsel to Hrothgar,
How he, wise and worthy, may worst the destroyer,
If the anguish of sorrow should ever be lessened,[1]
Comfort come to him, and care-waves grow cooler,
And troublous distress, while towereth upward
The handsomest of houses high on the summit."
{The coast-guard reminds Beowulf that it is easier to say than to do.}
Bestriding his stallion, the strand-watchman answered,
The doughty retainer: "The difference surely
Who judgeth wisely well shall determine.
This band, I hear, beareth no malice
{I am satisfied of your good intentions, and shall lead you to the
palace.}
To the prince of the Scyldings. Pass ye then onward
With weapons and armor. I shall lead you in person;
To keep from all injury your excellent vessel,

Close by the sea-shore, till the curved-necked bark shall

Onward they fared then (the vessel lay quiet,

Descended together, till they saw the great palace,

Of halls under heaven which the hero abode in;
Its lustre enlightened lands without number.
Then the battle-brave hero showed them the glittering

Turning his courser, quoth as he left them:

A by-path led the liegemen together.
The ring-sword radiant rang 'mid the armor
{They set their arms and armor against the wall.}
In warlike equipments. 'Gainst the wall of the building

But from greatness of soul ye sought for King Hrothgar."
{Beowulf replies.}
Then the strength-famous earlman answer rendered,
The proud-mooded Wederchief replied to his question,
{We are Higelac's table-companions, and bear an important commission to
your prince.}
Beowulf hight I. To the bairn of Healfdene,
The famous folk-leader, I freely will tell
To thy prince my commission, if pleasantly hearing
He'll grant we may greet him so gracious to all men."
His boldness of spirit was known unto many,
His prowess and prudence): "The prince of the Scyldings,
{Wulfgar, the thane, says that he will go and ask Hrothgar whether he will
see the strangers.}
The friend-lord of Danemen, I will ask of thy journey,
The giver of rings, as thou urgest me do it,
What answer the good one mindeth to render me."
He turned then hurriedly where Hrothgar was sitting,
The strength-famous went till he stood at the shoulder
The custom he minded. Wulfgar addressed then
His friendly liegelord: "Folk of the Geatmen
{He thereupon urges his liegelord to receive the visitors courteously.}

'ring-mail' and as parallel with 'gueth-byrne.' The passage would then
read: _The firm and hand-locked war-burnie shone, bright ring-mail,

{Hrothgar remembers Beowulf as a youth, and also remembers his father.}
Hrothgar answered, helm of the Scyldings:
"I remember this man as the merest of striplings.
His father long dead now was Ecgtheow titled,

Tell them expressly they're welcome in sooth to

Wulfgar went then, this word-message shouted:

Clad in corslets, cased in your helmets,
Wood-spears and war-shafts, await your conferring."

And as bid of the brave one the battle-gear guarded.

In far-off fatherland I fully did know of:

HROTHGAR AND BEOWULF.--_Continued_.
{Hrothgar responds.}
Hrothgar discoursed, helm of the Scyldings:
"To defend our folk and to furnish assistance,[1]
Thou soughtest us hither, good friend Beowulf.
{Reminiscences of Beowulf's father, Ecgtheow.}
The fiercest of feuds thy father engaged in,
'Mid Wilfingish warriors; then the Wederish people
For fear of a feud were forced to disown him.
Thence flying he fled to the folk of the South-Danes,
The hoard-seat of heroes held in my youth,
Rich in its jewels: dead was Heregar,
My kinsman and elder had earth-joys forsaken,
Healfdene his bairn. He was better than I am!
O'er the weltering waters to the Wilfings I sent
Ornaments old; oaths did he swear me.
{Hrothgar recounts to Beowulf the horrors of Grendel's persecutions.}
It pains me in spirit to any to tell it,
What grief in Heorot Grendel hath caused me,
Waned is my war-band, wasted my hall-troop;
Weird hath offcast them to the clutches of Grendel.
God can easily hinder the scather
From deeds so direful. Oft drunken with beer
{My thanes have made many boasts, but have not executed them.}
They would willingly wait on the wassailing-benches
A grapple with Grendel, with grimmest of edges.
Then this mead-hall at morning with murder was reeking,
The building was bloody at breaking of daylight,
The folk-hall was gory: I had fewer retainers,
Dear-beloved warriors, whom death had laid hold of.
{Sit down to the feast, and give us comfort.}
Sit at the feast now, thy intents unto heroes,[2]
Thy victor-fame show, as thy spirit doth urge thee!"
{A bench is made ready for Beowulf and his party.}
In the beer-hall blithesome a bench was made ready;
There warlike in spirit they went to be seated,
Proud and exultant. A liegeman did service,
{The gleeman sings}
{The heroes all rejoice together.}
Hearty in Heorot; there was heroes' rejoicing,
A numerous war-band of Weders and Danemen.
Grtvg. B. suggests for 457-458:
waere-ryhtum Þu, wine min Beowulf,
and for ar-stafum usic sohtest.
This means: _From the obligations of clientage, my friend Beowulf, and
for assistance thou hast sought us_.--This gives coherence to
Hrothgar's opening remarks in VIII., and also introduces a new motive
for Beowulf's coming to Hrothgar's aid.
heroes, as thy spirit urges_.--Kl. reaches the above translation by
erasing the comma after 'meoto' and reading 'sige-hreethsecgum.'--There
are other and bolder emendations and suggestions. Of these the boldest
is to regard 'meoto' as a verb (imperative), and read 'on sael': _Think
upon gayety, etc_.--All the renderings are unsatisfactory, the one
given in our translation involving a zeugma.
{Unferth, a thane of Hrothgar, is jealous of Beowulf, and undertakes to
twit him.}
Unferth spoke up, Ecglaf his son,
Who sat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings,
Opened the jousting (the journey[1] of Beowulf,
Sea-farer doughty, gave sorrow to Unferth
That any man else on earth should attain to,
Gain under heaven, more glory than he):
{Did you take part in a swimming-match with Breca?}
"Art thou that Beowulf with Breca did struggle,
On the wide sea-currents at swimming contended,
{'Twas mere folly that actuated you both to risk your lives on the ocean.}
From vainest vaunting adventured your bodies
In care of the waters? And no one was able
Nor lief nor loth one, in the least to dissuade you
Your difficult voyage; then ye ventured a-swimming,
The mere-ways measured, mixing and stirring them,
Glided the ocean; angry the waves were,
With the weltering of winter. In the water's possession,
Ye toiled for a seven-night; he at swimming outdid thee,
On the Heathoremes' shore the holm-currents tossed him,
Sought he thenceward the home of his fathers,
Beloved of his liegemen, the land of the Brondings,
The peace-castle pleasant, where a people he wielded,
{Breca outdid you entirely.}
The son of Beanstan hath soothly accomplished.
Then I ween thou wilt find thee less fortunate issue,
{Much more will Grendel outdo you, if you vie with him in prowess.}
Though ever triumphant in onset of battle,
A grim grappling, if Grendel thou darest
{Beowulf retaliates.}
Beowulf answered, offspring of Ecgtheow:
"My good friend Unferth, sure freely and wildly,
{O friend Unferth, you are fuddled with beer, and cannot talk coherently.}
Thou fuddled with beer of Breca hast spoken,
Hast told of his journey! A fact I allege it,
Ills in the ocean, than any man else had.
We made agreement as the merest of striplings
Promised each other (both of us then were
{We simply kept an engagement made in early life.}
Younkers in years) that we yet would adventure
While swimming the sea-floods, sword-blade unscabbarded
Boldly we brandished, our bodies expected
To shield from the sharks. He sure was unable
{He _could_ not excel me, and I _would_ not excel him.}
To swim on the waters further than I could,
Then we two companions stayed in the ocean
{After five days the currents separated us.}
Five nights together, till the currents did part us,
The weltering waters, weathers the bleakest,
And nethermost night, and the north-wind whistled
The mere fishes' mood was mightily ruffled:
And there against foemen my firm-knotted corslet,
Hand-jointed, hardy, help did afford me;
My battle-sark braided, brilliantly gilded,
{A horrible sea-beast attacked me, but I slew him.}
A hateful fiend-scather, seized me and held me,
Grim in his grapple: 'twas granted me, nathless,
To pierce the monster with the point of my weapon,
My obedient blade; battle offcarried
means 'arrival.' If so, translate the bracket: _(the arrival of
Beowulf, the brave seafarer, was a source of great chagrin to Unferth,
etc.)_.
"So ill-meaning enemies often did cause me
Sorrow the sorest. I served them, in quittance,
{My dear sword always served me faithfully.}
With my dear-loved sword, as in sooth it was fitting;
They missed the pleasure of feasting abundantly,
Of surrounding the banquet deep in the ocean;
But wounded with edges early at morning
They were stretched a-high on the strand of the ocean,
{I put a stop to the outrages of the sea-monsters.}
Put to sleep with the sword, that sea-going travelers
The foam-dashing currents. Came a light from the east,
God's beautiful beacon; the billows subsided,
That well I could see the nesses projecting,
{Fortune helps the brave earl.}
The blustering crags. Weird often saveth
But me did it fortune[1] to fell with my weapon
Nine of the nickers. Of night-struggle harder
'Neath dome of the heaven heard I but rarely,
Nor of wight more woful in the waves of the ocean;
{After that escape I drifted to Finland.}
Weary from travel. Then the waters bare me
To the land of the Finns, the flood with the current,
{I have never heard of your doing any such bold deeds.}
The weltering waves. Not a word hath been told me
Of deeds so daring done by thee, Unferth,
At the play of the battle, nor either of you two,
Feat so fearless performed with weapons
Glinting and gleaming . . . . . . . . . . . .
{You are a slayer of brothers, and will suffer damnation, wise as you may
be.}
Thy nearest of kin; thou needs must in hell get
Direful damnation, though doughty thy wisdom.
I tell thee in earnest, offspring of Ecglaf,
Never had Grendel such numberless horrors,
Harrying in Heorot, if thy heart were as sturdy,
{Had your acts been as brave as your words, Grendel had not ravaged your
land so long.}
Thy mood as ferocious as thou dost describe them.
He hath found out fully that the fierce-burning hatred,
The edge-battle eager, of all of your kindred,
Oaths he exacteth, not any he spares
{The monster is not afraid of the Danes,}
Of the folk of the Danemen, but fighteth with pleasure,
Killeth and feasteth, no contest expecteth
{but he will soon learn to dread the Geats.}
From Spear-Danish people. But the prowess and valor
To give him a grapple. He shall go who is able
Bravely to banquet, when the bright-light of morning
{On the second day, any warrior may go unmolested to the mead-banquet.}
Which the second day bringeth, the sun in its ether-robes,
O'er children of men shines from the southward!"
{Hrothgar's spirits are revived.}
Was blithesome and joyous, the Bright-Danish ruler
Expected assistance; the people's protector
{The old king trusts Beowulf. The heroes are joyful.}
Heard from Beowulf his bold resolution.
There was laughter of heroes; loud was the clatter,
{Queen Wealhtheow plays the hostess.}
Consort of Hrothgar, of courtesy mindful,
Gold-decked saluted the men in the building,
And the freeborn woman the beaker presented
{She offers the cup to her husband first.}
To the lord of the kingdom, first of the East-Danes,
Lief to his liegemen; he lustily tasted
Of banquet and beaker, battle-famed ruler.
The Helmingish lady then graciously circled
'Mid all the liegemen lesser and greater:
{She gives presents to the heroes.}
That the decorous-mooded, diademed folk-queen
{Then she offers the cup to Beowulf, thanking God that aid has come.}
Might bear to Beowulf the bumper o'errunning;
She greeted the Geat-prince, God she did thank,
Most wise in her words, that her wish was accomplished,
Solace in sorrow. He accepted the beaker,
Battle-bold warrior, at Wealhtheow's giving,
{Beowulf states to the queen the object of his visit.}
Then equipped for combat quoth he in measures,
Beowulf spake, offspring of Ecgtheow:
{I determined to do or die.}
When I boarded my boat with a band of my liegemen,
I would work to the fullest the will of your people
Or in foe's-clutches fastened fall in the battle.
Deeds I shall do of daring and prowess,
These words to the lady were welcome and pleasing,
The boast of the Geatman; with gold trappings broidered
Went the freeborn folk-queen her fond-lord to sit by.
{Glee is high.}
Then again as of yore was heard in the building
Heroes were happy, till Healfdene's son would
Go to his slumber to seek for refreshing;
For the horrid hell-monster in the hall-building knew he
A fight was determined,[2] since the light of the sun they
O'er all had descended, and dark under heaven
Shadowy shapes came shying around them.
{Hrothgar retires, leaving Beowulf in charge of the hall.}
The liegemen all rose then. One saluted the other,
Hrothgar Beowulf, in rhythmical measures,
To his care and keeping, quoth he departing:
But thee and thee only, the hall of the Danemen,
Since high I could heave my hand and my buckler.
Be mindful of honor, exhibiting prowess,
Watch 'gainst the foeman! Thou shalt want no enjoyments,
Survive thou safely adventure so glorious!"

it befell me, etc._ Another suggestion is to change the second
'hwaeethere' into 'swa Þaer': _So there I escaped with my life, etc._
passage as follows: _Since they no longer could see the light of the
sun, and lowering darkness was down over all, dire under the heavens
shadowy beings came going around them_.
{Hrothgar retires.}
Then Hrothgar departed, his earl-throng attending him,
Folk-lord of Scyldings, forth from the building;
The war-chieftain wished then Wealhtheow to look for,
The queen for a bedmate. To keep away Grendel
{God has provided a watch for the hall.}
As men heard recounted: for the king of the Danemen
He did special service, gave the giant a watcher:
And the prince of the Geatmen implicitly trusted
{Beowulf is self-confident}
His warlike strength and the Wielder's protection.
{He prepares for rest.}
His helmet from his head, to his henchman committed
His chased-handled chain-sword, choicest of weapons,
And bade him bide with his battle-equipments.
The good one then uttered words of defiance,
{Beowulf boasts of his ability to cope with Grendel.}
"I hold me no meaner in matters of prowess,
In warlike achievements, than Grendel does himself;
Hence I seek not with sword-edge to sooth him to slumber,
Of life to bereave him, though well I am able.
{We will fight with nature's weapons only.}
To shatter my shield, though sure he is mighty
Shall do without edges, dare he to look for
Weaponless warfare, and wise-mooded Father
{God may decide who shall conquer}
On which hand soever to him seemeth proper."
Then the brave-mooded hero bent to his slumber,
The pillow received the cheek of the noble;
{The Geatish warriors lie down.}
And many a martial mere-thane attending
{They thought it very unlikely that they should ever see their homes
again.}
That ever thereafter any should hope to
Be happy at home, hero-friends visit
Or the lordly troop-castle where he lived from his childhood;
They had heard how slaughter had snatched from the wine-hall,
{But God raised up a deliverer.}
Too many by far. But the Lord to them granted
The weaving of war-speed, to Wederish heroes
Aid and comfort, that every opponent
By one man's war-might they worsted and vanquished,
{God rules the world.}
That God Almighty hath governed for ages
Kindreds and nations. A night very lurid
{Grendel comes to Heorot.}
The trav'ler-at-twilight came tramping and striding.
The warriors were sleeping who should watch the horned-building,
{Only one warrior is awake.}
Th' implacable foeman was powerless to hurl them
To the land of shadows, if the Lord were unwilling;
But serving as warder, in terror to foemen,
He angrily bided the issue of battle.[2]

Grendel, though mighty and formidable, has no skill in the art of war.
the division usually made at this point, 'Þa.' (711), usually rendered
'then,' he translates 'when,' and connects its clause with the
foregoing sentence. These changes he makes to reduce the number of
'com's' as principal verbs. (Cf. 703, 711, 721.) With all deference to
this acute scholar, I must say that it seems to me that the poet is
exhausting his resources to bring out clearly the supreme event on
which the whole subsequent action turns. First, he (Grendel) came _in
the wan night_; second, he came _from the moor_; third, he came _to
the hall_. Time, place from which, place to which, are all given.
{Grendel comes from the fens.}
'Neath the cloudy cliffs came from the moor then
Grendel going, God's anger bare he.
The monster intended some one of earthmen
In the hall-building grand to entrap and make way with:
{He goes towards the joyous building.}
The wine-joyous building, brilliant with plating,
Gold-hall of earthmen. Not the earliest occasion
{This was not his first visit there.}
He the home and manor of Hrothgar had sought:
Ne'er found he in life-days later nor earlier
Then came to the building the warrior marching,
{His horrid fingers tear the door open.}
Bereft of his joyance. The door quickly opened
On fire-hinges fastened, when his fingers had touched it;
The fell one had flung then--his fury so bitter--
The foeman trod the shining hall-pavement,
{He strides furiously into the hall.}
Strode he angrily; from the eyes of him glimmered
A lustre unlovely likest to fire.
He beheld in the hall the heroes in numbers,
{He exults over his supposed prey.}
A throng of thanemen: then his thoughts were exultant,
He minded to sunder from each of the thanemen
The life from his body, horrible demon,
Ere morning came, since fate had allowed him
{Fate has decreed that he shall devour no more heroes. Beowulf suffers
from suspense.}
To permit him any more of men under heaven
To eat in the night-time. Higelac's kinsman
Great sorrow endured how the dire-mooded creature
{Grendel immediately seizes a sleeping warrior, and devours him.}
But on earliest occasion he quickly laid hold of
A soldier asleep, suddenly tore him,
Bit his bone-prison, the blood drank in currents,
Swallowed in mouthfuls: he soon had the dead man's
Nearer he strode then, the stout-hearted warrior
{Beowulf and Grendel grapple.}
Snatched as he slumbered, seizing with hand-grip,
Forward the foeman foined with his hand;
Caught he quickly the cunning deviser,
The master of malice, that in middle-earth's regions,
'Neath the whole of the heavens, no hand-grapple greater
{The monster is amazed at Beowulf's strength.}
In any man else had he ever encountered:
Fearful in spirit, faint-mooded waxed he,
{He is anxious to flee.}
Would fly to his covert, seek the devils' assembly:
His calling no more was the same he had followed
Long in his lifetime. The liege-kinsman worthy
{Beowulf recalls his boast of the evening, and determines to fulfil it.}
Of Higelac minded his speech of the evening,
His fingers crackled; the giant was outward,
The earl stepped farther. The famous one minded
To flee away farther, if he found an occasion,
And off and away, avoiding delay,
The strength of his grapple in the grip of the foeman.
{'Twas a luckless day for Grendel.}
'Twas an ill-taken journey that the injury-bringing,
Harrying harmer to Heorot wandered:
{The hall groans.}
The palace re-echoed; to all of the Danemen,
Earlmen, was terror. Angry they both were,
Archwarders raging.[2] Rattled the building;
The bold-in-battle, bent not to earthward,
Was fastened so firmly in fetters of iron,
By the art of the armorer. Off from the sill there
Bent mead-benches many, as men have informed me,
Adorned with gold-work, where the grim ones did struggle.
That by might and main-strength a man under heaven
Might break it in pieces, bone-decked, resplendent,
Crush it by cunning, unless clutch of the fire
In smoke should consume it. The sound mounted upward
{Grendel's cries terrify the Danes.}
A terror of anguish, on all of the men there
Who heard from the wall the weeping and plaining,
The song of defeat from the foeman of heaven,
Heard him hymns of horror howl, and his sorrow
Who was strongest of main-strength of men of that era.
life, earlier or later, had he, the hell-thane, found a braver
hero_.--They argue that Beowulf's companions had done nothing to merit
such encomiums as the usual readings allow them.
Translate: _They were both angry, raging and mighty_.
{Beowulf has no idea of letting Grendel live.}
For no cause whatever would the earlmen's defender
Leave in life-joys the loathsome newcomer,
He deemed his existence utterly useless
To men under heaven. Many a noble
Would guard the life of his lord and protector,
The far-famous chieftain, if able to do so;
While waging the warfare, this wist they but little,
Brave battle-thanes, while his body intending
{No weapon would harm Grendel; he bore a charmed life.}
That the relentless foeman nor finest of weapons
Of all on the earth, nor any of war-bills
Swords and suchlike he had sworn to dispense with.
And the far-away spirit widely should journey
Into enemies' power. This plainly he saw then
Who with mirth[1] of mood malice no little
Had wrought in the past on the race of the earthmen
But Higelac's hardy henchman and kinsman
Held him by the hand; hateful to other
{Grendel is sorely wounded.}
Was each one if living. A body-wound suffered
The direful demon, damage incurable
{His body bursts.}
His body did burst. To Beowulf was given
Glory in battle; Grendel from thenceward
Must flee and hide him in the fen-cliffs and marshes,
Sick unto death, his dwelling must look for
{The monster flees away to hide in the moors.}
The end of his earthly existence was nearing,
His life-days' limits. At last for the Danemen,
When the slaughter was over, their wish was accomplished.
The comer-from-far-land had cleansed then of evil,
Saved it from violence. He joyed in the night-work,
In repute for prowess; the prince of the Geatmen
For the East-Danish people his boast had accomplished,
Bettered their burdensome bale-sorrows fully,
And were forced to endure from crushing oppression,
Their manifold misery. 'Twas a manifest token,
{Beowulf suspends Grendel's hand and arm in Heorot.}
When the hero-in-battle the hand suspended,
The arm and the shoulder (there was all of the claw
there seems no authority for such a rendering. To the present
translator, the phrase 'modes myrethe' seems a mere padding for
_gladly_; i.e., _he who gladly harassed mankind_.
{At early dawn, warriors from far and near come together to hear of the
night's adventures.}
In the mist of the morning many a warrior
Stood round the gift-hall, as the story is told me:
Folk-princes fared then from far and from near
Through long-stretching journeys to look at the wonder,
{Few warriors lamented Grendel's destruction.}
Who gazed on the foot-tracks of the inglorious creature
His parting from life pained very deeply,
How, weary in spirit, off from those regions
In combats conquered he carried his traces,
{Grendel's blood dyes the waters.}
There in bloody billows bubbled the currents,
The angry eddy was everywhere mingled
And seething with gore, welling with sword-blood;[1]
He death-doomed had hid him, when reaved of his joyance
His heathenish spirit, where hell did receive him.
Thence the friends from of old backward turned them,
And many a younker from merry adventure,
Striding their stallions, stout from the seaward,
{Beowulf is the hero of the hour.}
Beowulf's praises; many often asserted
That neither south nor north, in the circuit of waters,
{He is regarded as a probable successor to Hrothgar.}
O'er outstretching earth-plain, none other was better
'Mid bearers of war-shields, more worthy to govern,
'Gainst the friend-lord muttered, mocking-words uttered
{But no word is uttered to derogate from the old king}
Of Hrothgar the gracious (a good king he).
Oft the famed ones permitted their fallow-skinned horses
Known for their excellence; oft a thane of the folk-lord,[2]
{The gleeman sings the deeds of heroes.}
Who ancient traditions treasured in memory,
New word-groups found properly bound:
{He sings in alliterative measures of Beowulf's prowess.}
Wisely to tell of, and words that were clever
To utter skilfully, earnestly speaking,
Everything told he that he heard as to Sigmund's
{Also of Sigemund, who has slain a great fire-dragon.}
Mighty achievements, many things hidden,
The children of men knew of but little,
The feud and the fury, but Fitela with him,
When suchlike matters he minded to speak of,
Uncle to nephew, as in every contention
A numerous host of the race of the scathers
They had slain with the sword-edge. To Sigmund accrued then
No little of glory, when his life-days were over,
Since he sturdy in struggle had destroyed the great dragon,
The son of the atheling, unaided adventured
The perilous project; not present was Fitela,
Yet the fortune befell him of forcing his weapon
Through the marvellous dragon, that it stood in the wall,
The great one had gained then by his glorious achievement
To reap from the ring-hoard richest enjoyment,
Shining ornaments on the ship's bosom carried,
{Sigemund was widely famed.}
He was farthest famed of fugitive pilgrims,
Mid wide-scattered world-folk, for works of great prowess,
War-troopers' shelter: hence waxed he in honor.[4]
{Heremod, an unfortunate Danish king, is introduced by way of contrast.}
Afterward Heremod's hero-strength failed him,
To the hands of foemen he was foully delivered,
Offdriven early. Agony-billows
{Unlike Sigemund and Beowulf, Heremod was a burden to his people.}
Oppressed him too long, to his people he became then,
To all the athelings, an ever-great burden;
Many wise men were wont to deplore,
Such as hoped he would bring them help in their sorrow,
That the son of their ruler should rise into power,
Holding the headship held by his fathers,
The kingdom of heroes, the realm of the Scyldings.
{Beowulf is an honor to his race.}
He to all men became then far more beloved,
Higelac's kinsman, to kindreds and races,
To his friends much dearer; him malice assaulted.--
{The story is resumed.}
The dun-colored highways. Then the light of the morning
Was hurried and hastened. Went henchmen in numbers
To the beautiful building, bold ones in spirit,
To look at the wonder; the liegelord himself then
Glorious trod with troopers unnumbered,
Famed for his virtues, and with him the queen-wife

Hrothgar discoursed (to the hall-building went he,
He stood by the pillar,[1] saw the steep-rising hall-roof
Gleaming with gold-gems, and Grendel his hand there):
{Hrothgar gives thanks for the overthrow of the monster.}
"For the sight we behold now, thanks to the Wielder
Snaring from Grendel:[2] God can e'er 'complish
Wonder on wonder, Wielder of Glory!
{I had given up all hope, when this brave liegeman came to our aid.}
But lately I reckoned ne'er under heaven
Comfort to gain me for any of sorrows,
Gory uptowered; grief had offfrightened[3]
Each of the wise ones who weened not that ever
The folk-troop's defences 'gainst foes they should strengthen,
'Gainst sprites and monsters. Through the might of the Wielder
Which erstwhile we all with our excellent wisdom
{If his mother yet liveth, well may she thank God for this son.}
Failed to perform. May affirm very truly
What woman soever in all of the nations
Gave birth to the child, if yet she surviveth,
In the birth of the bairn. Now, Beowulf dear,
{Hereafter, Beowulf, thou shalt be my son.}
Most excellent hero, I'll love thee in spirit
As bairn of my body; bear well henceforward
The relationship new. No lack shall befall thee
Full often for lesser service I've given
{Thou hast won immortal distinction.}
To a weaker in war-strife. By works of distinction
Thou hast gained for thyself now that thy glory shall flourish
With good from His hand as He hitherto did thee!"
{Beowulf replies: I was most happy to render thee this service.}
Beowulf answered, Ecgtheow's offspring:
"That labor of glory most gladly achieved we,
The combat accomplished, unquailing we ventured
Thou wert able to look at the creature in person,
Faint unto falling, the foe in his trappings!
On murder-bed quickly I minded to bind him,
With firm-holding fetters, that forced by my grapple
'Less his body escape; I was wholly unable,
{I could not keep the monster from escaping, as God did not will that I
should.}
Since God did not will it, to keep him from going,
Not held him that firmly, hated opposer;
Too swift was the foeman. Yet safety regarding
His arm and shoulder, to act as watcher;
{He left his hand and arm behind.}
No shadow of solace the woe-begone creature
Found him there nathless: the hated destroyer
Liveth no longer, lashed for his evils,
Close in its clutches, keepeth him writhing
In baleful bonds: there banished for evil
The man shall wait for the mighty tribunal,
{God will give him his deserts.}
How the God of glory shall give him his earnings."
{Unferth has nothing more to say, for Beowulf's actions speak louder than
words.}
From boasting and bragging of battle-achievements,
Since the princes beheld there the hand that depended
'Neath the lofty hall-timbers by the might of the nobleman,
Each one before him, the enemy's fingers;
The heathen one's hand-spur, the hero-in-battle's
Claw most uncanny; quoth they agreeing,

{Heorot is adorned with hands.}
Then straight was ordered that Heorot inside[1]
With hands be embellished: a host of them gathered,
Of men and women, who the wassailing-building
The guest-hall begeared. Gold-flashing sparkled
To each of the heroes that look on such objects.
{The hall is defaced, however.}
The beautiful building was broken to pieces
Which all within with irons was fastened,
Its hinges torn off: only the roof was
Outlawed for evil off had betaken him,
Hopeless of living. 'Tis hard to avoid it

(Whoever will do it!); but he doubtless must come to[2]
The place awaiting, as Wyrd hath appointed,
Where bound on its bed his body shall slumber

When feasting is finished. Full was the time then
That the son of Healfdene went to the building;
Bare them better tow'rds their bracelet-bestower.
The laden-with-glory stooped to the bench then
(Their kinsmen-companions in plenty were joyful,
Many a cupful quaffing complaisantly),
{Hrothgar's nephew, Hrothulf, is present.}
Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot then inside
Was filled with friendly ones; falsehood and treachery
The Folk-Scyldings now nowise did practise.
{Hrothgar lavishes gifts upon Beowulf.}
Then the offspring of Healfdene offered to Beowulf
A banner embossed, burnie and helmet;
Many men saw then a song-famous weapon
Borne 'fore the hero. Beowulf drank of
The cup in the building; that treasure-bestowing
{Four handsomer gifts were never presented.}
Ne'er heard I that many men on the ale-bench
In friendlier fashion to their fellows presented
Four bright jewels with gold-work embellished.
'Round the roof of the helmet a head-guarder outside
That swords-for-the-battle fight-hardened might fail
Boldly to harm him, when the hero proceeded
{Hrothgar commands that eight finely caparisoned steeds be brought to
Beowulf.}
Forth against foemen. The defender of earls then
Commanded that eight steeds with bridles
Inside the building; on one of them stood then
An art-broidered saddle embellished with jewels;
'Twas the sovereign's seat, when the son of King Healfdene
Was pleased to take part in the play of the edges;
Slain ones were bowing. And to Beowulf granted
The prince of the Ingwins, power over both,
O'er war-steeds and weapons; bade him well to enjoy them.
In so manly a manner the mighty-famed chieftain,
War-storms requited, that none e'er condemneth
Who willeth to tell truth with full justice.

affording a parallel to 'gefraetwod': both have the disadvantage of
altering the text.

BANQUET (_continued_).--THE SCOP'S SONG OF FINN AND HNAEF.
{Each of Beowulf's companions receives a costly gift.}
And the atheling of earlmen to each of the heroes
Who the ways of the waters went with Beowulf,
A costly gift-token gave on the mead-bench,
Offered an heirloom, and ordered that that man
{The warrior killed by Grendel is to be paid for in gold.}
Wickedly slaughtered, as he more of them had done
Had far-seeing God and the mood of the hero
The fate not averted: the Father then governed
All of the earth-dwellers, as He ever is doing;
Forethought of spirit! much he shall suffer
Of lief and of loathsome who long in this present
Useth the world in this woful existence.
There was music and merriment mingling together
{Hrothgar's scop recalls events in the reign of his lord's father.}
Measures recited, when the singer of Hrothgar
On mead-bench should mention the merry hall-joyance
Of the kinsmen of Finn, when onset surprised them:
{Hnaef, the Danish general, is treacherously attacked while staying at
Finn's castle.}
"The Half-Danish hero, Hnaef of the Scyldings,
Sure Hildeburg needed not mention approving
The faith of the Jutemen: though blameless entirely,
{Queen Hildeburg is not only wife of Finn, but a kinswoman of the murdered
Hnaef.}
When shields were shivered she was shorn of her darlings,
Of bairns and brothers: they bent to their fate
Not causeless lamented the daughter of Hoce
The decree of the Wielder when morning-light came and
She was able 'neath heaven to behold the destruction
{Finn's force is almost exterminated.}
War had offtaken, save a handful remaining,
That he nowise was able to offer resistance[1]
{Hengest succeeds Hnaef as Danish general.}
To the onset of Hengest in the parley of battle,
Nor the wretched remnant to rescue in war from
{Compact between the Frisians and the Danes.}
Another great building to fully make ready,
A hall and a high-seat, that half they might rule with
The sons of the Jutemen, and that Folcwalda's son would
Day after day the Danemen honor
To Hengest's earl-troop ever so freely,
Of his gold-plated jewels, as he encouraged the Frisians
{Equality of gifts agreed on.}
On the bench of the beer-hall. On both sides they swore then
A fast-binding compact; Finn unto Hengest
The woe-begone remnant well to take charge of,
His Witan advising; the agreement should no one
By words or works weaken and shatter,
By artifice ever injure its value,
They followed as vassals, Fate so requiring:
{No one shall refer to old grudges.}
Then if one of the Frisians the quarrel should speak of
In tones that were taunting, terrible edges
Should cut in requital. Accomplished the oath was,
{Danish warriors are burned on a funeral-pyre.}
The best of the Scylding braves was then fully
Prepared for the pile; at the pyre was seen clearly
The blood-gory burnie, the boar with his gilding,
The iron-hard swine, athelings many
Hildeburg bade then, at the burning of Hnaef,
{Queen Hildeburg has her son burnt along with Hnaef.}
The bairn of her bosom to bear to the fire,
That his body be burned and borne to the pyre.
The woe-stricken woman wept on his shoulder,[2]
The greatest of dead-fires curled to the welkin,
On the hill's-front crackled; heads were a-melting,
Wound-doors bursting, while the blood was a-coursing
From body-bite fierce. The fire devoured them,
From both of the peoples; their bravest were fallen.
'wieth Hengeste wiht gefeohtan.' Neither emendation would make any
essential change in the translation.
being very unusual, some scholars have put 'earme on eaxle' with the
foregoing lines, inserting a semicolon after 'eaxle.' In this case 'on
eaxe' (_i.e._, on the ashes, cinders) is sometimes read, and this
affords a parallel to 'on bael.' Let us hope that a satisfactory
rendering shall yet be reached without resorting to any tampering with
the text, such as Lichtenheld proposed: 'earme ides on eaxle
gnornode.'
THE FINN EPISODE (_continued_).--THE BANQUET CONTINUES.
{The survivors go to Friesland, the home of Finn.}
"Then the warriors departed to go to their dwellings,
Reaved of their friends, Friesland to visit,
Their homes and high-city. Hengest continued
{Hengest remains there all winter, unable to get away.}
Biding with Finn the blood-tainted winter,
Though unable to drive the ring-stemmed vessel
Fought with the wind; winter in ice-bonds
Closed up the currents, till there came to the dwelling
If season propitious one alway regardeth,
World-cheering weathers. Then winter was gone,
Earth's bosom was lovely; the exile would get him,
{He devises schemes of vengeance.}
The guest from the palace; on grewsomest vengeance
Whe'r onset-of-anger he were able to 'complish,
The bairns of the Jutemen therein to remember.
Nowise refused he the duties of liegeman
When Hun of the Frisians the battle-sword Lafing,
Its edges were famous in folk-talk of Jutland.
And savage sword-fury seized in its clutches
Bold-mooded Finn where he bode in his palace,
{Guthlaf and Oslaf revenge Hnaef's slaughter.}
When the grewsome grapple Guthlaf and Oslaf
For sorrows half-blamed him; the flickering spirit
Could not bide in his bosom. Then the building was covered[2]
{Finn is slain.}
With corpses of foemen, and Finn too was slaughtered,
The king with his comrades, and the queen made a prisoner.
{The jewels of Finn, and his queen are carried away by the Danes.}
All that the land-king had in his palace,
Such trinkets and treasures they took as, on searching,
At Finn's they could find. They ferried to Daneland
The excellent woman on oversea journey,
{The lay is concluded, and the main story is resumed.}
The gleeman's recital. Shouts again rose then,
Bench-glee resounded, bearers then offered
{Skinkers carry round the beaker.}
Wine from wonder-vats. Wealhtheo advanced then
Going 'neath gold-crown, where the good ones were seated
{Queen Wealhtheow greets Hrothgar, as he sits beside Hrothulf, his
nephew.}
True each to the other. And Unferth the spokesman
Sat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings:
Each trusted his spirit that his mood was courageous,
Though at fight he had failed in faith to his kinsmen.
Treasure-bestower, take thou this beaker;
Joyance attend thee, gold-friend of heroes,
{Be generous to the Geats.}
And greet thou the Geatmen with gracious responses!
So ought one to do. Be kind to the Geatmen,
Peace thou enjoyest. Report hath informed me
Thou'lt have for a bairn the battle-brave hero.
Now is Heorot cleansed, ring-palace gleaming;
{Have as much joy as possible in thy hall, once more purified.}
Give while thou mayest many rewards,
On wending thy way to the Wielder's splendor.
I know good Hrothulf, that the noble young troopers
{I know that Hrothulf will prove faithful if he survive thee.}
He'll care for and honor, lord of the Scyldings,
If earth-joys thou endest earlier than he doth;
Our offspring and issue, if that all he remember,
What favors of yore, when he yet was an infant,
We awarded to him for his worship and pleasure."
Then she turned by the bench where her sons were carousing,
{Beowulf is sitting by the two royal sons.}
The war-youth together; there the good one was sitting
'Twixt the brothers twain, Beowulf Geatman.
The latter verse is undisputed; and, for the former, 'elne' would be
as possible as 'ealles,' and 'unflitme' is well supported. Accepting
'elne unflitme' for both, I would suggest '_very peaceably_' for both
places: (1) _Finn to Hengest very peaceably vowed with oaths_, etc.
(2) _Hengest then still the slaughter-stained winter remained there
with Finn very peaceably_. The two passages become thus correlatives,
the second a sequel of the first. 'Elne,' in the sense of very
(swiethe), needs no argument; and 'unflitme' (from 'flitan') can, it
seems to me, be more plausibly rendered 'peaceful,' 'peaceable,' than
'contestable,' or 'conquerable.'
_Then the building was reddened, etc._, instead of 'covered.' The 'h'
may have been carried over from the three alliterating 'h's.'
{More gifts are offered Beowulf.}
A beaker was borne him, and bidding to quaff it
Graciously given, and gold that was twisted
Pleasantly proffered, a pair of arm-jewels,
More splendid from jewels have I heard 'neath the welkin,
{A famous necklace is referred to, in comparison with the gems presented
to Beowulf.}
Since Hama off bore the Brosingmen's necklace,
The bracteates and jewels, from the bright-shining city,[1]
Eormenric's cunning craftiness fled from,
Grandson of Swerting, last had this jewel
When tramping 'neath banner the treasure he guarded,
The field-spoil defended; Fate offcarried him
When for deeds of daring he endured tribulation,
O'er the cup of the currents, costly gem-treasures,
Mighty folk-leader, he fell 'neath his target;
The[2] corpse of the king then came into charge of
The race of the Frankmen, the mail-shirt and collar:
When the fight was finished; the folk of the Geatmen
The field of the dead held in possession.
The choicest of mead-halls with cheering resounded.
Wealhtheo discoursed, the war-troop addressed she:
{Queen Wealhtheow magnifies Beowulf's achievements.}
Young man, in safety, and use thou this armor,
Gems of the people, and prosper thou fully,
Show thyself sturdy and be to these liegemen
Mild with instruction! I'll mind thy requital.
Forever and ever earthmen shall honor thee,
Even so widely as ocean surroundeth
The blustering bluffs. Be, while thou livest,
{May gifts never fail thee.}
Living in joyance! Here each of the nobles
Is true unto other, gentle in spirit,
Loyal to leader. The liegemen are peaceful,
The war-troops ready: well-drunken heroes,[3]
There was choicest of banquets, wine drank the heroes:
{They little know of the sorrow in store for them.}
Weird they knew not, destiny cruel,
As to many an earlman early it happened,
When evening had come and Hrothgar had parted
Warriors unnumbered warded the building
As erst they did often: the ale-settle bared they,
'Twas covered all over with beds and pillows.
{A doomed thane is there with them.}
Doomed unto death, down to his slumber
Bright-shining targets, up by their heads then;
O'er the atheling on ale-bench 'twas easy to see there
Battle-high helmet, burnie of ring-mail,
{They were always ready for battle.}
And mighty war-spear. 'Twas the wont of that people
At home or marching--in either condition--
At seasons just such as necessity ordered
As best for their ruler; that people was worthy.

reading than one joining, in such intimate syntactical relations,
things so unlike as 'corpse' and 'jewels.'
without departing seriously from the H.-So. text. 'Oft' frequently
means 'constantly,' 'continually,' not always 'often.'--Why 'an (on)
wig gearwe' should be written 'anwig-gearwe' (= ready for single
combat), I cannot see. 'Gearwe' occurs quite frequently with 'on'; cf.

journey_). Moreover, what has the idea of single combat to do with B.
they lay aside on retiring, and he closes his narration by saying that
they were _always prepared for battle both at home and on the march_.
They sank then to slumber. With sorrow one paid for
His evening repose, as often betid them
While Grendel was holding[1] the gold-bedecked palace,
Ill-deeds performing, till his end overtook him,
{Grendel's mother is known to be thirsting for revenge.}
Known unto earth-folk, that still an avenger
Outlived the loathed one, long since the sorrow
Caused by the struggle; the mother of Grendel,
Devil-shaped woman, her woe ever minded,
{[Grendel's progenitor, Cain, is again referred to.]}
The cold-flowing currents, after Cain had become a
Slayer-with-edges to his one only brother,
The son of his sire; he set out then banished,
Marked as a murderer, man-joys avoiding,
{The poet again magnifies Beowulf's valor.}
Fate-sent awoke; one of them Grendel,
Sword-cursed, hateful, who at Heorot met with
A man that was watching, waiting the struggle,
Where a horrid one held him with hand-grapple sturdy;
The glorious gift God had allowed him,
And folk-ruling Father's favor relied on,
His help and His comfort: so he conquered the foeman,
The hell-spirit humbled: he unhappy departed then,
Foeman of man. His mother moreover
{Grendel's mother comes to avenge her son.}
Eager and gloomy was anxious to go on
Her mournful mission, mindful of vengeance
For the death of her son. She came then to Heorot
Were lying in slumber. Soon there became then
Return[2] to the nobles, when the mother of Grendel
Entered the folk-hall; the fear was less grievous
By even so much as the vigor of maidens,
When well-carved weapon, worked with the hammer,
Blade very bloody, brave with its edges,
Strikes down the boar-sign that stands on the helmet.
Then the hard-edged weapon was heaved in the building,[3]
Hand-fast were lifted; for helmet he recked not,
For armor-net broad, whom terror laid hold of.
She went then hastily, outward would get her
Her life for to save, when some one did spy her;
{She seizes a favorite liegemen of Hrothgar's.}
Fast and firmly, when fenward she hied her;
That one to Hrothgar was liefest of heroes
In rank of retainer where waters encircle,
A mighty shield-warrior, whom she murdered at slumber,
{Beowulf was asleep in another part of the palace.}
But another apartment was erstwhile devoted
To the glory-decked Geatman when gold was distributed.
There was hubbub in Heorot. The hand that was famous
She grasped in its gore;[4] grief was renewed then
In both of the quarters to barter and purchase
With lives of their friends. Then the well-aged ruler,
The gray-headed war-thane, was woful in spirit,
When his long-trusted liegeman lifeless he knew of,
{Beowulf is sent for.}
Beowulf brought, brave and triumphant.
As day was dawning in the dusk of the morning,
{He comes at Hrothgar's summons.}
Went then that earlman, champion noble,
Came with comrades, where the clever one bided
After the woe he had suffered. The war-worthy hero
With a troop of retainers trod then the pavement
(The hall-building groaned), till he greeted the wise one,
{Beowulf inquires how Hrothgar had enjoyed his night's rest.}
The earl of the Ingwins;[5] asked if the night had

baffles him in both passages. All we need is to take 'under' in its

_asked whether the night had been pleasant to him after
crushing-hostility_.
{Hrothgar laments the death of AEschere, his shoulder-companion.}
Hrothgar rejoined, helm of the Scyldings:
"Ask not of joyance! Grief is renewed to
The folk of the Danemen. Dead is AEschere,
Yrmenlaf's brother, older than he,
Shoulder-companion, when fighting in battle
Our heads we protected, when troopers were clashing,
{He was my ideal hero.}
And heroes were dashing; such an earl should be ever,
An erst-worthy atheling, as AEschere proved him.
His hand-to-hand murderer; I can not tell whither
The cruel one turned in the carcass exulting,
{This horrible creature came to avenge Grendel's death.}
By cramming discovered.[1] The quarrel she wreaked then,
That last night igone Grendel thou killedst
Since too long he had lessened my liege-troop and wasted
My folk-men so foully. He fell in the battle
With forfeit of life, and another has followed,
A mighty crime-worker, her kinsman avenging,
As it well may appear to many a liegeman,
Who mourneth in spirit the treasure-bestower,
Her heavy heart-sorrow; the hand is now lifeless
Which[3] availed you in every wish that you cherished.
{I have heard my vassals speak of these two uncanny monsters who lived in
the moors.}
Dwellers in halls, they had seen very often
A pair of such mighty march-striding creatures,
Far-dwelling spirits, holding the moorlands:
One of them wore, as well they might notice,
In guise of a man wandered in exile,
Except he was huger than any of earthmen;
Earth-dwelling people entitled him Grendel
In days of yore: they know not their father,
{The inhabit the most desolate and horrible places.}
Ever before. They guard the wolf-coverts,
Lands inaccessible, wind-beaten nesses,
Fearfullest fen-deeps, where a flood from the mountains
'Neath mists of the nesses netherward rattles,
Measured by mile-lengths that the mere-water standeth,
Which forests hang over, with frost-whiting covered,[4]
There ever at night one an ill-meaning portent
None liveth so wise that wot of the bottom;
Though harassed by hounds the heath-stepper seek for,
{Even the hounded deer will not seek refuge in these uncanny regions.}
Fly to the forest, firm-antlered he-deer,
Spurred from afar, his spirit he yieldeth,
To cover his head. Uncanny the place is:
Thence upward ascendeth the surging of waters,
Wan to the welkin, when the wind is stirring
The weathers unpleasing, till the air groweth gloomy,
{To thee only can I look for assistance.}
From thee and thee only! The abode thou know'st not,
The dangerous place where thou'rt able to meet with
The sin-laden hero: seek if thou darest!
For the feud I will fully fee thee with money,
With well-twisted jewels, if away thou shalt get thee."

So v. 1888, where 'se Þe' refers to 'yldo.'
(=hrinende), and translate: _which rustling forests overhang_.
Beowulf answered, Ecgtheow's son:
{Beowulf exhorts the old king to arouse himself for action.}
"Grieve not, O wise one! for each it is better,
His friend to avenge than with vehemence wail him;
Each of us must the end-day abide of
Glory ere death! To battle-thane noble
Lifeless lying, 'tis at last most fitting.
Arise, O king, quick let us hasten
To look at the footprint of the kinsman of Grendel!
To embrace of the earth, nor to mountainous forest,
Nor to depths of the ocean, wherever he wanders.
Of each of thy sorrows, as I hope for thee soothly!"
{Hrothgar rouses himself. His horse is brought.}
Ruler Almighty, that the man had outspoken.
Then for Hrothgar a war-horse was decked with a bridle,
Curly-maned courser. The clever folk-leader
{They start on the track of the female monster.}
Stately proceeded: stepped then an earl-troop
Widely in wood-paths, her way o'er the bottoms,
Where she faraway fared o'er fen-country murky,
Bore away breathless the best of retainers
Who pondered with Hrothgar the welfare of country.
Declivitous cliffs, the close-covered passes,
Narrow passages, paths unfrequented,
Nesses abrupt, nicker-haunts many;
One of a few of wise-mooded heroes,
Till he found unawares woods of the mountain
O'er hoar-stones hanging, holt-wood unjoyful;
The water stood under, welling and gory.
'Twas irksome in spirit to all of the Danemen,
{The sight of AEschere's head causes them great sorrow.}
Sad to be suffered, a sorrow unlittle
To each of the earlmen, when to AEschere's head they
Came on the cliff. The current was seething
With blood and with gore (the troopers gazed on it).
The troop were all seated; they saw 'long the water then
{The water is filled with serpents and sea-dragons.}
Many a serpent, mere-dragons wondrous
Trying the waters, nickers a-lying
On the cliffs of the nesses, which at noonday full often
Wild-beasts and wormkind; away then they hastened
{One of them is killed by Beowulf.}
Hot-mooded, hateful, they heard the great clamor,
The war-trumpet winding. One did the Geat-prince
{The dead beast is a poor swimmer}
Pierced to his vitals; he proved in the currents
Less doughty at swimming whom death had offcarried.
Soon in the waters the wonderful swimmer
Was straitened most sorely with sword-pointed boar-spears,
The liegemen then looked on the loath-fashioned stranger.
{Beowulf prepares for a struggle with the monster.}
Beowulf donned then his battle-equipments,
Cared little for life; inlaid and most ample,
The hand-woven corslet which could cover his body,
To harm the great hero, and the hating one's grasp might
Not peril his safety; his head was protected
By the light-flashing helmet that should mix with the bottoms,
Trying the eddies, treasure-emblazoned,
The weapon-smith worked it, wondrously made it,
With swine-bodies fashioned it, that thenceforward no longer
Brand might bite it, and battle-sword hurt it.
And that was not least of helpers in prowess
{He has Unferth's sword in his hand.}
And the hilted hand-sword was Hrunting entitled,
Old and most excellent 'mong all of the treasures;
Its blade was of iron, blotted with poison,
Hardened with gore; it failed not in battle
Who ventured to take the terrible journeys,
The battle-field sought; not the earliest occasion
That deeds of daring 'twas destined to 'complish.
{Unferth has little use for swords.}
Ecglaf's kinsman minded not soothly,
Drunken with wine, when the weapon he lent to
A sword-hero bolder; himself did not venture
'Neath the strife of the currents his life to endanger,
When he clad in his corslet had equipped him for battle.
{Beowulf makes a parting speech to Hrothgar.}
Beowulf spake, Ecgtheow's son:
"Recall now, oh, famous kinsman of Healfdene,
Prince very prudent, now to part I am ready,
Gold-friend of earlmen, what erst we agreed on,
{If I fail, act as a kind liegelord to my thanes,}
When my earth-joys were over, thou wouldst evermore serve me
In stead of a father; my faithful thanemen,
My trusty retainers, protect thou and care for,
Fall I in battle: and, Hrothgar beloved,
{and send Higelac the jewels thou hast given me}
Thou to me hast allotted. The lord of the Geatmen
May perceive from the gold, the Hrethling may see it
{I should like my king to know how generous a lord I found thee to be.}
When he looks on the jewels, that a gem-giver found I
Good over-measure, enjoyed him while able.
The famed one to have, the heavy-sword splendid[1]
The hard-edged weapon; with Hrunting to aid me,
I shall gain me glory, or grim-death shall take me."
{Beowulf is eager for the fray.}
The atheling of Geatmen uttered these words and
Was willing to wait for; the wave-current swallowed
{He is a whole day reaching the bottom of the sea.}
The doughty-in-battle. Then a day's-length elapsed ere
He was able to see the sea at its bottom.
Early she found then who fifty of winters
Grisly and greedy, that the grim one's dominion
{Grendel's mother knows that some one has reached her domains.}
Some one of men from above was exploring.
Forth did she grab them, grappled the warrior
With horrible clutches; yet no sooner she injured
That she proved but powerless to pierce through the armor,
The limb-mail locked, with loath-grabbing fingers.
The sea-wolf bare then, when bottomward came she,
{She grabs him, and bears him to her den.}
The ring-prince homeward, that he after was powerless
But many a mere-beast tormented him swimming,
{Sea-monsters bite and strike him.}
Flood-beasts no few with fierce-biting tusks did
Break through his burnie, the brave one pursued they.
The earl then discovered he was down in some cavern
And the clutch of the current could come not anear him,
Since the roofed-hall prevented; brightness a-gleaming
Fire-light he saw, flashing resplendent.
The good one saw then the sea-bottom's monster,
{Beowulf attacks the mother of Grendel.}
With weapon-of-battle, his hand not desisted
From striking, that war-blade struck on her head then
A battle-song greedy. The stranger perceived then
{The sword will not bite.}
The sword would not bite, her life would not injure,
Erst had it often onsets encountered,
Oft cloven the helmet, the fated one's armor:
'Twas the first time that ever the excellent jewel
Had failed of its fame. Firm-mooded after,
Was Higelac's kinsman; the hero-chief angry
Cast then his carved-sword covered with jewels
That it lay on the earth, hard and steel-pointed;
{The hero throws down all weapons, and again trusts to his hand-grip.}
He hoped in his strength, his hand-grapple sturdy.
To gain him in battle glory unending,
And is reckless of living. The lord of the War-Geats
The mother of Grendel; then mighty in struggle
That she fell to the floor. With furious grapple
{Beowulf falls.}
She gave him requital[3] early thereafter,
And stretched out to grab him; the strongest of warriors
Faint-mooded stumbled, till he fell in his traces,
{The monster sits on him with drawn sword.}
And wielded her war-knife wide-bladed, flashing,
For her son would take vengeance, her one only bairn.
{His armor saves his life.}
His breast-armor woven bode on his shoulder;
It guarded his life, the entrance defended
Had fatally journeyed, champion of Geatmen,
In the arms of the ocean, had the armor not given,
Close-woven corslet, comfort and succor,
{God arranged for his escape.}
And had God most holy not awarded the victory,
Ruler most righteous arrange it with justice;[4]
Uprose he erect ready for battle.

read: _She hand-reward gave him early thereafter_.
translate: _The Ruler of Heaven arranged it in justice easily, after
he arose again_.
{Beowulf grasps a giant-sword,}
Then he saw mid the war-gems a weapon of victory,
An ancient giant-sword, of edges a-doughty,
Glory of warriors: of weapons 'twas choicest,
Only 'twas larger than any man else was
The good and splendid work of the giants.
He grasped then the sword-hilt, knight of the Scyldings,
Bold and battle-grim, brandished his ring-sword,
Hopeless of living, hotly he smote her,
{and fells the female monster.}
Broke through her bone-joints, the bill fully pierced her
Fate-cursed body, she fell to the ground then:
The hand-sword was bloody, the hero exulted.
The brand was brilliant, brightly it glimmered,
The torch of the firmament. He glanced 'long the building,
And turned by the wall then, Higelac's vassal
Raging and wrathful raised his battle-sword
Strong by the handle. The edge was not useless
Give Grendel requital for the many assaults he
Had worked on the West-Danes not once, but often,
When he slew in slumber the subjects of Hrothgar,
Swallowed down fifteen sleeping retainers
Carried away, a horrible prey.
He gave him requital, grim-raging champion,
{Beowulf sees the body of Grendel, and cuts off his head.}
When he saw on his rest-place weary of conflict
Grendel lying, of life-joys bereaved,
His body far bounded, a blow when he suffered,
Death having seized him, sword-smiting heavy,
And he cut off his head then. Early this noticed
The clever carles who as comrades of Hrothgar
{The waters are gory.}
Were mightily mingled, the mere-flood was gory:
Of the good one the gray-haired together held converse,
{Beowulf is given up for dead.}
The hoary of head, that they hoped not to see again
The atheling ever, that exulting in victory
The ninth hour came then. From the ness-edge departed
The bold-mooded Scyldings; the gold-friend of heroes
Homeward betook him. The strangers sat down then
They wished and yet weened not their well-loved friend-lord
{The giant-sword melts.}
To see any more. The sword-blade began then,
The blood having touched it, contracting and shriveling
With battle-icicles; 'twas a wonderful marvel
The Father unbindeth the bond of the frost and
Unwindeth the wave-bands, He who wieldeth dominion
Of times and of tides: a truth-firm Creator.
Nor took he of jewels more in the dwelling,
Than the head and the handle handsome with jewels;
So hot was the blood, the strange-spirit poisonous
{The hero swims back to the realms of day.}
That in it did perish. He early swam off then
Went up through the ocean; the eddies were cleansed,
The spacious expanses, when the spirit from farland
His life put aside and this short-lived existence.
The seamen's defender came swimming to land then
The bulky burden which he bore in his keeping.
The excellent vassals advanced then to meet him,
To God they were grateful, were glad in their chieftain,
That to see him safe and sound was granted them.
Were speedily loosened: the ocean was putrid,
The water 'neath welkin weltered with gore.
Forth did they fare, then, their footsteps retracing,
Merry and mirthful, measured the earth-way,
Bare then the head from the sea-cliff, burdening
Each of the earlmen, excellent-valiant.
{It takes four men to carry Grendel's head on a spear.}
Four of them had to carry with labor
The head of Grendel to the high towering gold-hall
And battle-brave Geatmen came there going
Straight to the palace: the prince of the people
Measured the mead-ways, their mood-brave companion.
The atheling of earlmen entered the building,
Doughty shield-warrior, to address King Hrothgar:
Was borne to the building, where beer-thanes were drinking,

paper published some years ago in one of the Johns Hopkins University
circulars, I tried to throw upon these two long-doubtful passages some
light derived from a study of like passages in Alfred's prose.--The
impersonal verb 'geweorethan,' with an accus. of the person, and a
þaet-clause is used several times with the meaning 'agree.' See Orosius
(Sweet's ed.) 178_7; 204_34; 208_28; 210_15; 280_20. In the two
Beowulf passages, the þaet-clause is anticipated by 'þaes,' which is
clearly a gen. of the thing agreed on.
The first passage (v. 1599 (b)-1600) I translate literally: _Then many
agreed upon this (namely), that the sea-wolf had killed him_.
The second passage (v. 2025 (b)-2027): _She is promised ...; to this
the friend of the Scyldings has agreed, etc_. By emending 'is' instead
of 'waes' (2025), the tenses will be brought into perfect harmony.
In v. 1997 ff. this same idiom occurs, and was noticed in B.'s great
article on Beowulf, which appeared about the time I published my
reading of 1599 and 2027. Translate 1997 then: _Wouldst let the
South-Danes themselves decide about their struggle with Grendel_. Here
'Sueth-Dene' is accus. of person, and 'guethe' is gen. of thing agreed on.
With such collateral support as that afforded by B. (P. and B. XII.
The idiom above treated runs through A.-S., Old Saxon, and other
Teutonic languages, and should be noticed in the lexicons.
sword. Translate: _The damaskeened sword burned up_. Cf. 25_16 and
note.
To render this, "_nobly bold_," "_excellently bold_," have been
suggested. B. would read 'cyning-holde' (cf. 290), and render: _Men
well-disposed towards the king carried the head, etc._ 'Cynebealde,'
says t.B., endorsing Gr.
{Beowulf relates his last exploit.}
Beowulf spake, offspring of Ecgtheow:
"Lo! we blithely have brought thee, bairn of Healfdene,
Prince of the Scyldings, these presents from ocean
Which thine eye looketh on, for an emblem of glory.
In war 'neath the water the work with great pains I
Performed, and the fight had been finished quite nearly,
Had God not defended me. I failed in the battle
Aught to accomplish, aided by Hrunting,
{God was fighting with me.}
Gave me willingly to see on the wall a
Heavy old hand-sword hanging in splendor
(He guided most often the lorn and the friendless),
That I swung as a weapon. The wards of the house then
Then the battle-sword burned, the brand that was lifted,[1]
As the blood-current sprang, hottest of war-sweats;
Seizing the hilt, from my foes I offbore it;
I avenged as I ought to their acts of malignity,
{Heorot is freed from monsters.}
Thou'lt be able in Heorot careless to slumber
With thy throng of heroes and the thanes of thy people
Every and each, of greater and lesser,
And thou needest not fear for them from the selfsame direction
{The famous sword is presented to Hrothgar.}
The gray-haired chieftain, the gold-fashioned sword-hilt,
Old-work of giants, was thereupon given;
Since the fall of the fiends, it fell to the keeping
And the bad-mooded being abandoned this world then,
Opponent of God, victim of murder,
And also his mother; it went to the keeping
Of the best of the world-kings, where waters encircle,
{Hrothgar looks closely at the old sword.}
Hrothgar discoursed, the hilt he regarded,
The ancient heirloom where an old-time contention's
Beginning was graven: the gurgling currents,
The flood slew thereafter the race of the giants,
{It had belonged to a race hateful to God.}
The Lord everlasting, through lash of the billows
The Father gave them final requital.
So in letters of rune on the clasp of the handle
Gleaming and golden, 'twas graven exactly,
Finest of irons, who first it was wrought for,
Wreathed at its handle and gleaming with serpents.
The wise one then said (silent they all were)
{Hrothgar praises Beowulf.}
Son of old Healfdene: "He may say unrefuted
(The hoary old ruler remembers the past),
That better by birth is this bairn of the nobles!
Thy fame is extended through far-away countries,
Good friend Beowulf, o'er all of the races,
Prudence of spirit. I'll prove myself grateful
As before we agreed on; thou granted for long shalt
Become a great comfort to kinsmen and comrades,
{Heremod's career is again contrasted with Beowulf's.}
A help unto heroes. Heremod became not
He grew not to please them, but grievous destruction,
He slew in anger his table-companions,
Trustworthy counsellors, till he turned off lonely
Though high-ruling heaven in hero-strength raised him,
In might exalted him, o'er men of all nations
Made him supreme, yet a murderous spirit
Grew in his bosom: he gave then no ring-gems
{A wretched failure of a king, to give no jewels to his retainers.}
Standing the straits from strife that was raging,
Longsome folk-sorrow. Learn then from this,
Lay hold of virtue! Though laden with winters,
I have sung thee these measures. 'Tis a marvel to tell it,
{Hrothgar moralizes.}
Giveth wisdom to children of men,
Manor and earlship: all things He ruleth.
He often permitteth the mood-thought of man of
The illustrious lineage to lean to possessions,
A high-burg of heroes to hold in his keeping,
Maketh portions of earth-folk hear him,
And a wide-reaching kingdom so that, wisdom failing him,
He himself is unable to reckon its boundaries;
Nor sickness nor age, no treachery-sorrow
Becloudeth his spirit, conflict nowhere,
No sword-hate, appeareth, but all of the world doth
Wend as he wisheth; the worse he knoweth not,
Waxeth and springeth, when the warder is sleeping,
The guard of the soul: with sorrows encompassed,
Too sound is his slumber, the slayer is near him,
Who with bow and arrow aimeth in malice.
{A wounded spirit.}
"Then bruised in his bosom he with bitter-toothed missile
Is hurt 'neath his helmet: from harmful pollution
He is powerless to shield him by the wonderful mandates
Of the loath-cursed spirit; what too long he hath holden
Nor boastfully giveth gold-plated rings,[1]
The fate of the future flouts and forgetteth
Since God had erst given him greatness no little,
Wielder of Glory. His end-day anear,
Fleetingly fadeth, falls into ruins;
Another lays hold who doleth the ornaments,
The nobleman's jewels, nothing lamenting,
Heedeth no terror. Oh, Beowulf dear,
And choose thee the better, counsels eternal;
{Be not over proud: life is fleeting, and its strength soon wasteth away.}
Beware of arrogance, world-famous champion!
But a little-while lasts thy life-vigor's fulness;
'Twill after hap early, that illness or sword-edge
Or the wave of the current, or clutch of the edges,
Or flight of the war-spear, or age with its horrors,
Or thine eyes' bright flashing shall fade into darkness:
'Twill happen full early, excellent hero,
{Hrothgar gives an account of his reign.}
I held under heaven, helped them in struggles
'Gainst many a race in middle-earth's regions,
With ash-wood and edges, that enemies none
On earth molested me. Lo! offsetting change, now,
{Sorrow after joy.}
When Grendel became my constant visitor,
Inveterate hater: I from that malice
Continually travailed with trouble no little.
Thanks be to God that I gained in my lifetime,
Head with mine eyes, after long-lasting sorrow!
Go to the bench now, battle-adorned
Joy in the feasting: of jewels in common
We'll meet with many when morning appeareth."
To go to the bench, as the clever one bade him.
Then again as before were the famous-for-prowess,
Hall-inhabiters, handsomely banqueted,
Feasted anew. The night-veil fell then
The gray-haired was anxious to go to his slumbers,
The hoary old Scylding. Hankered the Geatman,
{Beowulf is fagged, and seeks rest.}
The champion doughty, greatly, to rest him:
An earlman early outward did lead him,
Who for etiquette's sake all of a liegeman's
Needs regarded, such as seamen at that time
Were bounden to feel. The big-hearted rested;
The building uptowered, spacious and gilded,
Blithely foreboded the beacon of heaven.
Then the bright-shining sun o'er the bottoms came going;[2]
The warriors hastened, the heads of the peoples
Were ready to go again to their peoples,
{The Geats prepare to leave Dane-land.}
Look for his vessel. The valiant one bade then,[3]
{Unferth asks Beowulf to accept his sword as a gift. Beowulf thanks him.}

To take his weapon, his well-beloved iron;
He him thanked for the gift, saying good he accounted

suggestions of Grdtvg. and M. be accepted, the passage will read:
_Then the brave one (_i.e._ Beowulf) commanded that Hrunting be borne
to the son of Ecglaf (Unferth), bade him take his sword, his dear
weapon; he (B.) thanked him (U.) for the loan, etc_.
{Beowulf's farewell.}
Beowulf spake, Ecgtheow's offspring:
"We men of the water wish to declare now
Fared from far-lands, we're firmly determined
To seek King Higelac. Here have we fitly
Good was the greeting. If greater affection
I am anywise able ever on earth to
Gain at thy hands, ruler of heroes,
Than yet I have done, I shall quickly be ready
{I shall be ever ready to aid thee.}
Learn I that neighbors alarm thee with terror,
As haters did whilom, I hither will bring thee
For help unto heroes henchmen by thousands.
{My liegelord will encourage me in aiding thee.}
I know as to Higelac, the lord of the Geatmen,
By words and by works, ward of the people,
Fully to furnish thee forces and bear thee
My lance to relieve thee, if liegemen shall fail thee,
And help of my hand-strength; if Hrethric be treating,
He thereat may find him friends in abundance:
Faraway countries he were better to seek for
Who trusts in himself." Hrothgar discoursed then,
Making rejoinder: "These words thou hast uttered
{O Beowulf, thou art wise beyond thy years.}
Ne'er heard I an earlman thus early in life
More clever in speaking: thou'rt cautious of spirit,
Mighty of muscle, in mouth-answers prudent.
I count on the hope that, happen it ever
Edge-horrid battle, and illness or weapon
Deprive thee of prince, of people's protector,
{Should Higelac die, the Geats could find no better successor than thou
wouldst make.}
And life thou yet holdest, the Sea-Geats will never
Find a more fitting folk-lord to choose them,
If the kingdom of kinsmen thou carest to govern.
Thy mood-spirit likes me the longer the better,
Beowulf dear: thou hast brought it to pass that
To both these peoples peace shall be common,
{Thou hast healed the ancient breach between our races.}
The secret assailings they suffered in yore-days;
And also that jewels be shared while I govern
The wide-stretching kingdom, and that many shall visit
Others o'er the ocean with excellent gift-gems:
Presents and love-gifts. This people I know
Tow'rd foeman and friend firmly established,[1]
After ancient etiquette everywise blameless."
Then the warden of earlmen gave him still farther,
{Parting gifts}
Bade him safely seek with the presents
His well-beloved people, early returning.
{Hrothgar kisses Beowulf, and weeps.}
Then the noble-born king kissed the distinguished,
Dear-loved liegeman, the Dane-prince saluted him,
From the gray-headed man: he two things expected,
Aged and reverend, but rather the second,
The man was so dear that he failed to suppress the
{The old king is deeply grieved to part with his benefactor.}
The long-famous hero longeth in secret
Deep in his spirit for the dear-beloved man
Though not a blood-kinsman. Beowulf thenceward,
Gold-splendid warrior, walked o'er the meadows
Riding at anchor awaited its owner.
As they pressed on their way then, the present of Hrothgar
{Giving liberally is the true proof of kingship.}
Was frequently referred to: a folk-king indeed that
Everyway blameless, till age did debar him
rendering: _I know this people with firm thought every way blameless
towards foe and friends_.
Hrothgar weep if he expects to meet Beowulf again?" both these
scholars ask. But the weeping is mentioned before the 'expectations':
the tears may have been due to many emotions, especially gratitude,
struggling for expression.
Then the band of very valiant retainers
Came to the current; they were clad all in armor,
{The coast-guard again.}
In link-woven burnies. The land-warder noticed
The return of the earlmen, as he erstwhile had seen them;
From the naze of the cliff, but rode on to meet them;
Said the bright-armored visitors[1] vesselward traveled
Lay on the sand, laden with armor,
The mast uptowered o'er the treasure of Hrothgar.
{Beowulf gives the guard a handsome sword.}
To the boat-ward a gold-bound brand he presented,
That he was afterwards honored on the ale-bench more highly
As the heirloom's owner. [2]Set he out on his vessel,
Along by the mast then a sea-garment fluttered,
A rope-fastened sail. The sea-boat resounded,
The wind o'er the waters the wave-floater nowise
Kept from its journey; the sea-goer traveled,
The well-fashioned vessel o'er the ways of the ocean,
{The Geats see their own land again.}
Till they came within sight of the cliffs of the Geatmen,
The well-known headlands. The wave-goer hastened
Driven by breezes, stood on the shore.
{The port-warden is anxiously looking for them.}
Who long in the past outlooked in the distance,[3]
At water's-edge waiting well-loved heroes;
He bound to the bank then the broad-bosomed vessel
Fast in its fetters, lest the force of the waters
Bade he up then take the treasure of princes,
Plate-gold and fretwork; not far was it thence
To go off in search of the giver of jewels:
The building was splendid, the king heroic,
Great in his hall, Hygd very young was,
{Hygd, the noble queen of Higelac, lavish of gifts.}
Fine-mooded, clever, though few were the winters
That the daughter of Haereth had dwelt in the borough;
Of ornaments rare, to the race of the Geatmen.
{Offa's consort, Thrytho, is contrasted with Hygd.}
Thrytho nursed anger, excellent[5] folk-queen,
Hot-burning hatred: no hero whatever
'Mong household companions, her husband excepted
{She is a terror to all save her husband.}
With eyes in the daytime;[6] but he knew that death-chains
Hand-wreathed were wrought him: early thereafter,
When the hand-strife was over, edges were ready,
That fierce-raging sword-point had to force a decision,
For a lady to practise, though lovely her person,
That a weaver-of-peace, on pretence of anger
A beloved liegeman of life should deprive.
Soothly this hindered Heming's kinsman;
That fearful folk-sorrows fewer she wrought them,
Treacherous doings, since first she was given
Adorned with gold to the war-hero youthful,
For her origin honored, when Offa's great palace
She sought on her journey, where she afterwards fully,
Famed for her virtue, her fate on the king's-seat
The ruler of heroes, the best, it is told me,
Of earl-kindreds endless; hence Offa was famous
Far and widely, by gifts and by battles,
Spear-valiant hero; the home of his fathers
He governed with wisdom, whence Eomaer did issue
Grandson of Garmund, great in encounters.

Then the brave one departed, his band along with him,
{Beowulf and his party seek Higelac.}
Seeking the sea-shore, the sea-marches treading,
The wide-stretching shores. The world-candle glimmered,
The sun from the southward; they proceeded then onward,
Ongentheow's slayer, excellent, youthful
Folk-prince and warrior was distributing jewels,
Close in his castle. The coming of Beowulf
Was announced in a message quickly to Higelac,
The linden-companion alive was advancing,
Secure from the combat courtward a-going.
The building was early inward made ready
For the foot-going guests as the good one had ordered.

Kinsman by kinsman, when the king of the people
Had in lordly language saluted the dear one,

In the high-towering palace. A curious interest

I mused upon torture, distrusted the journey
Of the beloved liegeman; I long time did pray thee
By no means to seek out the murderous spirit,
To suffer the South-Danes themselves to decide on[2]
To be suffered to see thee safe from thy journey."
{Beowulf narrates his adventures.}
Beowulf answered, bairn of old Ecgtheow:
"'Tis hidden by no means, Higelac chieftain,

That a noble-born Daneman the knights should be feasting:
Hard and ring-bright, Heathobards' treasure,
While they wielded their arms, till they misled to the battle
Their own dear lives and beloved companions.
He saith at the banquet who the collar beholdeth,
Clearly recalleth (cruel his spirit),
Sadly beginneth sounding the youthful
Thane-champion's spirit through the thoughts of his bosom,
War-grief to waken, and this word-answer speaketh:
{Ingeld is stirred up to break the truce.}
The brand which thy father bare to the conflict
In his latest adventure, 'neath visor of helmet,
The dearly-loved iron, where Danemen did slay him,
And brave-mooded Scyldings, on the fall of the heroes,
E'en now some man of the murderer's progeny
Exulting in ornaments enters the building,
Boasts of his blood-shedding, offbeareth the jewel
Which thou shouldst wholly hold in possession!'
With woe-bringing words, till waxeth the season
When the woman's thane for the works of his father,
The bill having bitten, blood-gory sleepeth,
Fated to perish; the other one thenceward
Then the oaths of the earlmen on each side are broken,
When rancors unresting are raging in Ingeld
And his wife-love waxeth less warm after sorrow.
So the Heathobards' favor not faithful I reckon,
Their friendship not fast. I further shall tell thee
{Having made these preliminary statements, I will now tell thee of
Grendel, the monster.}
More about Grendel, that thou fully mayst hear,
Ornament-giver, what afterward came from
The hand-rush of heroes. When heaven's bright jewel
The horrible night-fiend, us for to visit,
Where wholly unharmed the hall we were guarding.
{Hondscio fell first}
To Hondscio happened a hopeless contention,
Death to the doomed one, dead he fell foremost,
To the vassal distinguished, a tooth-weaponed murderer,
The well-beloved henchman's body all swallowed.
Not the earlier off empty of hand did
The bloody-toothed murderer, mindful of evils,
But sturdy of strength he strove to outdo me,
Hand-ready grappled. A glove was suspended
Spacious and wondrous, in art-fetters fastened,
Which was fashioned entirely by touch of the craftman
He down in its depths would do me unsadly
One among many, deed-doer raging,
Though sinless he saw me; not so could it happen
When I in my anger upright did stand.
For every evil to the earlmen's destroyer;
{I reflected honor upon my people.}
'Twas there, my prince, that I proudly distinguished
Thy land with my labors. He left and retreated,
He lived his life a little while longer:
And sad-mooded thence to the sea-bottom fell he,
Mournful in mind. For the might-rush of battle
{King Hrothgar lavished gifts upon me.}
The friend of the Scyldings, with gold that was plated,
With ornaments many, much requited me,
We had sat us together. There was chanting and joyance:
The age-stricken Scylding asked many questions
Joy-telling wood, were touched by the brave one;
Then the large-hearted land-king a legend of wonder
Truthfully told us. Now troubled with years
{The old king is sad over the loss of his youthful vigor.}
The age-hoary warrior afterward began to
Mourn for the might that marked him in youth-days;
Much he remembered. From morning till night then
We joyed us therein as etiquette suffered,
Till the second night season came unto earth-folk.
Then early thereafter, the mother of Grendel
{Grendel's mother.}
Her son had death ravished, the wrath of the Geatmen.
The horrible woman avenged her offspring,
And with mighty mainstrength murdered a hero.
{AEschere falls a prey to her vengeance.}
There the spirit of AEschere, aged adviser,
Were they anywise suffered to consume him with fire,
Folk of the Danemen, the death-weakened hero,
Nor the beloved liegeman to lay on the pyre;
{She suffered not his body to be burned, but ate it.}
She the corpse had offcarried in the clutch of the foeman[2]
Of pains that ever had preyed on the chieftain;
By the life of thee the land-prince then me[3]
Besought very sadly, in sea-currents' eddies
To display my prowess, to peril my safety,
{I sought the creature in her den,}
I found then the famous flood-current's cruel,
Horrible depth-warder. A while unto us two
With gore that was clotted, and Grendel's fierce mother's
{and hewed her head off.}
With huge-reaching sword-edge, hardly I wrested
My life from her clutches; not doomed was I then,

But the warden of earlmen afterward gave me
Jewels in quantity, kinsman of Healfdene.

then sadly besought me, with thy (presupposed) permission, etc_.
"So the beloved land-prince lived in decorum;
I had missed no rewards, no meeds of my prowess,
But he gave me jewels, regarding my wishes,
Healfdene his bairn; I'll bring them to thee, then,
{All my gifts I lay at thy feet.}
And still unto thee is all my affection:[1]
But few of my folk-kin find I surviving
But thee, dear Higelac!" Bade he in then to carry[2]
The boar-image, banner, battle-high helmet,
{This armor I have belonged of yore to Heregar.}
In song-measures said: "This suit-for-the-battle
Hrothgar presented me, bade me expressly,
Wise-mooded atheling, thereafter to tell thee[3]
The whole of its history, said King Heregar owned it,
Hereward the hardy. Hold all in joyance!"
I heard that there followed hard on the jewels
Two braces of stallions of striking resemblance,
Of horses and treasures. So a kinsman should bear him,
No web of treachery weave for another,
Nor by cunning craftiness cause the destruction
{Higelac loves his nephew Beowulf.}
Of trusty companion. Most precious to Higelac,
And each unto other mindful of favors.
{Beowulf gives Hygd the necklace that Wealhtheow had given him.}
I am told that to Hygd he proffered the necklace,
Wonder-gem rare that Wealhtheow gave him,
The troop-leader's daughter, a trio of horses
Embellish her bosom, when the beer-feast was over.
So Ecgtheow's bairn brave did prove him,
{Beowulf is famous.}
War-famous man, by deeds that were valiant,
He lived in honor, beloved companions
But by hand-strength hugest of heroes then living
The brave one retained the bountiful gift that
The Lord had allowed him. Long was he wretched,
So that sons of the Geatmen accounted him worthless,
Mickle of honor, when mead-cups were passing;
They fully believed him idle and sluggish,
{He is requited for the slights suffered in earlier days.}
An indolent atheling: to the honor-blest man there
Came requital for the cuts he had suffered.
The heirloom of Hrethel, embellished with gold,
{Higelac overwhelms the conqueror with gifts.}
So the brave one enjoined it; there was jewel no richer
In the form of a weapon 'mong Geats of that era;
In Beowulf's keeping he placed it and gave him
Common to both was land 'mong the people,
To the second one specially spacious dominions,
To the one who was better. It afterward happened
{After Heardred's death, Beowulf becomes king.}
After Higelac's death, and when Heardred was murdered
With weapons of warfare 'neath well-covered targets,
When valiant battlemen in victor-band sought him,
War-Scylfing heroes harassed the nephew
Turned there in time extensive dominions:
{He rules the Geats fifty years.}
He fittingly ruled them a fifty of winters
(He a man-ruler wise was, manor-ward old) till
A certain one 'gan, on gloom-darkening nights, a

A path 'neath it lay, unknown unto mortals.
Some one of earthmen entered the mountain,
The heathenish hoard laid hold of with ardor;

though liable to objection, is perhaps the best offered. 'That I
should very early tell thee of his favor, kindness' sounds well; but
'his' is badly placed to limit 'est.'--Perhaps, 'eft' with verbs of

{The hoard.}
Ancient ornaments in the earth-cave were lying,
As in days of yore some one of men of
Illustrious lineage, as a legacy monstrous,
There had secreted them, careful and thoughtful,
In the days of the past, and the one man moreover
Of the flower of the folk who fared there the longest,
Was fain to defer it, friend-mourning warder,
A little longer to be left in enjoyment
Stood on the plain the stream-currents nigh to,
New by the ness-edge, unnethe of approaching:
The keeper of rings carried within a
{The ring-giver bewails the loss of retainers.}
"Hold thou, O Earth, now heroes no more may,
The earnings of earlmen. Lo! erst in thy bosom
Worthy men won them; war-death hath ravished,
Perilous life-bale, all my warriors,
Who hall-pleasures saw. No sword-bearer have I,
And no one to burnish the gold-plated vessel,
The high-valued beaker: my heroes are vanished.
The hardy helmet behung with gilding
Who were charged to have ready visors-for-battle,
And the burnie that bided in battle-encounter
Moulds with the hero. The ring-twisted armor,
Hanging by heroes; harp-joy is vanished,
The rapture of glee-wood, no excellent falcon
Swoops through the building, no swift-footed charger
Grindeth the gravel. A grievous destruction
So, woful of spirit one after all
Lamented mournfully, moaning in sadness
By day and by night, till death with its billows
{The fire-dragon}
Dashed on his spirit. Then the ancient dusk-scather
He who flaming and fiery flies to the barrows,
Naked war-dragon, nightly escapeth
Encompassed with fire; men under heaven
Widely beheld him. 'Tis said that he looks for[4]
The heathenish treasure; he'll be nowise the better.
{The dragon meets his match.}
So three-hundred winters the waster of peoples
Held upon earth that excellent hoard-hall,
Till the forementioned earlman angered him bitterly:
And fullest remission for all his remissness
Begged of his liegelord. Then the hoard[5] was discovered,
The treasure was taken, his petition was granted
{The hero plunders the dragon's den}
The lorn-mooded liegeman. His lord regarded
When the dragon awoke, the strife was renewed there;
He snuffed 'long the stone then, stout-hearted found he
With cunning craftiness close to the head of
Anguish and exile with ease who possesseth
The favor of Heaven. The hoard-warden eagerly
Searched o'er the ground then, would meet with the person
That caused him sorrow while in slumber reclining:
All of it outward; not any of earthmen
Was seen in that desert.[6] Yet he joyed in the battle,
Rejoiced in the conflict: oft he turned to the barrow,
Sought for the gem-cup;[7] this he soon perceived then
{The dragon perceives that some one has disturbed his treasure.}
The famous folk-treasure. Not fain did the hoard-ward
Wait until evening; then the ward of the barrow
Was angry in spirit, the loathed one wished to
Pay for the dear-valued drink-cup with fire.
He no longer would wait on the wall, but departed

{The dragon spits fire.}
The stranger began then to vomit forth fire,
To burn the great manor; the blaze then glimmered
For anguish to earlmen, not anything living
The feud of the foeman afar and anear,
How the enemy injured the earls of the Geatmen,
Harried with hatred: back he hied to the treasure,
To the well-hidden cavern ere the coming of daylight.
With brand and burning; in the barrow he trusted,
In the wall and his war-might: the weening deceived him.
{Beowulf hears of the havoc wrought by the dragon.}
Then straight was the horror to Beowulf published,
Early forsooth, that his own native homestead,[1]
Gift-seat of Geatmen. 'Twas a grief to the spirit
Of the good-mooded hero, the greatest of sorrows:
{He fears that Heaven is punishing him for some crime.}
The wise one weened then that wielding his kingdom
'Gainst the ancient commandments, he had bitterly angered
His bosom welled inward, as was nowise his custom.
The fire-spewing dragon fully had wasted
The fastness of warriors, the water-land outward,
The manor with fire. The folk-ruling hero,
The warmen's defender bade them to make him,
Earlmen's atheling, an excellent war-shield
{He orders an iron shield to be made from him, wood is useless.}
Wholly of iron: fully he knew then
That wood from the forest was helpless to aid him,
Must live the last of his limited earth-days,
Of life in the world and the worm along with him,
Though he long had been holding hoard-wealth in plenty.
{He determines to fight alone.}
Then the ring-prince disdained to seek with a war-band,
He felt no fear of the foeman's assaults and
He counted for little the might of the dragon,
{Beowulf's early triumphs referred to}
A heap of hostility, hazarded dangers,
Conquering combatant, clutched in the battle
The kinsmen of Grendel, of kindred detested.[2]
{Higelac's death recalled.}
'Twas of hand-fights not least where Higelac was slaughtered,
When the king of the Geatmen with clashings of battle,
Offspring of Hrethrel perished through sword-drink,
With battle-swords beaten; thence Beowulf came then
On self-help relying, swam through the waters;
He bare on his arm, lone-going, thirty
The Hetwars by no means had need to be boastful
Of their fighting afoot, who forward to meet him
Carried their war-shields: not many returned from
The brave-mooded battle-knight back to their homesteads.
Lone-goer lorn to his land-folk returning,
Where Hygd to him tendered treasure and kingdom,
{Heardred's lack of capacity to rule.}
Rings and dominion: her son she not trusted,
To be able to keep the kingdom devised him
{Beowulf's tact and delicacy recalled.}
Yet the sad ones succeeded not in persuading the atheling
In any way ever, to act as a suzerain
To Heardred, or promise to govern the kingdom;
Yet with friendly counsel in the folk he sustained him,
{Reference is here made to a visit which Beowulf receives from Eanmund and
Eadgils, why they come is not known.}

Ohthere's sons, sought him o'er the waters:
They had stirred a revolt 'gainst the helm of the Scylfings,
The best of the sea-kings, who in Swedish dominions
By swing of the sword he received as a greeting,
Offspring of Higelac; Ongentheow's bairn

excellent emendation.

He planned requital for the folk-leader's ruin
In days thereafter, to Eadgils the wretched
Becoming an enemy. Ohthere's son then
Went with a war-troop o'er the wide-stretching currents
After avenged him, the king's life he took.
{Beowulf has been preserved through many perils.}
So he came off uninjured from all of his battles,
Perilous fights, offspring of Ecgtheow,
From his deeds of daring, till that day most momentous
{With eleven comrades, he seeks the dragon.}
With eleven companions the prince of the Geatmen
Went lowering with fury to look at the fire-drake:
Inquiring he'd found how the feud had arisen,
Hate to his heroes; the highly-famed gem-vessel
{A guide leads the way, but}
That in the throng was thirteenth of heroes,
That caused the beginning of conflict so bitter,
Captive and wretched, must sad-mooded thenceward
{very reluctantly.}
Point out the place: he passed then unwillingly
The cave under earth, not far from the ocean,
The anger of eddies, which inward was full of
Jewels and wires: a warden uncanny,
For any of earth-folk access to get to.
Then the battle-brave atheling sat on the naze-edge,
While the gold-friend of Geatmen gracious saluted
His fireside-companions: woe was his spirit,
Who must seize the old hero, his soul-treasure look for,
Dragging aloof his life from his body:
Not flesh-hidden long was the folk-leader's spirit.
Beowulf spake, Ecgtheow's son:
{Beowulf's retrospect.}
Hours of onset: that all I remember.
I was seven-winters old when the jewel-prince took me,
High-lord of heroes, at the hands of my father,
Hrethel the hero-king had me in keeping,
{Hrethel took me when I was seven.}
Not ever was I _any_ less dear to him
{He treated me as a son.}
Knight in the boroughs, than the bairns of his household,
Herebald and Haethcyn and Higelac mine.
To the eldest unjustly by acts of a kinsman
{One of the brothers accidentally kills another.}
His sheltering chieftain shot with an arrow,
Erred in his aim and injured his kinsman,
One brother the other, with blood-sprinkled spear:
{No fee could compound for such a calamity.}
'Twas a feeless fight, finished in malice,
Had to part from existence with vengeance untaken.
{[A parallel case is supposed.]}
So to hoar-headed hero 'tis heavily crushing[1]
Young on the gallows: then measures he chanteth,
For the raven's delight, and aged and hoary
He is unable to offer any assistance.
Every morning his offspring's departure
Is constant recalled: he cares not to wait for
Since that one through death-pain the deeds hath experienced.
He heart-grieved beholds in the house of his son the
Wine-building wasted, the wind-lodging places
Reaved of their roaring; the riders are sleeping,
Joy in the yards, as of yore were familiar.
Hrethel; but the translator here departs from his editor by
understanding the poet to refer to a hypothetical old man, introduced
as an illustration of a father's sorrow.
Hrethrel had certainly never seen a son of his ride on the gallows to
feed the crows.
The passage beginning 'swa bieth geomorlic' seems to be an effort to
reach a full simile, 'as ... so.' 'As it is mournful for an old man,
etc. ... so the defence of the Weders (2463) bore heart-sorrow, etc.'
The verses 2451 to 2463-1/2 would be parenthetical, the poet's feelings
being so strong as to interrupt the simile. The punctuation of the
fourth edition would be better--a comma after 'galgan' (2447). The
translation may be indicated as follows: _(Just) as it is sad for an
old man to see his son ride young on the gallows when he himself is
uttering mournful measures, a sorrowful song, while his son hangs for a
comfort to the raven, and he, old and infirm, cannot render him any
kelp--(he is constantly reminded, etc., 2451-2463)--so the defence of
the Weders, etc._
REMINISCENCES (_continued_).--BEOWULF'S LAST BATTLE.
"He seeks then his chamber, singeth a woe-song
One for the other; all too extensive
Seemed homesteads and plains. So the helm of the Weders
{Hrethel grieves for Herebald.}
Mindful of Herebald heart-sorrow carried,
To wreak his ruin on the ruthless destroyer:
He was unable to follow the warrior with hatred,
With deeds that were direful, though dear he not held him.
He left to his sons, as the man that is rich does,
His land and fortress, when from life he departed.
{Strife between Swedes and Geats.}
Then was crime and hostility 'twixt Swedes and Geatmen,
O'er wide-stretching water warring was mutual,
And Ongentheow's offspring were active and valiant,
Wished not to hold to peace oversea, but
Round Hreosna-beorh often accomplished
Cruelest massacre. This my kinsman avenged,
Though one of them paid it with forfeit of life-joys,
{Haethcyn's fall at Ravenswood.}
With price that was hard: the struggle became then
Fatal to Haethcyn, lord of the Geatmen.
Then I heard that at morning one brother the other
Where Ongentheow maketh onset on Eofor:
The helmet crashed, the hoary-haired Scylfing
Sword-smitten fell, his hand then remembered
Feud-hate sufficient, refused not the death-blow.
{I requited him for the jewels he gave me.}
'Quited in contest, as occasion was offered:
Land he allowed me, life-joy at homestead,
Manor to live on. Little he needed
From Gepids or Danes or in Sweden to look for
'Mong foot-soldiers ever in front I would hie me,
Alone in the vanguard, and evermore gladly
Warfare shall wage, while this weapon endureth
That late and early often did serve me
{Beowulf refers to his having slain Daeghrefn.}
Knight of the Hugmen: he by no means was suffered
To the king of the Frisians to carry the jewels,
The breast-decoration; but the banner-possessor
Bowed in the battle, brave-mooded atheling.
The surge of his spirit, his body destroying.
Now shall weapon's edge make war for the treasure,
And hand and firm-sword." Beowulf spake then,
Boast-words uttered--the latest occasion:
{He boasts of his youthful prowess, and declares himself still fearless.}
Still am I willing the struggle to look for,
Fame-deeds perform, folk-warden prudent,
If the hateful despoiler forth from his cavern
Seeketh me out!" Each of the heroes,
{His last salutations.}
Beloved co-liegemen--his last salutation:
"No brand would I bear, no blade for the dragon,
Wist I a way my word-boast to 'complish[1]
Else with the monster, as with Grendel I did it;
Furious flame-burning: so I fixed on my body
Target and war-mail. The ward of the barrow[2]
I'll not flee from a foot-length, the foeman uncanny.
At the wall 'twill befall us as Fate decreeth,

Bear his disaster, when the battle is over.
But me and me only, to measure his strength with
The monster of malice, might-deeds to 'complish.
I with prowess shall gain the gold, or the battle,
Brave under helmet, in battle-mail went he
'Neath steep-rising stone-cliffs, the strength he relied on
Of one man alone: no work for a coward.
Then he saw by the wall who a great many battles
{The place of strife is described.}
Stone-arches standing, stout-hearted champion,
Saw a brook from the barrow bubbling out thenceward:
The flood of the fountain was fuming with war-flame:
Not nigh to the hoard, for season the briefest
The drake was so fiery. The prince of the Weders
Caused then that words came from his bosom,
So fierce was his fury; the firm-hearted shouted:
His battle-clear voice came in resounding
{Beowulf calls out under the stone arches.}
The hoard-ward distinguished the speech of a man;
Time was no longer to look out for friendship.
The breath of the monster issued forth first,
Vapory war-sweat, out of the stone-cave:
{The terrible encounter.}
Lifted his shield, lord of the Geatmen,
Tow'rd the terrible stranger: the ring-twisted creature's
Heart was then ready to seek for a struggle.
{Beowulf brandishes his sword,}
The excellent battle-king first brandished his weapon,
To the death-planners twain was terror from other.
{and stands against his shield.}
The lord of the troopers intrepidly stood then
'Gainst his high-rising shield, when the dragon coiled him
{The dragon coils himself.}
Quickly together: in corslet he bided.
Hasting him forward. His life and body
The targe well protected, for time-period shorter
Than wish demanded for the well-renowned leader,
Where he then for the first day was forced to be victor,
The lord of the Geatmen uplifted his hand then,
Smiting the fire-drake with sword that was precious,
That bright on the bone the blade-edge did weaken,
Bit more feebly than his folk-leader needed,
{The dragon rages}
When the sword-blow had fallen, was fierce in his spirit,
Flinging his fires, flamings of battle
Gleamed then afar: the gold-friend of Weders
{Beowulf's sword fails him.}
Boasted no conquests, his battle-sword failed him
Long-trusty weapon. 'Twas no slight undertaking
That Ecgtheow's famous offspring would leave
The drake-cavern's bottom; he must live in some region
Other than this, by the will of the dragon,
'Twas early thereafter the excellent warriors
{The combat is renewed.}
Met with each other. Anew and afresh
The hoard-ward took heart (gasps heaved then his bosom):
{The great hero is reduced to extremities.}
Sorrow he suffered encircled with fire
Were banded about him, bairns of the princes,
{His comrades flee!}
With valorous spirit, but they sped to the forest,
Seeking for safety. The soul-deeps of one were

wall, as fate decrees, each one's Creator._
accepted by H.-So., in lieu of the long-standing 'ungleaw.' The former
is taken as an adj. limiting 'sweord'; the latter as an adj. c.
'gueth-cyning': _The good war-king, rash with edges, brandished his
sword, his old relic._ The latter gives a more rhetorical Anglo-Saxon
(poetical) sentence.
{Wiglaf remains true--the ideal Teutonic liegeman.}
The son of Weohstan was Wiglaf entitled,
Shield-warrior precious, prince of the Scylfings,
AElfhere's kinsman: he saw his dear liegelord
Enduring the heat 'neath helmet and visor.
{Wiglaf recalls Beowulf's generosity.}
The Waegmunding warriors' wealth-blessed homestead,
Each of the folk-rights his father had wielded;
He was hot for the battle, his hand seized the target,
The yellow-bark shield, he unsheathed his old weapon,
Ohthere's offspring, whom, exiled and friendless,
Weohstan did slay with sword-edge in battle,
And carried his kinsman the clear-shining helmet,
The ring-made burnie, the old giant-weapon
Ready war-trappings: he the feud did not mention,
Though he'd fatally smitten the son of his brother.
Many a half-year held he the treasures,
The bill and the burnie, till his bairn became able,
Then he gave him 'mong Geatmen a goodly array of
Weeds for his warfare; he went from life then
Old on his journey. 'Twas the earliest time then
{This is Wiglaf's first battle as liegeman of Beowulf.}
That the youthful champion might charge in the battle
Nor did kinsman's bequest quail at the battle:
This the dragon discovered on their coming together.
Wiglaf uttered many a right-saying,
Said to his fellows, sad was his spirit:
{Wiglaf appeals to the pride of the cowards.}
We promised in the hall the lord of us all
Swords and helmets, we'd certainly quite him,
Should need of such aid ever befall him:
{How we have forfeited our liegelord's confidence!}
Stirred us to glory and gave me these jewels,
Since he held and esteemed us trust-worthy spearmen,
Hardy helm-bearers, though this hero-achievement
Our lord intended alone to accomplish,
Doings audacious, he did among earth-folk.
{Our lord is in sore need of us.}
The day is now come when the ruler of earthmen
Needeth the vigor of valiant heroes:
Let us wend us towards him, the war-prince to succor,
{I would rather die than go home with out my suzerain.}
God wot in me, 'tis mickle the liefer
The blaze should embrace my body and eat it
With my treasure-bestower. Meseemeth not proper
To bear our battle-shields back to our country,
Long-hating foeman, to defend the life of

The prince of the Weders. Well do I know 'tisn't
Earned by his exploits, he only of Geatmen

Went under helmet to the help of his chieftain,

Briefly discoursing: "Beowulf dear,
Perform thou all fully, as thou formerly saidst,
Thy life thou shalt save, mighty in actions,
Atheling undaunted, with all of thy vigor;
{The monster advances on them.}
I'll give thee assistance." The dragon came raging,
('Twas the second occasion), seeking his enemies,
Men that were hated, with hot-gleaming fire-waves;
With blaze-billows burned the board to its edges:
The fight-armor failed then to furnish assistance
Quickly advanced 'neath his kinsman's war-target,
Since his own had been ground in the grip of the fire.
{Beowulf strikes at the dragon.}
Then the warrior-king was careful of glory,
He soundly smote with sword-for-the-battle,
Naegling was shivered, the old and iron-made
{His sword fails him.}
Brand of Beowulf in battle deceived him.
'Twas denied him that edges of irons were able
To help in the battle; the hand was too mighty
Outstruck in its stroke, when to struggle he carried
The wonderful war-sword: it waxed him no better.
{The dragon advances on Beowulf again.}
Then the people-despoiler--third of his onsets--
Fierce-raging fire-drake, of feud-hate was mindful,
Heated and war-grim, seized on his neck
With teeth that were bitter; he bloody did wax with
Soul-gore seething; sword-blood in waves boiled.

Then I heard that at need of the king of the people
The upstanding earlman exhibited prowess,
Vigor and courage, as suited his nature;
So he struck the strife-bringing strange-comer lower,

Gleaming and plated, that 'gan then the fire[2]

A thaneman when needed. To the prince 'twas the last of
His era of conquest by his own great achievements,
{Beowulf's wound swells and burns.}
The latest of world-deeds. The wound then began
Which the earth-dwelling dragon erstwhile had wrought him
That bitterest bale-woe in his bosom was raging,
Poison within. The atheling advanced then,
{He sits down exhausted.}
That along by the wall, he prudent of spirit
Might sit on a settle; he saw the giant-work,
The earth-hall eternal inward supported.
Then the long-worthy liegeman laved with his hand the

passage of a plethora of conjunctive _þaet_'s.

had destroyed him, chieftains related_. This gives Beowulf the credit
of having felled the dragon; then they combine to annihilate him.--For
'ellen' (2707), Kl. suggests 'e(a)llne.'--The reading '_life drove out
strength_' is very unsatisfactory and very peculiar. I would suggest
as follows: Adopt S.'s emendation, remove H.'s parenthesis, read
'ferh-ellen wraec,' and translate: _He felled the foe, drove out his
life-strength_ (that is, made him _hors de combat_), _and then they
both, etc_.
{Wiglaf fulfils his lord's behest.}
Then heard I that Wihstan's son very quickly,
These words being uttered, heeded his liegelord
Wounded and war-sick, went in his armor,
His well-woven ring-mail, 'neath the roof of the barrow.
{The dragon's den.}
Victorious saw, when the seat he came near to,
Gold-treasure sparkling spread on the bottom,
Wonder on the wall, and the worm-creature's cavern,
The ancient dawn-flier's, vessels a-standing,
Robbed of their ornaments: there were helmets in numbers,
Old and rust-eaten, arm-bracelets many,
Artfully woven. Wealth can easily,
Gold on the sea-bottom, turn into vanity[1]
And he saw there lying an all-golden banner
High o'er the hoard, of hand-wonders greatest,
Linked with lacets: a light from it sparkled,
That the floor of the cavern he was able to look on,
{The dragon is not there.}
{Wiglaf bears the hoard away.}
Then I heard that the hero the hoard-treasure plundered,
The giant-work ancient reaved in the cavern,
Bare on his bosom the beakers and platters,
The brightest of beacons;[2] the bill had erst injured
(Its edge was of iron), the old-ruler's weapon,
Him who long had watched as ward of the jewels,
Who fire-terror carried hot for the treasure,
Till murdered he perished. The messenger hastened,
Not loth to return, hurried by jewels:
Curiosity urged him if, excellent-mooded,
Alive he should find the lord of the Weders
'Mid the jewels he found then the famous old chieftain,
His liegelord beloved, at his life's-end gory:
He thereupon 'gan to lave him with water,
Till the point of his word pierced his breast-hoard.
{Beowulf is rejoiced to see the jewels.}
The old one in sorrow: "For the jewels I look on
Thanks do I utter for all to the Ruler,
Wielder of Worship, with words of devotion,
The Lord everlasting, that He let me such treasures
Since I've bartered the aged life to me granted
For treasure of jewels, attend ye henceforward
{He desires to be held in memory by his people.}
The wants of the war-thanes; I can wait here no longer.
The battle-famed bid ye to build them a grave-hill,
As a memory-mark to the men I have governed,
That earls of the ocean hereafter may call it
Beowulf's barrow, those who barks ever-dashing
{The hero's last gift}
The bold-mooded troop-lord took from his neck then
The ring that was golden, gave to his liegeman,
The youthful war-hero, his gold-flashing helmet,
His collar and war-mail, bade him well to enjoy them:
{and last words.}
Of Waegmunding people: Weird hath offcarried
All of my kinsmen to the Creator's glory,
Earls in their vigor: I shall after them fare."
'Twas the aged liegelord's last-spoken word in
The battle-waves burning: from his bosom departed
His soul to seek the sainted ones' glory.
two quite distinct translations of this passage have arisen. One takes
'oferhigian' as meaning 'to exceed,' and, inserting 'hord' after
'gehwone,' renders: _The treasure may easily, the gold in the ground,
exceed in value every hoard of man, hide it who will._ The other takes
'oferhigian' as meaning 'to render arrogant,' and, giving the sentence
a moralizing tone, renders substantially as in the body of this work.

of the ancient possessor of the hoard. 'AEr gescod' (2778), translated
in this work as verb and adverb, is by some regarded as a compound
participial adj. = _sheathed in brass_.
{Wiglaf is sorely grieved to see his lord look so un-warlike.}
It had wofully chanced then the youthful retainer
To behold on earth the most ardent-beloved
At his life-days' limit, lying there helpless.
The slayer too lay there, of life all bereaved,
{The dragon has plundered his last hoard.}
The round-twisted monster was permitted no longer
To govern the ring-hoards, but edges of war-swords
Mightily seized him, battle-sharp, sturdy
Leavings of hammers, that still from his wounds
Hard by his hoard-house, hopped he at midnight
Not e'er through the air, nor exulting in jewels
Suffered them to see him: but he sank then to earthward
Through the hero-chief's handwork. I heard sure it throve then
{Few warriors dared to face the monster.}
Though of every achievement bold he had proved him,
To run 'gainst the breath of the venomous scather,
Or the hall of the treasure to trouble with hand-blows,
If he watching had found the ward of the hoard-hall
The treasure of jewels was paid for with death;
Each of the twain had attained to the end of
Life so unlasting. Not long was the time till
{The cowardly thanes come out of the thicket.}
The tardy-at-battle returned from the thicket,
Who durst not before play with the lances
In the prince of the people's pressing emergency;
{They are ashamed of their desertion.}
But blushing with shame, with shields they betook them,
With arms and armor where the old one was lying:
Foot-going fighter, not far from the shoulders
Of the lord of the people, would rouse him with water;
No whit did it help him; though he hoped for it keenly,
He was able on earth not at all in the leader
The will of the Wielder; the World-Ruler's power[1]
Would govern the actions of each one of heroes,
{Wiglaf is ready to excoriate them.}
As yet He is doing. From the young one forthwith then
Could grim-worded greeting be got for him quickly
Weohstan his son, sad-mooded hero,
{He begins to taunt them.}
Looked on the hated: "He who soothness will utter
Can say that the liegelord who gave you the jewels,
The ornament-armor wherein ye are standing,
Helmet and burnie, the prince to his liegemen,
As best upon earth he was able to find him,--
{Surely our lord wasted his armor on poltroons.}
That he wildly wasted his war-gear undoubtedly
When battle o'ertook him.[2] The troop-king no need had
{He, however, got along without you}
Victory-Wielder, with weapon unaided
Himself to avenge, when vigor was needed.
I life-protection but little was able
To give him in battle, and I 'gan, notwithstanding,
{With some aid, I could have saved our liegelord}
He waxed the weaker when with weapon I smote on
My mortal opponent, the fire less strongly
Flamed from his bosom. Too few of protectors
Came round the king at the critical moment.
{Gift-giving is over with your people: the ring-lord is dead.}
Home-joyance all, cease for your kindred,
Food for the people; each of your warriors
Must needs be bereaved of rights that he holdeth
In landed possessions, when faraway nobles

The dastardly deed. Death is more pleasant
To every earlman than infamous life is!"
_The might (or judgment) of God would determine death for every man,
as he still does._
'When ... him' (A.-S. 'þa ... beget') with the following sentence;
that is, they make it dependent upon 'þorfte' (2875) instead of upon
'forwurpe' (2873).
{Wiglaf sends the news of Beowulf's death to liegemen near by.}
Then he charged that the battle be announced at the hedge
Up o'er the cliff-edge, where the earl-troopers bided
The whole of the morning, mood-wretched sat them,
Bearers of battle-shields, both things expecting,
The liegelord beloved. Little reserved he
Of news that was known, who the ness-cliff did travel,
But he truly discoursed to all that could hear him:
{The messenger speaks.}
"Now the free-giving friend-lord of the folk of the Weders,
By the deeds of the dragon in death-bed abideth;
Along with him lieth his life-taking foeman
Slain with knife-wounds: he was wholly unable
To injure at all the ill-planning monster
{Wiglaf sits by our dead lord.}
Offspring of Wihstan, up over Beowulf,
Earl o'er another whose end-day hath reached him,
Head-watch holdeth o'er heroes unliving,[1]
{Our lord's death will lead to attacks from our old foes.}
For friend and for foeman. The folk now expecteth
To Frankmen and Frisians in far-lands is published.
The war-hatred waxed warm 'gainst the Hugmen,
{Higelac's death recalled.}
When Higelac came with an army of vessels
Faring to Friesland, where the Frankmen in battle
That the mail-clad warrior must sink in the battle,
Fell 'mid his folk-troop: no fret-gems presented
The atheling to earlmen; aye was denied us
Merewing's mercy. The men of the Swedelands
But widely 'twas known that near Ravenswood Ongentheow
{Haethcyn's fall referred to.}
Sundered Haethcyn the Hrethling from life-joys,
When for pride overweening the War-Scylfings first did
Seek the Geatmen with savage intentions.
Old and terrible, give blow in requital,
Killing the sea-king, the queen-mother rescued,
The old one his consort deprived of her gold,
Onela's mother and Ohthere's also,
Reaved of their ruler, they Ravenswood entered.
Then with vast-numbered forces he assaulted the remnant,
Weary with wounds, woe often promised
The livelong night to the sad-hearted war-troop:
Some on the gallows for glee to the fowls.
Aid came after to the anxious-in-spirit
At dawn of the day, after Higelac's bugle
And trumpet-sound heard they, when the good one proceeded

mood-weary, holds head-watch o'er friend and foe_.--B. suggests taking
the word as dat. inst. plu. of an abstract noun in -'u.' The
translation would be substantially the same as S.'s.
{The messenger continues, and refers to the feuds of Swedes and Geats.}
"The blood-stained trace of Swedes and Geatmen,
The death-rush of warmen, widely was noticed,
How the folks with each other feud did awaken.
The worthy one went then[1] with well-beloved comrades,
Ongentheo earl upward then turned him;
Of Higelac's battle he'd heard on inquiry,
The exultant one's prowess, despaired of resistance,
With earls of the ocean to be able to struggle,
His wife and his children; he fled after thenceward
Old 'neath the earth-wall. Then was offered pursuance
To the braves of the Swedemen, the banner[2] to Higelac.
Then with edges of irons was Ongentheow driven,
The gray-haired to tarry, that the troop-ruler had to
Suffer the power solely of Eofor:
{Wulf wounds Ongentheow.}
Wulf then wildly with weapon assaulted him,
The blood from his body burst out in currents,
Forth 'neath his hair. He feared not however,
Gray-headed Scylfing, but speedily quited
{Ongentheow gives a stout blow in return.}
The wasting wound-stroke with worse exchange,
The wise-mooded son of Wonred was powerless
To give a return-blow to the age-hoary man,
But his head-shielding helmet first hewed he to pieces,
That flecked with gore perforce he did totter,
But up did he spring though an edge-wound had reached him.
{Eofor smites Ongentheow fiercely.}
Then Higelac's vassal, valiant and dauntless,
When his brother lay dead, made his broad-bladed weapon,
Giant-sword ancient, defence of the giants,
{Ongentheow is slain.}
Shepherd of people, was pierced to the vitals.
There were many attendants who bound up his kinsman,
Carried him quickly when occasion was granted
That the place of the slain they were suffered to manage.
His armor of iron from Ongentheow ravished,
His hard-sword hilted and helmet together;
{Eofor takes the old king's war-gear to Higelac.}
The old one's equipments he carried to Higelac.
He the jewels received, and rewards 'mid the troopers
The king of the Weders requited the war-rush,
Hrethel's descendant, when home he repaired him,
{Higelac rewards the brothers.}
To Eofor and Wulf with wide-lavished treasures,
To each of them granted a hundred of thousands
{His gifts were beyond cavil.}
None upon mid-earth needed to twit him[3]
With the gifts he gave them, when glory they conquered;
{To Eofor he also gives his only daughter in marriage.}
And to Eofor then gave he his one only daughter,
The honor of home, as an earnest of favor.
The anger of earthmen, that earls of the Swedemen
Will visit on us, when they hear that our leader
Lifeless is lying, he who longtime protected
His hoard and kingdom 'gainst hating assailers,
The deed-mighty Scyldings,[4] did for the troopers
What best did avail them, and further moreover
{It is time for us to pay the last marks of respect to our lord.}
Hero-deeds 'complished. Now is haste most fitting,
That the lord of liegemen we look upon yonder,
Who ring-presents gave us. Not aught of it all
Shall melt with the brave one--there's a mass of bright jewels,
Gold beyond measure, grewsomely purchased
And ending it all ornament-rings too
Flame shall cover, no earlman shall wear
A jewel-memento, nor beautiful virgin
Have on her neck rings to adorn her,
But wretched in spirit bereaved of gold-gems
Since the leader of liegemen hath laughter forsaken,
Cold from the morning shall be clutched in the fingers,
Heaved in the hand, no harp-music's sound shall
Fain over fey ones freely shall gabble,
Shall say to the eagle how he sped in the eating,
When, the wolf his companion, he plundered the slain."
So the high-minded hero was rehearsing these stories
{The warriors go sadly to look at Beowulf's lifeless body.}
Weirds and of words. All the war-troop arose then,
'Neath the Eagle's Cape sadly betook them,
Weeping and woful, the wonder to look at.
They saw on the sand then soulless a-lying,
In days that were done; then the death-bringing moment
Was come to the good one, that the king very warlike,
Wielder of Weders, with wonder-death perished.
First they beheld there a creature more wondrous,
{They also see the dragon.}
The foeman before them: the fire-spewing dragon,
Ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors,
Was scorched in the fire; as he lay there he measured
Fifty of feet; came forth in the night-time[5]
To visit his den; he in death was then fastened,
He would joy in no other earth-hollowed caverns.
There stood round about him beakers and vessels,
Dishes were lying and dear-valued weapons,
A thousand of winters there they had rested:
{The hoard was under a magic spell.}
That mighty bequest then with magic was guarded,
Gold of the ancients, that earlman not any
The ring-hall could touch, save Ruling-God only,
{God alone could give access to it.}
E'en to such among mortals as seemed to Him proper.

then stand: '_The old one went then,' etc._

authorities construe 'him' (2996) as plu., and understand the passage

given rise to several theories, the most important of which are as
follows: (1) After the downfall of Hrothgar's family, Beowulf was king
of the Danes, or Scyldings. (2) For 'Scyldingas' read
'Scylfingas'--that is, after killing Eadgils, the Scylfing prince,
Beowulf conquered his land, and held it in subjection. (3) M.
considers 3006 a thoughtless repetition of 2053. (Cf. H.-So.)
and renders: _Joy in the air had he of yore by night, etc_. He thinks
that the idea of vanished time ought to be expressed.
_God_) _is the hope of men_); (2) (_he is the hope of heroes_). Gr.'s
reading has no parenthesis, but says: ... _could touch, unless God
himself, true king of victories, gave to whom he would to open the
treasure, the secret place of enchanters, etc_. The last is rejected
on many grounds.
Then 'twas seen that the journey prospered him little
Who wrongly within had the ornaments hidden[1]
Down 'neath the wall. The warden erst slaughtered
Some few of the folk-troop: the feud then thereafter
When the strength-famous trooper has attained to the end of
Life-days allotted, then no longer the man may
Remain with his kinsmen where mead-cups are flowing.
So to Beowulf happened when the ward of the barrow,
How his leaving this life was likely to happen.
So to doomsday, famous folk-leaders down did
Call it with curses--who 'complished it there--
Punished with plagues, who this place should e'er ravage.[3]
He cared not for gold: rather the Wielder's
Favor preferred he first to get sight of.[4]
{Wiglaf addresses his comrades.}
Wiglaf discoursed then, Wihstan his son:
Sorrow endure, as to us it hath happened.
The liegelord beloved we could little prevail on,
Kingdom's keeper, counsel to follow,
Not to go to the guardian of the gold-hoard, but let him
Till the end of the world. Met we a destiny
Hard to endure: the hoard has been looked at,
Been gained very grimly; too grievous the fate that[5]
The prince of the people pricked to come thither.

Not kindly at all entrance permitted
{He tells them of Beowulf's last moments.}
Within under earth-wall. Hastily seized I
And held in my hands a huge-weighing burden
To my liegelord beloved: life was yet in him,

Much and mournfully, commanded to greet you,

Fully be fashioned, when forth we shall come,
And lift we our lord, then, where long he shall tarry,

The best of the braves from the band of the ruler

Seven together; 'neath the enemy's roof he
Went with the seven; one of the heroes
Bare in his hand. No lot then decided

appointed time had come.--B. sees a corruption, and makes emendations
introducing the idea that a brave man should not die from sickness or
from old age, but should find death in the performance of some deed of
daring.--S. sees an indirect question introduced by 'hwar' and

Behung with helmets, hero-knights' targets,
And bright-shining burnies, as he begged they should have them;

Soldiers began then to make on the barrow

{The Weders carry out their lord's last request.}
The men of the Weders made accordingly
A hill on the height, high and extensive,
Of sea-going sailors to be seen from a distance,
And the brave one's beacon built where the fire was,
As wisest of world-folk could most worthily plan it.
They placed in the barrow rings and jewels,
{Rings and gems are laid in the barrow.}
All such ornaments as erst in the treasure
War-mooded men had won in possession:
The gold to the dust, where yet it remaineth

American editors of Beowulf, in their last edition, 1888. The rest will, I
hope, be noticed in their fourth edition. As, however, this book may fall
into the hands of some who have no copy of the American edition, it seems
best to notice all the principal oversights of the German editors.
~From ham~ (194).--Notes and glossary conflict; the latter not having been
altered to suit the conclusions accepted in the former.
~Þaer gelyfan sceal dryhtnes dome~ (440).--Under 'dom' H. says 'the might
of the Lord'; while under 'gelyfan' he says 'the judgment of the Lord.'
~Eal bencþelu~ (486).--Under 'benc-þelu' H. says _nom. plu._; while under
'eal' he says _nom. sing._
~Heatho-raemas~ (519).--Under 'aetberan' H. translates 'to the Heathoremes';
while under 'Heatho-raemas' he says 'Heathoraemas reaches Breca in the
swimming-match with Beowulf.' Harrison and Sharp (3d edition, 1888) avoid
the discrepancy.
~Fah feond-scaetha~ (554).--Under 'feond-scaetha' H. says 'a gleaming
sea-monster'; under 'fah' he says 'hostile.'
~Onfeng hraethe inwit-þancum~ (749).--Under 'onfon' H. says 'he _received_
the maliciously-disposed one'; under 'inwit-þanc' he says 'he _grasped_,'
etc.
~Nieth-wundor seon~ (1366).--Under 'nieth-wundor' H. calls this word itself
_nom. sing._; under 'seon' he translates it as accus. sing., understanding
'man' as subject of 'seon.' H. and S. (3d edition) make the correction.
~Forgeaf hilde-bille~ (1521).--H., under the second word, calls it instr.
dat.; while under 'forgifan' he makes it the dat. of indir. obj. H. and S.
(3d edition) make the change.
~Brad~ and ~brun-ecg~ (1547).--Under 'brad' H. says 'das breite Hueftmesser
mit bronzener Klinge'; under 'brun-ecg' he says 'ihr breites Hueftmesser
mit blitzender Klinge.'
~Yethelice~ (1557).--Under this word H. makes it modify 'astod.' If this be
right, the punctuation of the fifth edition is wrong. See H. and S.,
appendix.
~Selran gesohte~ (1840).--Under 'sel' and 'gesecan' H. calls these two
words accus. plu.; but this is clearly an error, as both are nom. plu.,
pred. nom. H. and S. correct under 'sel.'
~Wieth sylfne~ (1978).--Under 'wieth' and 'gesittan' H. says 'wieth = near, by';
under 'self' he says 'opposite.'
~þeow~ (2225) is omitted from the glossary.
~For duguethum~ (2502).--Under 'dugueth' H. translates this phrase, 'in
Tuechtigkeit'; under 'for,' by 'vor der edlen Kriegerschaar.'
~þaer~ (2574).--Under 'wealdan' H. translates _þaer_ by 'wo'; under 'motan,'
by 'da.' H. and S. suggest 'if' in both passages.
~Wunde~ (2726).--Under 'wund' H. says 'dative,' and under 'wael-bleate' he
says 'accus.' It is without doubt accus., parallel with 'benne.'
~Strengum gebaeded~ (3118).--Under 'strengo' H. says 'Strengum' = mit
Macht; under 'gebaeded' he translates 'von den Sehnen.' H. and S. correct
this discrepancy by rejecting the second reading.
~Bronda be lafe~ (3162).--A recent emendation. The fourth edition had
'bronda betost.' In the fifth edition the editor neglects to change the
glossary to suit the new emendation. See 'bewyrcan.'
