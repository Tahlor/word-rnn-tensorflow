INTRODUCTION


I.

_One Epistle To Mr. Pope_, complained Pope to Bethel, â€œcontains as many
Lyes as Lines.â€ But just for that reason it is not, as Pope also says in
the same letter, â€œbelow all notice.â€[1] _The Blatant Beast_, published
twelve years later, is another attack on Pope almost as compendious and
quite as virulent. They are here presented to the modern student of Pope
as good examples of their kind. The importance of the pamphlet attacks
on Pope for a full understanding of his satiric art is universally
admitted, but the pamphlets themselves were cheap and ephemeral,
and copies are now rare and not easily come by. Both in the
comprehensiveness of their charges and in the slashing hatred which
informs them (however feeble the verse), _One Epistle_ and _The Blatant
Beast_ offer as fair a sample as any two such pamphlets can of the
calumny, detraction, and critical misunderstanding Pope endured, for the
most part patiently, from the publication of his _Essay on Criticism_ to
the year of his death. â€œWelcome for thee, fair Virtue! all the past,â€
(_Epistle to Arbuthnot_, l.Â 358) he exclaimed in his role as Satirist.

It was this public proclamation of Virtue that confused and enraged the
Dunces. We have again learned to read satire as something quite other
than an expression of personal malice and misanthropy. What the present
pamphlets amply testify to is that most of the Dunces were no more able
to read satire properly than were Popeâ€™s nineteenth-century critics.
They were, as Pope quite properly kept pointing out, very bad writers
and very dull men. The _ethos_ of the satiric _persona_ was something
they could not understand. Although some of the Dunces knew their
classics well and although all of them, we may presume, read the Roman
satirists, one did not, typically, in Grub Street consult oneâ€™s Horace
with diurnal hand; one consulted the public. Literature to them was
sold. They were not deeply concerned about absolute standards of
right and wrong, about works of imagination which justify an entire
civilization, about the problem of tradition and the individual talent.
Accordingly, they explained satire, with the only vocabulary they had,
as the expression of ingratitude, purely personal malice, and demonic
pride, the product of a diseased heart and a misshapen body.

It would be misleading to suggest a narrow definition of Popeâ€™s Dunces.
Some were critics of worth, such as Dennis and Gildon; some were not
despicable minor poets, such as Welsted and Cooke. But if we leave these
aside, as well as his aristocratic enemies, Lady Mary and Lord Hervey,
some valid generalizations emerge. The very persistency of the Duncesâ€™
attacks on Pope (IÂ have located over one hundred and fifty published
during Popeâ€™s lifetime) and the large number of anonymous pamphlets that
we cannot definitely ascribe to anyone Pope ever mentioned suggest that
the Battle of the Dunces is best seen economically and sociologically.
They were, for the most part, hack-writers, who were attempting the
commercialization of literature that Pope recognized and deplored.
Since they were authors to be let, they were neither fastidious about
standards of taste nor filled with reverence for the Word. Yet Pope
had succeeded in doing what they could not do--he had made himself a
moderately rich man entirely by writing poetry. No theme recurs more
insistently and suggestively in Popiana than Popeâ€™s wealth. Faced with
the nasty fact that if one wrote well enough, there was a public to
support one, they could only accuse Pope monotonously of venality and
avarice.

In all of this there is a strong element of class antagonism. The Dunces
were middle-class and Whiggish, their spirit capitalist. Pope, though
middle-class by birth, was aristocratic in his sympathies, Tory in
a loose sense, and firmly anti-Walpole. Perhaps verse satire is
essentially aristocratic. Perhaps wit is, too. Certainly they never seem
at home in a middle-class society. Wit comes to savor of indecency and
blasphemy; satire in its incessant defence of moral value and centers
of order comes to seem the expression of an arrogant disdain and a
disquieting unease. His poise and verbal brilliance and hieratic
commitment to the venerable tradition of classical and Christian ethical
thought set the Satirist coolly apart from the _profanum vulgus_. Had
Pope never mentioned one of the Dunces, although they would have done
so less frequently, they would still have cried out against him.


II.

_One Epistle To Mr. A. Pope, Occasionâ€™d By Two Epistles Lately
Published_ appeared, according to the _Daily Journal_, on 28 April
1730.[2] Popeâ€™s mention of it in Appendix II to _The Dunciad A_, his
â€œList of Books, Papers, and Verses, in which our Author was abusedâ€
which is our best guide to Popiana, is somewhat confusing and made more
difficult because the first part dates from 1729, the second from 1735:
â€œ_Labeo_, AÂ Paper of Verses written by Leonard Welsted. [1729 a-d],
which after came into One Epistle, and was publishâ€™d by James Moore.
4to. 1730. Another part of it came out in Welstedâ€™s own name in 1731,
under the just Title of _Dulness and Scandal_, fol. [1735a].â€[3]

The _Labeo_ reference is mysterious. Pope in his note on Welsted to _The
Dunciad A_ II.293 had said in a sentence omitted in all editions from
1735a, â€œThe strength of the metaphors in this passage is to express the
great scurrility and fury of this writer, which may be seen, One day, in
a Piece of his, callâ€™d (as I think) _Labeo_.â€[4] Since no _Labeo_ has
ever turned up, it seems reasonable to conclude with Fineman that,
though Welsted may have toyed with the idea of writing one, â€œhe either
never did enough with it to warrant its publication, or discarded it
entirely in favor of writing the collaborative _One Epistle to Mr. Pope_
that appeared in 1730. Naturally, he would not broadcast his plans, and
as a result the enemy camp continued to believe--or at any rate, to
say--that Welsted would retaliate with a _Labeo_.â€[5] This was in 1729;
by 1735 Pope had realized no _Labeo_ would appear and deciding,
apparently on no evidence, that it had been incorporated into Welstedâ€™s
_One Epistle_ and _Of Dulness and Scandal_ (1732), made the appropriate
changes in _The Dunciad_.

Pope did not at first realize that _One Epistle_ was by Welsted. It
had been announced as early as 1Â Feb. 1729 in _The Universal Spectator_
â€œas the due Chastisement of Mr. Pope for his _Dunciad_, by James Moore
Smythe, Esq; and Mr. Welsted.â€ The poem must have been circulated
privately before publication at least by October, 1729 at which time
Pope believed it to be Lady Maryâ€™s, since we find Lady Mary writing to
Dr. Arbuthnot twice in October 1729 denying Popeâ€™s accusation that she
had written it.[6] There is no evidence that she was not telling the
truth, but on 21 May 1730 _The Grub-Street Journal_ reported that Lady
Mary had â€œsome hand in the piece.â€

Like most Pope attacks, the poem was published anonymously. The preface,
aÂ defence of the Dunces, is, with probably intentional ambiguity,
written in the first person singular but ends by referring to â€œthe
Writers of the following Poemâ€ (p.Â viii). One hand seems responsible for
the preface, but we can only conclude that a Dunce collaborating with
other Dunces produced the poem. Four days after its publication Pope
wrote to Broome that it was â€œby James Moore and others,â€ and a few weeks
later wrote to Bethel that â€œJames Moore ownâ€™d it but was made by three
others, and he will disown it whenever any man takes him for it.â€[7] It
was Moore Smythe who was attacked in _The Grub-Street Journal_ for
several months as the poemâ€™s chief author.[8]

A letter from Welsted to Dodington, however, shows that though the poem
was a collaborative effort and though others may have made suggestions
and additions, Welsted felt himself responsible for the poem.[9] In 1735
Pope attributed _One Epistle_ finally to Welsted, with Moore Smythe as
publisher, and in 1737 _The Memoirs of Grub-Street_ said of Moore Smythe
that he â€œreported himself authorâ€ of _One Epistle_, â€œbut was only a
publisher; it being written by Mr. Welsted and others.â€[10]

As to the â€œothersâ€ we should remember Malletâ€™s caution that it would be
vain,

  To guess, ere _One Epistle_ saw the light,
  How many brother-dunces clubâ€™d their mite.[11]

Welsted himself had begun his quarrel with Pope with an attack on _Three
Hours after Marriage_, that amusing and much-abused play, in _Palaemon
To Caelia at Bath; Or, The Triumvirate_ (1717). Pope is said to have
collaborated with Gay not only in _Three Hours_, aÂ play â€œso lewd,/ Evâ€™n
Bullies blushâ€™d, and Beaux astonishâ€™d stoodâ€ (Second Edition, p.Â 11),
but in _The Wife of Bath_ and _The What Dâ€™Ye Call It_. Welsted also hits
at _Godâ€™s Revenge Against Punning_, the _First Psalm_, praises Tickell,
and finds Popeâ€™s versification flat. All of these charges (except the
one that Pope collaborated in _The Wife of Bath_) had appeared in print
before, but Pope was to remember _Palaemon To Caelia_ and include it in
a note to _The Dunciad A_ II.293, where it is neatly described as â€œmeant
for a Satire on Mr. P. and some of his friends.â€

In 1721 Welstedâ€™s name appears in the title of a pamphlet containing an
attack on Popeâ€™s Homer, _An Epistle To Mr. Welsted; And A Satyre on the
English Translations of Homer_, by that engagingly inept Dunce, Bezaleel
Morrice. In 1724 in the â€œDissertation concerning the Perfection of the
English Languageâ€ prefixed to his _Epistles, Odes, &c._, Welsted quoted
(not quite correctly) and criticized Popeâ€™s â€œAnd such as _Chaucer_ is,
shall _Dryden_ beâ€ (p.Â x). The anonymous author of _Characters of The
Times_ (1728) thought that Welsted would have been spared Popeâ€™s abuse
if he had not in his â€œDissertationâ€ â€œhappenâ€™d to cite a low and false
line from Mr. P[o]pe for the meer Purpose of refuting it, without
seeming to know, or care who was the Author of itâ€ (p.Â 24).[12]

In the _Peri Bathous_ Pope included Welsted as a didapper and an eel.
Pope then put him into _The Dunciad_ in II.293-300 and, more memorably,
in III.163-166:

  Flow Welsted, Flow! like thine inspirer, Beer,
  Thoâ€™ stale, not ripe; thoâ€™ thin, yet never clear;
  So sweetly mawkish, and so smoothly dull;
  Heady, not strong, and foaming thoâ€™ not full.

Unable to leave well enough alone, Welsted continued his attack on Pope
with _One Epistle_ and then again in January 1732 with _Of Dulness and
Scandal_, which ran to three editions. The half-title of _One Epistle_
had promised that it was to be continued, and the writer of the preface
had said that he intended â€œin the preface to the next Epistle ... to
state several Matters of Fact, in Contradiction to the Notes of the
_Dunciad_â€ (p.Â viii). _Of Dulness and Scandal_, however, has no preface
and is an independent attack. Its main charge is Popeâ€™s ingratitude to
the Duke of Chandos as shown in the _Epistle to Burlington_, aÂ famous
charge frequently to be repeated,[13] but it claims as well that a lady
named Victoria died as a result of reading Popeâ€™s Homer and attacks once
more _The Rape of the Lock_ and the _First Psalm_.

In February 1732 Welsted published his last attack on Pope, _Of False
Fame_, in which he attacks _Windsor Forest_, _The Rape of the Lock_,
Popeâ€™s edition of Shakespeare, _The Dunciad_, and the _Epistle to
Burlington_. Pope then mentioned him in the _Epistle to Arbuthnot_, at
first in l.Â 49, although he altered this to â€œPitholeon,â€ and then in
l.Â 375, where most twentieth-century college students first meet his
name.

The charges in _One Epistle_ are unusually comprehensive, but almost
none of them is original. To help the reader to evaluate the more
important, the following notes may be helpful. The denial in the preface
of Popeâ€™s statement that no one is attacked in _The Dunciad_ â€œwho had
not before, either in Print or private Conversation, endeavourâ€™d
something to his Disadvantageâ€ (p.Â v) is a reference to _The Dunciad_,
p.Â 203, where, however, conversation is not mentioned. This sentence of
Popeâ€™s annoyed many of the Dunces.[14] What the preface says about Swift
and Arbuthnot and the _Peri Bathous_ (p.Â vii) may well be true.[15]
Welstedâ€™s charge that Pope wrote the Prologue to _Cato_ and then â€œthe
Play decriedâ€ (p.Â 12) is simply Dennisâ€™s old charge first made in
_AÂ True Character of Mr. Pope (1716)_ and repeated in _Remarks Upon ...
the Dunciad_ (1729) that Pope had teased Lintot into publishing Dennisâ€™s
attack on _Cato_. The charge rests only on Dennisâ€™s authority.[16] The
obscenity of _The Rape of the Lock_ was an old story.[17] So was the
notorious _First Psalm_.[18] Welstedâ€™s attacks on the _Pastorals_, the
Homer, the _Peri Bathous_, and _The Dunciad_ are simply the commonplaces
of Popiana. The charge that he libeled Addison only after the great
manâ€™s death is also familiar[19] (Welsted seems to have been the first,
though, to mention the libel on Lady Mary) and long since disproved by
Sherburn and Ault. That Pope was a plagiarist is an idea that turns up
constantly.[20]

Welstedâ€™s other charges are more interesting. He seems to be the only
Dunce who objected (p.Â 12) to Popeâ€™s mentioning Bishop Hoadly in _The
Dunciad A_ II.368. It may just possibly be true that Gildon was
dismissed by Buckingham because of Gildonâ€™s dislike of Pope (p.Â 22).[21]

The most curious of the charges is that Pope,

    ... from the Skies, propitious to the Fair,
  Brought down _Caecilia_, and sent _Cloris_ there. (p.Â 11)

Welsted apparently means that Pope debased St. Cecilia in his _Ode for
Musick on St. Ceciliaâ€™s Day_ and glorified a suicide in his _Elegy to
the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady_. He is not saying, as did _The Life
of the late Celebrated Mrs. Elizabeth Wisebourn_ (1721), that the
heroine of the _Elegy_ died of her unrequited love for Pope. Popeâ€™s
note to l.Â 375 of the _Epistle to Arbuthnot_ accusing Welsted of having
â€œhad the Impudence to tell in print, that Mr. _P._ had occasionâ€™d a
Ladyâ€™s death, and to _name_ a person he never heard ofâ€ refers not to
Cloris but to Victoria in Welstedâ€™s _Of Dulness and Scandal_ who died
from reading Popeâ€™s _Illiad_.[22]

The _Grub-Street Journal_ for 21 May 1730 invited â€œany Person of Credit
and Character to stand forth and attest any of the following Facts....â€

  That the late Duke of Buckingham paid any Pension to Charles Gildon,
  which he took from him since his acquaintance with Mr.Â P.

  That the present Archbishop of Canterbury hath past any Censure on
  Mr.Â P.

  That Mr. F[ento]n and he ever were at distance on variance with each
  other.

  That the Rev. Mr. Br[oo]me ever asserted or complainâ€™d, he was not
  gratifyâ€™d with a competent Sum for his Share in the Odyssey; nay did
  not own that he thought himself highly paid.

  That Mr. Addison or any other but Mr. P. writ, or alterâ€™d, one line
  of the Prologue to Cato.

  Who will name any young Writer, allowâ€™d to have Merit, that hath
  been personally discouragâ€™d by him; or who hath not received either
  actual Services, or amicable Treatment from him?


III.

_The Blatant Beast_ appeared in December 1742, according to _The London
Magazine_; its authorship remains unknown. Pope had published _The New
Dunciad_ in March 1742, and Cibber had published his famous _A Letter
From Mr. Cibber, To Mr. Pope_ in July. Five other pamphlets attacking
Pope appeared in August, obviously capitalizing on the Cibber attack.

_The Blatant Beast_ is pro-Cibber, of course, but it criticizes
specifically only a few lines from _The New Dunciad_. The writerâ€™s chief
interest is in a general attack. The criticisms of the Shakespeare, of
_Three Hours_ and the _Epistle to Burlington_, and of Popeâ€™s plagiarism
are perfectly conventional. More interesting is the accusation (p.Â 6)
that Pope wrote (as, of course, he did) his Homer on the backs of
personal letters. Also interesting is the reference to Popeâ€™s
inscription on the Shakespeare monument in Westminster Abbey (p.Â 5).
Pope was, with several others, responsible for the Latin inscription;
it does not seem that he had anything to do with the lines from _The
Tempest_ IV.Â i.Â 152-156, which were added several months later. These
lines are given in the first note to _The DunciadÂ B_ I. and, in slightly
different form, in _The Gentlemanâ€™s Magazine_, XI,Â 276. The last line
reads, â€œLeave not a wreck behind.â€ Popeâ€™s version of the lines in both
his 1725 and 1728 editions of Shakespeare (Griffith 149 and 210) does
not commit the errors of the inscription and prints, â€œLeave not a rack
behind!â€[23] The bantering note about the monument which begins _The
DunciadÂ B_ may have been prompted by this passage in _The Blatant Beast_
as well as by the comment of Theobald which Sutherland refersÂ to.

But it is the shrill personal abuse of Popeâ€™s deformity and moral
obliquity,

  The Morals blackenâ€™d when the Writings scape;
  The libelâ€™d Person, and the picturâ€™d Shape

  (_Epistle to Arbuthnot_, ll. 353-353)

which is most impressive. The writer shows a talent for invective, but
there is a good deal of evidence that he was well-read in other Pope
attacks. The phrase, Popeâ€™s â€œMountain Shoulders,â€ (p.Â 5) recalls Popeâ€™s
â€œMountain Backâ€ in _The Difference Between Verbal and Practical Virtue_,
p.Â 5, published in August 1742. The image of the wasp (pp. 6, 10) had
appeared in Herveyâ€™s and Lady Maryâ€™s _Verses Addressâ€™d to the Imitator
Of ... Horace_ (1733), p.Â 7,[24] as had the metaphor of Pope as Satan
(pp.Â 5-6) with which _The Blatant Beast_ opens.[25]

Pope had already been pictured as a mad dog (p.Â 7) in _The
Metamorphosis_ (1728), attributed by Pope to Smedley and one of the
least pleasant of the pamphlets. Pope as Aesopâ€™s toad bursting with
spleen (p.Â 12) had been used in _Codrus_ (1728), p.Â 12, attributed by
Pope to Curll and Mrs. Thomas. Cibberâ€™s prevention of Pope from peopling
the isle with Calibans (p.Â 9) is a reference, of course, to Cibberâ€™s
famous anecdote about rescuing Pope in the bawdy-house; but in _Mr.
Taste, The Poetical Fop_ (1732) where Pope figures as the monkey-like
poetaster Taste, the servant-maid who was to have married him is
delighted the marriage is broken off, â€œfor fear our children should have
resembled Baboons, Ha, ha, ha!â€ (p.Â 73). Stern anti-sentimentalists
sometimes point out that we react too squeamishly to the abuse of Popeâ€™s
deformity. IÂ doubt it myself. The eighteenth century was probably a
coarser and more outspoken age than ours, but scurrilous attacks on the
physical appearance of distinguished poets do not otherwise seem to have
been a prominent feature of the Augustan literary scene.

It is hoped that both these pamphlets will prove useful to those who
have little first-hand knowledge of what his enemies said of Pope and
will help to warn the novice of the fatal ease with which we can read
â€œwith but a Lust to mis-apply,/ Make Satire a Lampoon, and Fiction, Lyeâ€
(_Epistle to Arbuthnot_, ll. 301-302).

_One Epistle_ was reprinted by John Nichols in his edition of _The
Works in Verse and Prose of Leonard Welsted_ (London, 1787). Nichols
normalizes the text, spells out several names in full, and adds several
unimportant notes. It is here reproduced from the copy in the Sterling
Library, Yale University. _The Blatant Beast_ has never been reprinted
and is reproduced from the copy in the Huntington Library.

  THE

  PREFACE.


_The indecent Images, and the frequent and bad Imitations of the
Classics in the _Dunciad_, have occasioned several just Observations
upon so new and coarse a Manner of Writing: IÂ shall wave this Topic at
present, and only regard the most plausible Insinuation in Favour of
this Author; which is, that he never begun an Attack upon any Person,
who had not before, either in Print or private Conversation, endeavourâ€™d
something to his Disadvantage._

_This Assertion is by no means true, as I shall immediately shew; if
it were true, it might indeed bear some Weight, but however with this
Distinction, that the Reports of private Conversation, brought to him by
such Emissaries, as belong to him, are not always to be believed, and
that no Attack in Print upon a Manâ€™s Poetical Character, ought to be
repaid by Lampoon and Virulence upon the Moral Character of his
Antagonist: Every Person has a Right to determine upon the Talents of
Writers, particularly of one, who appears in Publick only to gratify
the two worst Appetites, that disgrace Human Nature, IÂ mean Malice and
Avarice; and sure no Man deserves a violent Injury to his Reputation,
as a Gentleman, because perhaps at a Distance of several Years since
he might have said, that Mr. _Pope_ had nothing in him Original as a
Writer, that Mr. _Tickel_ greatly excelled him in his Translation of
_Homer_, and many of his Contemporaries in other Branches of Writing,
and that he is infinitely inferior to Mr. _Phillips_ in Pastoral: And
yet such Arguments or Apologies as these have been used by himself,
or his Tea-Table Cabals, for calling Gentlemen Scoundrels, Blockheads,
Gareteers, and Beggars,: If he can transmit them to Posterity under
such Imputations, he is a bad Man; if he cannot, he is a bad Writer:
IÂ believe, that he would rather suffer under the first Character, than
the last: But before I have done with him, IÂ will make a very strict
Inquiry into both._

_In the mean time I shall shew the Reader, in general, the Falshood of
his main Pretence, that he has meddled with no one, that had not before
hurt him, and in this View, thoâ€™ I should be ashamed of being too
serious in a Controversy of this Sort, IÂ think it proper to acquaint the
Town with the original Design of the _Dunciad_, and the real Reasons of
its Production. This Piece, which has been honourâ€™d by Booksellers of
Quality, contains only the Poetical Part of Dulness, extracted from a
Libel, callâ€™d, _The Progress of it_, and which included several other
Branches of Science, and perhaps some of those Gentlemen, who have in
the warmest Manner asserted the Cause of the _Dunciad_, might have seen
a Publication of a Work, upon the Death of this Writer, in which no past
Friendship could have screenâ€™d them from Lampoon for any Pretences to
excel in any Science whatever: It appears, therefore, that he was teazâ€™d
into a Publication of these Cantos, which regarded the Writers of the
Age, by some Attacks, that were made upon him about that Time: We must
refer to a Miscellany of Poems published by Him and _Swift_, to which
is prefixâ€™d, _An Essay on the Profund_, to consider if those Attacks
were justifiable; Mr. Dean _Swift_ never saw the _Profund_, till made
publick, and Dr. _Arburthnot_, who originally sketchâ€™d the Design of it,
desired that the Initial Letters of Names of the Gentlemen abused might
not be inserted, that they might be _A_ or _B_, or _Do_ or _Ro_, or any
thing of that Nature, which would make this Satire a general one upon
any dull Writers in any Age: This was refused by _Pope_, and he chose
rather to treat a Set of Gentlemen as Vermin, Reptiles, _&c._ at a Time
when he had no Provocation to do so, when he had closed his Labours,
finishâ€™d his great Subscriptions, and was in a fashionable Degree of
Reputation: Several Gentlemen, who are there ranked with the dullest
Men, or dullest Beasts, never did appear in Print against him, or say
any thing in Conversation which might affect his Character: Some
Replies, which were made to the _Profund_, occasioned the Publication of
the _Dunciad_, which was first of all begun with a general Malice to all
Mankind, and now appears under an Excuse of Provocations, which he had
received, after he himself had struck the first Blow in the
above-mentioned Miscellanies._

_I cannot indeed say much in Praise of some Performances, which appearâ€™d
against him, and am sorry that Voluntiers enterâ€™d into the War, whom I
could wish to have been only Spectators: But the Cause became so
general, that some Gentlemen, who never aimâ€™d at the Laurel, grew Poets
merely upon their being angry: AÂ Militia, in Case of publick Invasion,
may perhaps be thought necessary, but yet one could always wish for
an Army of regular Troops: IÂ should not have touched upon this
Circumstance, but to obviate some Imputations, which he had suggested,
of my Writing several Pieces, which I never heard of, till I saw them
with the rest of the Town: But these Suggestions shall be considered in
the Preface to the next Epistle, in which, among other Things, IÂ intend
to state several Matters of Fact, in Contradiction to the Notes of the
_Dunciad_, particularly as they concern the Writers of the following
Poem._

  E P I S T L E

  to

  Mr. _A.  P O P E_,

  Occasionâ€™d By

  Two Lately Publishâ€™d.

  If noble _B----m_, (a) in Metre known,
  With Strains has gracâ€™d thee, humble as thy own;
  Who (b) _G--l--n_â€™s Dullness did for thine discard,
  A better Critick, for as bad a Bard!
  Not unregarded let this Tribute be,
  Thoâ€™ humble, just; well-bred, thoâ€™ paid to Thee.

    _Parnassian_ Groves, and _Twickâ€™nam_ Fountains, say,
  What Homage to the Bard shall _Britain_ pay!
  The Bard! that first, from _Drydenâ€™s_ thrice-gleanâ€™d Page,
  Cullâ€™d his low Efforts to Poetic Rage;
  Nor pillagâ€™d only that unrivalâ€™d Strain,
  But rakâ€™d for Couplets * _Chapman_ and _Duck-Lane_,
  Has sweat each Centâ€™ryâ€™s Rubbish to explore,
  And plunderâ€™d every Dunce that writ before,
  Catching half Lines, till the tunâ€™d Verse went round,
  Complete, in smooth dull (c) Unity of Sound;
  Who, stealing Human, scornâ€™d Celestial Fire,
  And strung to _Smithfield_ Airs the â€  _Hebrew_ Lyre;
  Who taught declining (d) _Wycherley_ to doze
  Oâ€™er wire-drawn Sense, that tinkled in the Close,
  To lovely _F----r_ impious and obscene,
  To mud-born _Naiads_ faithfully unclean;
  Whose rapturâ€™d Nonsense, with Prophetick Skill,
  First taught that Ombre, which fore-ran Quadrille;
  Who from the Skies, propitious to the Fair,
  Brought down _CÃ¦cilia_, and sent ** _Cloris_ there,
  Censurâ€™d by _W--ke_, by _A------ry_ blest,
  Praisâ€™d _Sw----t_ in Earnest, and sung Heavâ€™n in Jest,
  Here, movâ€™d by Whim, and there by Envy stung,
  Would flatter _Ch----s_, or would libel â€¡ _Y----ge_,
  By _F----n_ left, by Reverend Linguists hated,
  Now learns to read the _Greek_ he once translated.

    [Footnote â€ : Burlesque of the first _Psalm_, more profest than
    _Sternboldâ€™s_.]

    [Footnote **: See Verses, in _P--pe_â€™s Poems, to the Memory of an
    unfortunate young Lady.]

    [Footnote â€¡: _Sir W. Y._]

    Oh say, to him what Trophies shall be raisâ€™d,
  That unprovokâ€™d will strike, and fawn unpraisâ€™d!
  Each favâ€™rite Toast who marks, or rising Wit,
  To sketch a Satire, that in Time may fit;
  Still hopes your Sun-set, while he views your Noon,
  And still broods oâ€™er the closely-kept Lampoon;
  The lurking Presents oâ€™er the Tomb he paid,
  And thus attonâ€™d our _British Virgil_â€™s Shade,
  A Mushroom * Satire in his Life concealâ€™d,
  Since changâ€™d to Libel, and in Print revealâ€™d;
  Who lets not â€  Beauty base Detraction â€™scape,
  And mocks Deformity with _Ã†sop_â€™s Shape;
  Who _Cato_â€™s Muse with faithless Sneers belied,
  The Prologue fatherâ€™d, and the Play decried,
  On â€¡ _H----y_â€™s learned Page, dull-sporting trod,
  Betrayâ€™d his Patrons, and lampoonâ€™d his God;
  Translator, Editor, could far out-go
  In _Homer_ _Ogleby_, in _Shakespeare_ _R----_
  O! how burlesquâ€™d, great _Dryden_, is thy Strain,
  When little _Alexander_ â€– _slays the Slain_!

        ------Fought all his Battles oâ€™er again;
        ------And thrice he _slew the Slain_.]

    On, mighty Rhimer, haste new Palms to seize,
  Thy little, envious, angry Genius teize;
  Let thy weak wilful Head, unreinâ€™d by Art,
  Obey the Dictates of thy flattâ€™ring Heart;
  Divide a busy, fretful Life between
  Smut, Libel, Sing-song, Vanity, and Spleen;
  With long-brewâ€™d Malice warm thy languid Page,
  And urge delirious Nonsense into Rage;
  Let bawdy Emblems, now, thy Hours beguile;
  Now, Fustian Epic, aping _Virgil_â€™s Stile;
  To _Virgil_ like, to _Indian_ Clay as _Delf_,
  Or _Pulteney_, drawn by _Jervase_, to Herself:
  Rheams heapâ€™d on Rheams, incessant, mayst thou blot,
  A lively, trifling, pert, one knows not what!
  Form thy light Measures, nimbler than the Wind,
  Whilst heavy lingring Sense is left behind;
  With all thy Might pursue, and all thy Will,
  That unabating Thirst, to scribble still,
  Givâ€™n at thy Birth! the Poetasterâ€™s Gust,
  False and unsated as the Eunuchâ€™s Lust!

    Illustrious Fops, mean time, oâ€™er-rate thy Lays,
  And blooming Critics, as they spell thee, praise:
  Blest Coupleteer! by blooming Critics read,
  At Toilets _ogled_, and with Sweetmeats fed:
  See, lisping Toilers grace thy _Dunciad_â€™s Cause,
  And scream their witty Scavengerâ€™s Applause,
  While powderâ€™d Wits, and lacâ€™d Cabals rehearse
  Thy bawdy _Cento_, and thy _Bead-roll_ Verse;
  Gay, bugled Statesmen on thy Side debate,
  And libelâ€™d Blockheads court thee, thoâ€™ they hate.
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  Fools of all Kinds their Suffrages impart,
  The Fools of Nature, and the Fools of Art.

    These in thy threadbare Farce shall Beauties show,
  Shall praise thy ribald Mirth, and maudlin Woe;
  Praise evâ€™n thy imitating _Chaucer_â€™s Tales,
  And call that merry * Temple, Fameâ€™s _Versailles_:
  Thy â€¡ Shepherd-Song with Rapture they shall see,
  Which rivals _Philips_, as _Banks_ rivals _Lee_;
  Thy â€  _Guernsey_ and _Barbados_ Wreath shall own,
  Where _Durfey_ neâ€™er was read, nor _Settle_ known;
  That Wreath, that Name, which throâ€™ both Worlds is gone,
  Which Doctor (e) _Y----_ applauds, and _Prestor John_.

  The Prelate! next, exilâ€™d by cruel Fates,
  Who plagues all Churches, and confounds all States;
  With Treasons past perplexâ€™d, and present Cares;
  A Fop in Rhime, and Bungler in Affairs.
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  And here! a Groupe of Brother Quill-men see,
  Co-witlings all, and Demi-bards like Thee;
  Such whom the Muse shall pass with just Disdain,
  Nor add one Trophy to thy mottly Train:
  But Quack _Arb----t_ shall Oblivion blot,
  That puzzling, plodding, prating, pedant _Scot_!
  The grating Scribler! whose untunâ€™d Essays
  Mix the _Scotch_ Thistle with the _English_ Bays,
  By either _PhÅ“bus_ pre-ordainâ€™d to Ill,
  The Hand prescribing, or the flattering Quill,
  Who doubly plagues, and boasts two Arts to kill!

    [Footnote â€–: The Characters left out here may perhaps be inserted
    in some future Edition of this Poem.]

    â€™Midst this vain Tribe, that aid thy setting Ray,
  The Muse shall view, but spare ill-faced _G--y_:
  Poor (f) _G--y_, who loses most when most he wins.
  And gives his Foes his Fame, and bears their Sins;
  Who more by Fortune than by Nature curst,
  Yields his best Pieces, and must own _Thy_ worst.

    Thus propâ€™d, thy Head with _Grub-street_ Zephyrs tainted,
  By (g) _Rich_ recorded, and by _J----_ painted;
  _J----!_ who so refinâ€™d a Rake is reckonâ€™d,
  He breaks all (h) _Sinai_â€™s Laws, except the Second:
  Thus praisâ€™d, thus drawn, tâ€™extend thy Projects try,
  Leave the _Blue * Languish_, and the Crimson Sigh;
  Leave the gay Epithets that Beauty crown,
  White ** _Whitylinda_, and _Brownissa_ Brown;
  Forget awhile (i) _Belinda_ and the Sun;
  Forget the _Fights of Stand_, and Flights of Run:
  No more let _Ombre_â€™s Play inspire thy Vein,
  Nor strow with Captive Kings the â€  _Velvet Plain_;
  Omit awhile the _Silver Peal_ to ring,      }
  Nor talk dulcissant, nor mellifluous sing,  }
  Nor _hang suspended_, nor _adherent cling_. }
  But haste to mount Immortal Envyâ€™s Throne,
  To crush all Merit, that disputes thy own;
  For thou wert born to damp each rising Name,
  And hang, like Mildews, on the Growth of Fame;
  Fameâ€™s fairest Blossoms let thy Rancour blast,
  Bane of the modern Laurel, like the past;
  While stupid Riot stands in Humourâ€™s Place,
  And bestial Filth, Humanityâ€™s Disgrace,
  Low Lewdness, unexcited by Desire,
  And all great â€ â€  _Wilmot_â€™s Vice, without his Fire.

    [Footnote *: The Phrases distinguished here in _Italics_, are
    truly quoted from _P----pe_; and the others in Company with them,
    ought to be in no other Company.]

    [Footnote **: See _Dunciad_. _Nigrina_ Black.]

    [Footnote â€ : Here a Card Table; in _P--pe_, a Field of Grass.]

    [Footnote â€ â€ : _Wilmot_, Earl of _Rochester_.]

    At length, when banishâ€™d _Pallas_ shall withdraw,
  And Witâ€™s made Treason by the _Popian_ Law;
  When minor Dunces cease, at length, their Strife,
  And own thy Patent to be dull for Life;
  By Tricks sustainâ€™d, in Poet-craft compleat,
  Retire triumphant to thy _Twickâ€™nam_ Seat;
  That Seat! the Work of (k) half-paid drudging _Br----me_,
  And callâ€™d by joking _Tritons_, _Homer_â€™s Tomb:
  There to stale, stolâ€™n, stum Crambo bid adieu,
  And sneer the Fops, that thought thy Crambo new;
  There, like the _Grecian_ Chief, on whom thy Song
  Has well revengâ€™d unhappy _Priam_â€™s Wrong;
  Waste, in thy hidden Cave, the Festive Day,
  With mock _Machaon_, and _Patroclus G----_
  _Sleep_, (l) _Sleep in Peace_ the Works, for _Wapping_ born!
  No more thy Cuckoo Note shall wake the Morn;
  In Ease, and Avarice, and aukward State,
  _The Fool of Fortune_, shalt thou hail thy Fate;
  Slumbring in Quiet oâ€™er Lampoons half writ,
  Which, ripe in Malice, only wait for Wit.

    So when _Vanessa_ yielded up her Charms,
  The blest _Cadenus_ languishâ€™d in her Arms;
  High, on a Peg, his unbrushâ€™d Beaver hung,
  His Vest unbuttonâ€™d, and his God unsung;
  Rapturâ€™d he lies; Deans, Authors are forgot,
  _Wood_â€™s Copper Pence, and _Atterbury_â€™s Plot;
  For her he quits the Tythes of _Patrick_â€™s Fields,
  And all the Levite to the Lover yields.

NOTES

On the Foregoing

POEM.


(a) _If Noble _B------m_,_

The late Duke of _Buckingham!_ who made that fine Alteration of the
Tragedy of _Julius CÃ¦sar_ from _Shakespeare_, and who is said by Mr.
_Pope_ to have bestowâ€™d the finest Praise upon _Homer_ that he ever
received, in the following Lines;

  Read _Homer_ once, and you need read no more;
  For all Things else will be so mean and poor,
  Verse will seem Prose: Yet often on him look,
  And you will never need another Book.

    D---- of B----â€™s Essay on Poetry.

He has also printed a Copy of Verses in Praise of _Pope_, which were
returned by another in Praise of his Grace. There is so great a
Similitude in the Stile of these Writers, that the Reader, IÂ think, need
not doubt their Sincerity in admiring each other.

  â€™Tis great Delight to laugh at some Mens Ways;
  But â€™tis much greater to give Merit Praise.

    D---- of B----.

  _Sheffield_ approves, consenting _PhÅ“bus_ bends,
  And I and Malice from this Hour, am Friends.

    Pope.


(b) _Who _G------n_â€™s Dulness------_

_Charles Gildon_, dismissâ€™d from the D----â€™s Pension and Favour, on
Account of his Obstinacy in refusing to take the Oaths to _P--pe_â€™s
Supremacy.


(c) _Smooth dull Unity of Sound._

_P--pe_â€™s Reputation for versifying is a vulgar Error, founded only on
discreet Theft: Half a Line from Mr. _Dryden_â€™s _Conquest of Mexico_,
and another from his Translation of _Virgil_, have seemingly made
tolerable Music, when joinâ€™d in his Works; but Music of the _Morocco_
Kind, which has but one Note.


(d) _Who taught declining _Wycherley_------_

Mr. _Wycherley_ subscribed to a Compliment (some say, before his Death)
upon _P--pe_â€™s Pastorals, in which he says, his _Arcadia speaks the
Language of the Mall_, but does not explain, whether he means at Noon or
Night. IÂ do not agree with what Mr. _Wycherley_ is supposed to have writ
of him, but I do with what he certainly said of him, _viz._ _That he was
not able to make a Suit of Cloaths, but could perhaps turn an old Coat._


(e) _Which Doctor _Y------__

The Reverend Doctor _Edward Young_, who, in this Quarrel of the great
contending Powers in Poesy, has been courted by all Sides: But some late
Incidents give a Suspicion, that he has privately acceded to the _Treaty
of Twickenham_.


(f) _Poor _G----_, who loses most----_

Mr. _Gay_, not thought to be the entire Author of the _Beggarâ€™s Opera_,
and ordered to own _Three Hours after Marriage_.


(g) _By _Rich_ recorded------_

_Gilbert Pickering Rich._ A great Admirer of _P--pe_, eminent for his
Translation of _Horace_, which can be equallâ€™d by nothing but _P--pe_â€™s
translating of _Homer_. He concludes the first Ode by giving (_sublimi
feriam sidera vertice_) in these Words;

  Iâ€™ll bound, Iâ€™ll spring, Iâ€™ll strike the weakenâ€™d Pole,
  Iâ€™ll knock so hard, Iâ€™ll knock throâ€™ it a Hole.


(h) _------Breaks all _Sinai_â€™s Laws except the Second._

Second Commandment: â€œThou shalt not make the Likeness of any Thing in
Heaven above, or on the Earth beneath, or the Waters under the Earth.â€


(i) _Forget awhile _Belinda_ and the Sun._

In the _Rape of the Lock_, _Belinda_ and the Sun are very often said to
be very much alike, which occasionâ€™d two Lines in Praise of that Poem,
written by a Friend of Mr. _Pope_;

  Here, like the Sun, _Belinda_ strikes the Swain,
  In the same Page like the same Sun again.

Monsieur _Boileau_, speaking of the Poetasters of his Nation, in a Poem
to the King, makes this Comparison the Consummation of Dulness;

      _Et enfin te compare au SolÅ“il._

And in the End he compares your Majesty to the Sun.


(k) _------Half-paid drudging _B----me_._

The Reverend Mr. _B----me_, who translated a great Part of _Homer_, and
construed the Rest: _N.B. AÂ half-paid Poet_ is oftentimes the Occasion
of an _unpaid Taylor_.


(l) _Sleep, Sleep in Peace------_

These Lines are a Parody of a famous Passage in the Tragedy of _PhÃ¦dra_
and _Hyppolitus_.

  Sleep, Sleep in Peace, ye Monsters of the Wood:
  No more my early Horn shall wake------

    _So when bright _Venus_ yielded up her Charms,
  The blest _Adonis_ languishâ€™d in her Arms;
  His idle Horn on flagrant Myrtle hung,
  His Arrows scatterâ€™d, and his Bow unstrung;
  Obscure in Covert lay his dreaming Hounds,
  And bayâ€™d the fancyâ€™d Boar with feeble Sounds:
  For nobler Sports he quits the savage Fields,
  And all the Hero to the Lover yields._

  POEM.


  What is that Blatant-Beast? Then he replyâ€™d.
    It is a Monster bred of hellish Race,
  Then answered he, which often hath annoyâ€™d
  Good Knights and Ladies true, and many else destroyâ€™d.

  The

  _BLATANT-BEAST_

  a

  POEM.


  Beauty, the fondling Motherâ€™s earliest Prayâ€™r,
  Natureâ€™s kind Gift to sweeten worldly Care.
  Beauty the greatest Extasy imparts,
  Steals throâ€™ our Eyes, and revels in our Hearts;
  Adds Lustre to a Crown, gives Weight to Sense,
  The Orator assists in Truthâ€™s Defence.
  The very Fool our Hearts resistless warms,
  And while we curse the Tongue, the Figure charms.
  If Beauty be the Subject of our Praise,
  A rude, mishapen Lump Contempt must raise.

    When _Lucifer_ with Angels held first Place,
  Seraphic Beauty sparkled in his Face.
  By Pride and Malice tempted to rebel,
  Vengeance pursuâ€™d him to the lowest Hell:
  Not sulphâ€™rous Lakes sufficâ€™d, nor dreary Plains;
  Deformity was joinâ€™d tâ€™ improve his Pains.

    Paint then the Person, and expose the Mind,
  Who rails at others, to his own Faults blind.
  Sly _Sancho_â€™s Paunch, meagre _Don Quixot_â€™s Love,
  The Satyr and the Ridicule improve.
  So when famâ€™d _Butler_ wouâ€™d Rebellion paint,
  He lasht the Traitor and the Mimic Saint.
  Sir _Hudibras_ he sung; the crumpled Wight,
  Contempt and Laughter ever will excite.

    The Blatant-Beast once more has broke his Chains,
  Disperses Falshoods, and remorseless reigns.
  Scornful of all thy Verses dare design,
  (Where useless Epithets crowd evâ€™ry Line,)
  The Blatant-Beast shall be afresh pursuâ€™d,
  Nor cease my Labours till again subduâ€™d.

    Distorted Elf! to Nature a Disgrace,
  Thy Mind envenomâ€™d picturâ€™d in thy Face;
  Malice with Envy in thy Breast combines,
  And in thy Visage gravâ€™d those ghastly Lines.
  Like Plagues, like Death thy rancâ€™rous Arrows fly,
  At Good and Bad, at Friend and Enemy.
  To thy own Breast recoils the erring Dart,
  Corrupts thy Blood, and rankles in thy Heart.
  There swell the Poisons which thy Breast distend,
  And with the Load thy Mountain Shoulders bend.
  Horrid to view! retire from human Sight,
  Nor with thy Figure pregnant Dames affright.
  Crawl throâ€™ thy childish Grot, growl round thy Grove,
  A Foe to Man, an Antidote to Love.
  In Curses waste thy Time instead of Prayâ€™r,
  (a) And with thy Breath pollute the fragrant Air.
  There doze oâ€™er _Shakespear_; then thy Blunders fell
  (b) At mighty Price; this Truth let _Tonson_ tell.
  Then frontless intimate, (oh perjurâ€™d Bard!)
  Thy Labours were bestowâ€™d without Reward.
  On that immortal Author wreak thy Spite,
  (c) And on his Monument thy Nonsense write.
  Should _Theobald_ thy presumptuous Errors shew,
  Be thou to _Theobald_ an invetâ€™rate Foe.
  _Cibber_ shall foremost in thy Satyrs stand;
  His Plays succeed, and thine was justly damnâ€™d.
  But _Colley_ call him, when thou wouldâ€™st declame;
  Great is the Jest that lies in _Colley_â€™s Name.

    [Footnote a: It is surely allowable to treat a Man after this
    manner who abuses all others, and to make this just Reflexion,
    since in his new _Dunciad_ he not only calls _Mummius_ a Fool,
    but uses this filthy Expression--who stinks above the Ground.]

    [Footnote b: See this farther explained in the ingenious Dialogues
    of _Sawney_ and _Colley_.]

    [Footnote c: Thoâ€™ he was informed that Wreck was improper, yet he
    was resolvâ€™d it should be inscribâ€™d, because the Nonsense was in
    his Edition of _Shakespear_.]

    Beware all ye, whom he as Friends carest,
  How ye entrust your Secrets to his Breast.
  (a) On Backs of Letters was his _Homer_ wrote,
  All your Affairs disclosâ€™d to save a Groat.
  He valuâ€™d not to whom he gave Offence;
  He savâ€™d his Paper, thoâ€™ at your Expence.

    [Footnote a: When he sent his _Homer_ to his Acquaintance for
    their Emendations, it was written on the Back of the Letters of
    his Correspondents, whether of Business, Complement or Secrecy.
    AÂ shameful Instance of Avarice and Treachery!]

    But shall a low-born Wretch the best traduce,
  And call it Poetry, because Abuse?
  The Heavâ€™n-born Muse, by Truth and Justice swayâ€™d,
  To false Aspersions neâ€™er vouchsafes her Aid.
  When unprovokâ€™d, not vengeful Wasps molest,
  Nor dart their Stings, when undisturbâ€™d their Nest.
  Thy Muse, by _Virgil_â€™s Harpies taught to write,
  Scatters her Ordure in her screaming Flight;
  Sacred Religion and her Priests defames,
  And against Monarchs saucily exclames.
  (a) The Fathers, of our Church the surest Guides,
  As a poor Pack of Punsters she derides.
  But chief O _Cam!_ and _Isis!_ dread her Frown,
  (b) Chainâ€™d to the Footstool of the Goddessâ€™ Throne.
  No Order, no Degree escapes her Rage,
  And dull, and dull, and dull swells evâ€™ry Page.
  Thirsty, she Poison draws from evâ€™ry Flowâ€™r,
  Like Satan, seeks whom next she may devour.

    [Footnote a: _Vide_ Notes on the new _Dunciad_.]

    [Footnote b: Goddess of Dullness.]

    So have I seen a Dog distracted roam;
  He bites, he snaps at all, disgorging Foam.
  The frightenâ€™d Passenger the Danger flies,
  And sees the Poison flashing from his Eyes.
  Till some stout Dray-man dashes out his Brains,
  And his corrupted Blood the Kennel stains.

    Thy Notes pedantic shall no more engage;
  _Arbuthnot_â€™s Wit enlivens not the Page.
  Thy Muse, that Prostitute abandonâ€™d Jade,
  Now flounders in the Mire without _Swift_â€™s Aid.
  Thy base Invectives Men no more regard;
  With just Disdain thy Scare-Crow Muse is heard.

    So when the latent Seeds their Fruits display,
  And gain fresh Vigour from a genial Ray:
  The careful Hind a monstâ€™rous Figure frames;
  From various Rags unwonted Terror streams.
  The featherâ€™d Choristers in Flocks retreat,
  And at a Distance view the tempting Bait.
  At length grown bold, they perch upon his Head,
  And with their Meute bedawb what late they fled.

    _B-ns-n_ abuse for raising _Milton_â€™s Bust,
  And impiously molest learnâ€™d _Johnston_â€™s Dust.
  Religious, he the Psalms in _Latin_ sung,
  From hence the Malice of the Deist sprung.
  While with a just Derision we survey,
  Thy wretched Epitaph on poor _John Gay_.

    Had _Peter_, _Charters_ thee with Gold supplyâ€™d,
  _Peter_ and _Charters_ had been deifyâ€™d.
  But evâ€™ry Lord, each genâ€™rous Friend implore,
  And by Subscriptions meanly swell thy Store.
  When to the Town by sordid Intâ€™rest led,
  Mump for a Dinner, flatter for a Bed.
  Then to thy Grot retire, indulge thy Spite,
  And rail at those who for Subsistence write.
  Summon thy Rags, invoke thy scurril Muse,
  With keenest Malice _Addison_ abuse.
  Sculking, the Scandal privately disperse,
  (a) Then own in Prose the Baseness of thy Verse.

    [Footnote a: He writ a vile Lampoon on Mr. _Addison_, and then in
    a Preface owns, he deserves Respect from every Lover of Learning.]

    So eâ€™re _Arachne_ to her Cell repairs,
  Insidiously she weaves her glewy Snares.
  Sullen, she meditates on Deaths to come,
  And meliorates the Poison in her Womb.
  (b) Should hapless _Clarion_ thither take his Flight,
  He falls her Prey, mindful of ancient Spite.

    [Footnote b: _Vide_ _Spencer_â€™s Fate of the Butterfly.]

    With Malice swollâ€™n, Pride, Envy, Avarice,
  Ingratitude attends this Train to Vice.
  Yet one remains untold; with Lust enduâ€™d,
  Behold the Fribler labâ€™ring to be lewd.
  Kind _Cibber_ interposâ€™d, forbad the Banns,
  Heâ€™d peopled else this Isle with _Calibans_.

    (a) The noble _Timon_, in thy waspish Strains,
  A Proof of thy Ingratitude remains.
  Courteous to all, munificent, humane,
  Subject of others Praise, to thee of Pain.
  Exalted far above thy groveling State,
  The Object of his Pity, not his Hate.
  He smiles at Scandal so unjustly thrown,
  And at thy Malice he disdains to frown.

    [Footnote a: _Vide_ a Poem on Taste.]

    Thus oft we see a currish, Mungrel Crew,
  A stately Mastiff eagerly pursue.
  They swarm around, they yelp, they snarl, they grin,
  Bold in Appearance, timerous within:
  With such mean Foes he deigns not to engage,
  But lifts his Leg, and pisses out their Rage.

    How darâ€™st thou, Peasant, give thy Pen this Loose?
  Becomes it thee thus madly to traduce?
  The Great, the Low, the Virtuous, and the Base,
  Alike are grown thy Subject of Disgrace.
  Safe in thy Weakness, thou defiâ€™st a Foe;
  Eâ€™en (b) _Cibber_â€™s Cudgel scornâ€™d to stoop so low.
  The Mercy of the Law restrains thy Fears;
  _Coventry_â€™s Act secures thy Nose and Ears.
  Yet there remains, to fill thy Soul with Care,
  A Blanket to curvet thee in the Air.

    [Footnote b: _Vide_ _Cibber_â€™s Letter to _Pope_.]

    O wretched Life consumâ€™d in restless Pains,
  Where Dread of Punishment incessant reigns!
  Poor Self-Tormentor! in whose gloomy Breast
  The Vulture dwells, inhospitable Guest.
  Be to my Foe no greater Curse assignâ€™d!
  Than a malignant Heart and envious Mind.

    Thrice happy he! thatâ€™s with Good Nature blest,
  Love of his Species rules his tender Breast;
  Nor there confinâ€™d: The Brute Creation share
  His kind Beneficence and genâ€™rous Care.
  No base malicious Thoughts his Peace annoy:
  Are others happy? he partakes their Joy.
  Chearful and innocent the Day he spends,
  And Silver Sleep his quiet Nights attends.

    But thou, a Stranger to this Peace of Mind,
  Search where thou mayâ€™st conspicuous Merit find:
  There strive to blacken with thy utmost Art,
  And rail the more, the greater the Desert.

    Is there a Man, an Honour to the Age,
  Unsullyâ€™d by the keenest Party-rage;
  By Vice untainted; who, from early Youth,
  Firmly adherâ€™d to Honour, Justice, Truth;
  Whom no unruly Passions eâ€™re couâ€™d blind,
  Nor ruffle his Serenity of Mind;
  His Countryâ€™s Good, the Patriotâ€™s noblest View,
  Unbribâ€™d, unawâ€™d, does stedfastly pursue;
  Polite in Manners, and reverâ€™d his Sense,
  And long in Senates famâ€™d for Eloquence;
  But if to these Endowments of the Mind,
  A graceful Figure happily is joinâ€™d,
  Then flows thy Gall, then raves thy half-formâ€™d Clay,
  Then frets thy putrid Carcass to Decay.

    So when the croaking Toad the Ox beheld,
  His envious Heart with Indignation swellâ€™d.
  Vainly the Reptil thought he could extend
  His bloated Form, and Natureâ€™s Error mend.
  He drew his Breath; he swellâ€™d--he burst; he dyâ€™d
  A Victim to his Arrogance and Pride.
