SIGNELIL


The Lady her handmaid to questioning took:
‚ÄúWhy dost thou so sickly and colourless look?‚Äù
   _But sorrow gnaws so sorely_!

‚Äú‚ÄôTis little wonder if sickly I‚Äôm growing,
   _Malfred my lady_!
So much am I busied with cutting and sewing.‚Äù

‚ÄúErewhile was thy cheek as the blooming rose red,
But now thou art pale, even pale as the dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo conceal the truth longer ‚Äôtis vain to essay,
My gallant young master has led me astray.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if the young noble has led thee astray,
Say, what gave he thee for thy virtue in pay?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe gave to me shoes were gold spangled all o‚Äôer,
And them have I worn with affliction so sore.

‚ÄúHe gave to me also of silk a soft shift,
And with sorrow most painful I‚Äôve worn the fair gift.

‚ÄúHe gave me, Christ sain him! a gold ring so fine,
Whose match I can see on no finger of thine.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what will avail thee his presents of price,
If he thee will not wed before God and men‚Äôs eyes?‚Äù

‚ÄúO, he to espouse me so often has vowed,
And rich presents beside upon me has bestowed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat will his vows help thee in secrecy spoke?
To many a maid them he has made and has broke.‚Äù

‚ÄúO, I on the gold harp will play me a tune,
And the knight to his presence will summon me soon.‚Äù

With her fingers so tapering she struck the first chord,
That heard, as he dozed in his bed, the young lord.

The gallant young lord to his waiting-boy said:
‚ÄúGo straight, and call hither my mother‚Äôs fair maid.‚Äù

The bedside he stroked with so gentle an air:
‚ÄúDear heart, sit thee down, for thy weight it will bear.‚Äù

‚ÄúO no, by the Saints, I will never do that,
For there, noble Sir, I have ne‚Äôer before sat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThough thou ne‚Äôer hast placed thee upon my bedside,
Thou hast slept in my arms embraced many a tide.

‚ÄúMy spouse thou shalt be, yea, my heart‚Äôs beloved spouse,
And I in thine arms every night will repose.‚Äù




A TALE FROM THE CORNISH


   In Lavan‚Äôs parish once of yore,
Dwelt on the spot called Tshei an Hor,
A loving couple, man and wife,
But poverty distressed their life.
And thus the man his wife address‚Äôd:
‚ÄúI‚Äôll wander forth of work in quest;
And you, my dearest, you can earn
Your living here till I return.‚Äù

   His home he leaves, and, far from gay,
Towards the East he took his way.
At length a farmer‚Äôs dwelling reaching,
He enter‚Äôd it, for work beseeching.
‚ÄúWhat work canst do?‚Äù the farmer cried;
‚ÄúAll kinds of work, Sir,‚Äù John replied.
Then straight they for a year agree,
Three pounds the wages were to be.

And when the year to end had come
The master paid him down the sum.
‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù said his master, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs your fee;
But if you‚Äôll it return to me,
A point of wisdom I will teach you.‚Äù
Said John: ‚ÄúGive it me, I beseech you.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, no, to give is not my way.‚Äù
‚ÄúTake it,‚Äù said John, ‚Äúand say your say.‚Äù
Quoth t‚Äôother: ‚ÄúThis in memory hold:
_Ne‚Äôer for the new road leave the old_.‚Äù

They for another year agree,
The wages just the same to be;
And when the year its end had reached,
The farmer forth the three pounds fetched.
‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù said his master, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs your fee,
But if you‚Äôll it return to me,
A point of wisdom I will teach you.‚Äù
‚ÄúGive it me, Sir, I do beseech you.‚Äù
‚ÄúFor nought I will not speak, not I.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, take it then,‚Äù was John‚Äôs reply.
Quoth t‚Äôother: ‚Äú_Lodge not_, _for your life_,
_With an old man who‚Äôs a young wife_.‚Äù

For yet a year they then agree,
The wages still the same to be.
And when the year to end had roll‚Äôd,
The three pounds out the master told.
‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù said the master, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs your fee;
But if you‚Äôll it return to me,
I‚Äôll the best point of wisdom learn you.‚Äù
‚ÄúFor that, Sir, I‚Äôll the wage return you.‚Äù
The farmer said: ‚Äú_Take this advice_,
_Ere striking once_, _bethink thee twice_.‚Äù

Now John would serve no longer there,
Home to his wife he would repair.
‚ÄúGo not to-day,‚Äù the farmer spake,
‚ÄúTo-morrow‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs day to bake;
She shall for you prepare a cake
Home to your faithful wife to take.‚Äù

The nine pounds in the loaf they hid,
And when John them adieu had bid,
The farmer cried: ‚ÄúI pray thee carry
This present home unto your deary;
And as ye two there merry make,
Then, and not till then, part the cake.‚Äù

John turned him homeward from the door;
And when he reach‚Äôd St. Eler‚Äôs Moor,
He met three Tre-ryn merchants there
Returning home from Exeter.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre glad to see thee, John,‚Äù they cried,
‚ÄúWhere hast thou been this long, long tide?‚Äù
Says John: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just from service come,
And to my wife am journeying home.‚Äù
‚ÄúO travel with us,‚Äù cried all three,
‚ÄúAnd very welcome shalt thou be.‚Äù

Before them two roads they behold;
They took the new, John kept the old.
And as they passed by Keou Tshoy Un,
When they had just lost sight of John,
Thieves set upon them furiously,
Whereat they raised a doleful cry,
Which reaching John‚Äôs ears on his rout,
‚ÄúMurder!‚Äù and ‚ÄúThieves!‚Äù he bellowed out.

His clamour scared the robber train,
Who from the merchants sped amain.
And when they came to Market Jew
They to their joy met John anew,
And cried: ‚ÄúWhat thanks we owe thee, John!
We had for certain, every one,
Been ruined people, but for thee,
Come with us, thou‚Äôlt most welcome be.‚Äù

And when they reached the hostelrie
At which it was their wont to lie,
Quoth John: ‚ÄúThe master I must view.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe master! what with him wouldst do?‚Äù
They answered, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve a mistress here,
And young enough she is, and fair;
To see the host, if you‚Äôre inclined,
Him in the kitchen you will find.‚Äù

Into the kitchen John he goes,
And sees the master of the house,
An ancient man who turned the spit.
‚ÄúO, ho!‚Äù said John, ‚Äúthis house I quit;
No sleeping place of it I‚Äôll make,
But in the next will quarters take.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo not go yet,‚Äù they cried all three,
‚ÄúStay, sup with us, thou‚Äôlt welcome be.‚Äù

And now, with grief and shame, I say
That with a friar of orders grey
The mistress had contrived a plan
To murder the poor ancient man,
When sleep had bound the merchants fast,
And on their heads the crime to cast.

John in the next house that same night
Saw through a hole i‚Äô the wall a light.
So getting up and gently walking,
He heard the friar and woman talking.
The friar said: ‚ÄúAgainst yon hole
My back I‚Äôll set, for fear some soul
From the next house our deeds should spy.‚Äù

The hostess then most cruelly,
With a silk handkerchief she bore,
Murdered her ancient husband poor,
Strangled him did the accursed slut.
But meanwhile through the hole John cut
A round piece from the friar‚Äôs gown,
And then in bed again lay down.

At morn ran out the hostess crying
That murdered was her husband lying;
And since nor man nor child had been,
Except the merchants, in the inn,
They should be hanged withouten fail;
They thereupon were led to jail.
John quickly them a visit paid.
‚ÄúO, John! we‚Äôve evil luck,‚Äù they said;
‚ÄúLast night the host was choked in bed,
And upon us the crime is laid.‚Äù

‚ÄúDear gentlemen,‚Äù was John‚Äôs reply,
‚ÄúBeseech the Justice instantly
To cause them who the murder wrought
Into his presence to be brought.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut who knows who the deed has done?‚Äù
They faltered forth; then answered John:
‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt prove who did it, I
Will hang for it most willingly.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpeak out,‚Äù they cried.  Said John: ‚ÄúLast night,
Being in bed, I saw a light;
I rose, as if I‚Äôd had a call‚Äî
There was a hole in the house wall,
‚ÄôGainst which his back a certain friar
Placed, thereby blinding it entire,
Lest, as he said, some curious eye
From the next house their deeds should spy.
I cut, meanwhile, to him unknown,
A large round piece from off his gown.
To prove that what I‚Äôve said is true
I‚Äôve in my pouch the piece to shew.‚Äù
The merchants then were soon set free;
The murderers died on gallows tree.

All three depart from Market Jew,
Together with their comrade true,
Far as Kuz carn na Huila went,
And thence their ways lay different.
Now though the merchants earnest were
That John should with them home repair,
He steadfastly refused their plea,
Longing his wife and home to see.

When of the merchants he lost sight
He lounged away his time till night.
He‚Äôd fain know whether, while he roved
Abroad, his consort faithful proved.

Arrived, he listened at the door,
And heard a man‚Äôs voice, he was sure,
Within the bed; his knife he drew,
Resolved to slay the guilty two.
But soon remembering the advice,
‚Äú_Ere striking once_, _bethink thee twice_,‚Äù
In hurry from the door he strode,
But soon returning knocked aloud.

‚ÄúIn name of God, who‚Äôs there?‚Äù she cried;
‚Äú‚ÄôTis I am here, wife,‚Äù John replied.
(‚ÄúNow in the name of blest Marie,
Whom heard I in her company?‚Äù)
‚ÄúIf John thou art, pray enter free.‚Äù
‚ÄúFirst bring the light here,‚Äù answered he.
‚ÄôTwas brought, he stepped the threshold o‚Äôer.
Quoth he: ‚ÄúOn coming to the door
I heard a man‚Äôs voice in the bed.‚Äù
‚ÄúAh, Johnny, when away you sped
In distant parts for work to roam,
I then with child was three months gone;
In bed there lies a comely boy,
Unto us both he‚Äôll be a joy.‚Äù

Said John, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve something to disclose.
My master, when I left his house,
Gave me this cake I have in hand,
And with it gave the strict command
When I with thee should merry make
Then and not till then it to break.
I‚Äôll now accomplish what he bade,
Mayhap we‚Äôve wherefor to be glad.‚Äù

They broke the cake in anxious haste,
The nine pounds in it, lo! were placed.
They took the money, ate the bread,
And I for truth have heard it said
No quarrel e‚Äôer or noisy word
‚ÄôTwixt them from that time forth occurr‚Äôd.

   Now, Gentles all, my tale is done,
I hope it has your favour won!




SIR VERNER AND DAME INGEBORG


         In Linholm‚Äôs house
The swains they were drinking and making carouse.
   _The Dames ne‚Äôer could so gallant a prisoner keep in_.

The swains they drank deep and they made themselves gay,
And so did Sir Verner in prison that lay.

Dame Ingeborg woke, and she lifts up her eyes:
‚ÄúO, which of my maidens doth sing in that guise?‚Äù

‚ÄúO, none of your maidens can sing in such guise,
‚ÄôTis Sir Verner who‚Äôs singing, in durance he lies.‚Äù

Dame Ingeborg straightway two servants addressed:
‚ÄúTo come to my presence Sir Verner request.‚Äù

In through the portal Sir Verner he strode,
And up to receive him Dame Ingeborg stood.

To the cushion Dame Ingeborg points with a smile:
‚ÄúGo thither, Sir Verner, and rest thee awhile.

‚ÄúNow hark thou, Sir Verner, what I to thee say:
I beg thou wilt sing me a pretty love lay.‚Äù

‚ÄúA love lay I‚Äôve never learnt up to this hour,
But I‚Äôll sing to oblige thee the best in my power.‚Äù

Sir Verner began, and he sang such a lay,
That soon in deep slumber Dame Ingeborg lay.

The Dames and the maids fell to sleep and to doze,
Dame Ingeborg sank to a peaceful repose.

Sir Verner he glanced then so cautiously round,
The keys great and small in a nook he has found.

To the door hied Sir Verner as fast as he might,
He forgot to bid Dame Ingeborg a good-night.

When out of the castle himself he perceived,
His voice in a ditty again he upheaved.

Sir Verner he waved up his hat with delight:
‚ÄúDame Ingeborg bid ye a very good night!

‚ÄúAnd hear thou, Sir Warden, who stand‚Äôst on thy watch,
Of my ditty the burden I pray thee to catch.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôd this e‚Äôen not have taken a bushel of gold,
Now no penny for me shall she ever behold.‚Äù

So fast to the door went Sir Verner the knight,
He forgot to bid Damsel or Lady good-night.




THE HEDDEBY SPECTRE {22}


At evening fall I chanced to ride,
My courser to a tree I tied.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

Against a stump my head I laid,
And then to slumber I essay‚Äôd.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

As soon as sleep had closed my eye,
The murdered man to me drew nigh.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúAnd if thy race to mine belongs,
I call thee to avenge my wrongs.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúAnd them to Heddeby shalt ride,
For there my kith and kin reside.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúMy father dwells there, and my mother,
There dwell my sister and my brother.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúThere Kirsten dwells, my lovely wife,
And it was she who took my life.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúHer sleeping husband stifled she,
With aid of cursed beldames three.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúThen in a truss of hay concealed,
They brought me forth to this wide field.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúThe page I loved the best of all,
Now rides upon my courser tall.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúEats daily with my silver knife,
And sleeps with Kirsten fair, my wife.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúHe sitteth highest at the board,
My children tremble at his word.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúTo them he gives so little bread,
And mocks them now that I am dead.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúHe rides about the forest grounds,
And hunts the red deer with my hounds.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúEach time the caitiff slays a deer,
He wakes me in my grave so drear.
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.

‚ÄúBut if I to him once repair,
With him ‚Äôtwill sorely, sorely fare.‚Äù
   _So wide thereof the story goes_.




FROM GOUDELI


Yestere‚Äôen when the bat, and the owl, and his mate,
   Were holding discourse their small matters about;
   And the sun, that the wee little stars might shine out,
Had extinguished the lamp of his lustre so great.

A shepherd exclaimed: ‚ÄúO ‚Äôtwas folly that I
   My love should bestow upon one never kind,
   Upon Siris the lovely, whose cold, cruel mind,
Would suffer unmoved a true lover to die.

‚ÄúOften times, when our flocks on the common did browse,
I‚Äôd approach her to pour in her ear my fond vows,
   But unto her companions to haste she was sure.
O, light of my eyes! wouldst thou render me blest,
And wouldst grant me two kisses on thy snowy breast,
   I swear that each one should an hour endure!‚Äù




PEASANT SONGS OF SPAIN


1.


When Jesu our Redeemer
   To him the twelve did call,
By threes and fours he called them,
   Till they were mustered all.

And when they all were mustered,
   ‚ÄôTwas thus to them he spake:
‚ÄúO which of ye, my children,
   Will perish for my sake?‚Äù

Then, gazing on each other,
   They stood abashed and still;
All save Saint John the Baptist,
   And Peter of the Hill.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll die for thee, O Jesus,
   Upon to-morrow‚Äôs morn.‚Äù
For him died John the Baptist,
   And suffered pain and scorn.



2.


There stands a stone, a rounded stone,
   ‚ÄôMidst ocean‚Äôs surges hoary,
On which sweet Jesus set his foot
   When mounting to his glory.

There grows a rose, a blooming rose,
   ‚ÄôMidst ocean‚Äôs briny waters,
That o‚Äôer may pass, to hear the mass,
   Havanah‚Äôs dusky daughters.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
