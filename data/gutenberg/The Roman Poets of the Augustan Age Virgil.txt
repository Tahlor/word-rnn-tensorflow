Any old pupil of yours, in finishing a work either of classical
scholarship or illustrative of ancient literature, must feel that he owes
to you, probably more than to any one else, the impulse which directed him
to these studies. It is with this feeling that I should wish to associate
your name with this volume. Many of your former pupils can confirm my
recollection that one of the happiest influences of our youth was the
admiration excited by the union, in your teaching, of perfect scholarship
with a true and generous appreciation of all that is excellent in
literature. The intimate friendship of many subsequent years has afforded
me, along with much else of still higher value, ample opportunities for
verifying these early impressions.
Ever affectionately yours,
This volume has been written in continuation of one which appeared some
years ago on the Roman Poets of the Republic. I hope in a short time to
bring out a new edition of that work, enlarged and corrected, and
afterwards to add another volume which will treat of Horace and the
Elegiac Poets. I have reserved for this later volume the examination of
the minor poems which have been attributed to Virgil, most of which belong
to the Augustan Age.
Besides the special acknowledgments of ideas or information derived from
various sources, which are made in notes at the foot of the page where an
occasion for them arises, I have to make a general acknowledgment of the
assistance I have received in my studies of the Augustan literature from
the earlier volumes of Dr. Merivale's 'History of the Romans under the
Empire,' from the 'History of Roman Literature' by W. S. Teuffel, from M.
Sainte-Beuve's 'Etude sur Virgile,' and from the Introductions and Notes
to Professor Conington's edition of Virgil, and Mr. Munro's edition of
Lucretius. In the account given of the Alexandrian literature in Chapter
I, I have availed myself of the chapters treating of that subject in
Helbig's 'Campanische Wandmalerei'; in treating of the estimation in which
Virgil was held under the Roman Empire, I have taken several references
from the work by Sr. Comparetti, 'Virgilio nel Medio Evo'; and in
examining the order in which the Eclogues were composed, I have adopted
the opinions expressed in Ribbeck's Prolegomena. I have also derived some
suggestions from the notes in the edition of Virgil by M. E. Benoist, and
from the work of M. G. Boissier, 'La Religion Romaine d'Auguste aux
Antonins.' As the greater part of this volume was written before the
appearance of Dr. Kennedy's Virgil, I have not been able to make so much
use of his notes as I should have wished: I have, however, profited by
them to correct or to illustrate statements made before I had seen his
work, and, in revising the Virgilian quotations for the press, I have
followed his text.
I did not read Mr. Nettleship's valuable and original 'Suggestions
Introductory to the Study of the Aeneid' until I had finished writing all
I had to say about that poem. I have drawn attention in the text or in
notes at the foot of the page to some places in which I modified what I
had originally written after reading his 'Suggestions,' to others in which
my own opinions are confirmed by his, and to one or two points of
divergence in our views.
Since the third chapter was printed off, I have received what seems a
confirmation of the opinion expressed there as to the probable situation
of Virgil's early home, from a friend who recently visited the district,
where I suppose it to have been. He writes of the country which he passed
through--'The result of my observations perfectly confirms what you had
already supposed. The country south of the Lago di Garda for a distance of
at least twenty miles is of a gently undulating character, and is
intersected by long ranges of hills which gradually sink down towards the
lake and the Mincio. The loftiest of these hills may perhaps reach a
height of 1000 feet above the lake-level, but that is a point on which I
cannot say anything certain.'
EDINBURGH, _Nov. 1876_.
The only material change which I have made in this edition is that I have
added translations of the passages quoted, for the convenience of any
readers, who, without much knowledge of Latin, may yet wish to learn
something about Latin literature. In the translations from Virgil, I have
sometimes made use of expressions which I found in Conington's prose
Translation and in Mr. Papillon's recently published edition of Virgil. I
have also availed myself of Sir Theodore Martin's Translation of the Odes
of Horace. In correcting or supplementing some statements made in the
on that edition which appeared shortly after its publication.

The Augustan Age, regarded as a critical epoch in the history of the
world, extends from the date of the battle of Actium, when Octavianus
became undisputed master of the world, to his death in the year 14 A.D.
But the age known by that name as a great epoch in the history of
literature begins some years earlier, and ends with the death of Livy and
Ovid in the third year of the following reign. Of the poets belonging to
that age whose writings have reached modern times--Virgil, Horace,
Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid--all were born, and some had reached
manhood, before the final overthrow of the Republic at the battle of
Philippi. The earlier poems of Virgil and Horace belong to the period
between that date and the establishment of the Empire. The age of the
Augustan poets may accordingly be regarded as extending from about the
death of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. to the death of Ovid 17 A.D.
The whole of this period was one of great literary activity, especially in
the department of poetry. Besides the writers just mentioned, several
others were recognised by their contemporaries as poets of high
excellence, though there is no reason to doubt that the works which have
reached our time were the most distinguished by original genius and
finished execution. These works, though differing much in spirit and
character as well as in value, have some common characteristics which mark
them off from the literature of the Republic. It seems remarkable, if we
consider the short interval which divides the Ciceronian from the Augustan
Age, and the enthusiasm with which poetry was cultivated by the younger
generation in the years immediately preceding the battle of Pharsalia,
that so few of the poets eminent in that generation lived on into the new
era. The insignificant name of Helvius Cinna is almost the only poetic
link between the age of Catullus and the age of Virgil.(1) Perhaps, also,
the Quintilius whose death Horace laments in the twenty-fourth Ode of Book
I. may be the Varus of the tenth poem of Catullus. The more famous name of
Asinius Pollio also connects the two eras; but in Catullus he is spoken
of, not as a poet, but simply as 'a youth of wit and graceful
accomplishments(2),' and in his later career he was more distinguished as
a soldier, statesman, and orator than as a poet(3). It is remarked by Mr.
Munro that there are indications that the new generation of poets would
have come into painful collision with those of the preceding generation
had their lives been prolonged(4). This spirit of hostility appears in the
somewhat contemptuous notice of Calvus and Catullus in the Satires of
Horace:--
Quos neque pulcher
Hermogenes unquam legit, neque simius iste
Nil praeter Calvum et doctus cantare Catullum(5).
But it is rather in their political feelings and relations, and in the
views of life arising out of these, than in the principles and practice of
their art, that the new poets are separated from, and antagonistic to, the
old. Had Calvus and Catullus survived the extinction of liberty, it would
have been impossible for them to have adopted the tone of the poets of the
following age. By birth, position, and all their associations and
sympathies, they belonged to the Senatorian party. If they could have
yielded an outward submission to the ascendency of Julius Caesar and
Augustus, they never could have become sincerely reconciled to the new
order of things, nor could they have employed their art to promote the
ideas of the Empire. On the other hand, L. Varius, the oldest among the
poets of the new era, seems first to have become famous by a poem on the
death of Julius Caesar. Virgil, in the poem placed first in order among
his acknowledged works, speaks of Octavianus in language which no poet of
the preceding generation could have applied to a living contemporary: 'O
Meliboeus, it was a God that gave to me this life of ease.' In the
Georgics, planned, and, for the most part, composed before the
establishment of the monarchy, the person of Caesar is introduced, not
only as the centre of power in the world, but as an object of religious
veneration; and the national and ethical teaching of that poem is entirely
in harmony with the objects of his policy. And, although Horace in the
Satires and Epodes, composed between the years 40 and 30 B.C., is so far
true to the cause of his youth as to abstain from any direct declaration
of adherence to the winning side, yet he attributes to his adviser
Trebatius the counsel 'to celebrate the exploits of the invincible
Caesar(6);' and his whole relation to Maecenas is one of the most
characteristic marks of the position in which the new literature stood to
the State and to its leading men.
Yet, while separated from the literature of the Republic in many of its
ideas, and in the personal and political feelings on which it is founded,
the poetry of the Augustan Age is, in form and execution, the mature
development of the efforts of the previous centuries. Much of its literary
inspiration is derived from the age immediately preceding it, and from
still older native sources. The thought of Lucretius acted upon the mind
of Virgil through the force both of sympathy and antagonism, as a strong
original nature acts upon one which is at once receptive of influence and
possessed of firm convictions of its own. The national sentiment of Ennius
and the censorious spirit of Lucilius reappeared in new forms in the
Augustan poetry; while the more humane and social feelings, and the
enjoyment of beauty in Nature and art, fostered by Greek studies, as well
as the taste for less elevated pleasures, stimulated by the life of a
luxurious capital, are elements which the poetry of the early Empire has
in common with that of the last years of the Republic.
But the poetry of the new era has also certain marked characteristics, the
result not so much of antecedent as of concomitant circumstances, which
proclaim its affinity with great literary epochs of other nations rather
than with any period of the national literature. By Voltaire the Augustan
Age at Rome is ranked with the Age of Pericles at Athens, that of Lorenzo
de Medici at Florence, and that of Louis XIV. in France, as one of four
epochs in which arts and letters attained their highest perfection. The
affinity between the Augustan Age and those of Pericles and Lorenzo is
more superficial than real. They were all indeed periods in which the
cultivation of the arts to the highest degree of perfection was fostered
by the enlightened patronage of the eminent men who have given their name
to their eras. But the position of Augustus, as an absolute ruler, acted
more directly and potently, as a modifying and restraining power, on the
thoughts and feelings expressed in his age, than that of the leading men
of a republic; and the unique position of Rome as the mistress and
lawgiver of the civilised world gives to the literature of the Augustan
Age an imperial character and interest, which the national literature of
no other city or country, even though superior in other respects, can
possess. Those who regard all Latin poetry as exotic and imitative have,
with some plausibility, attempted to establish a parallel between the
Alexandrine poetry of the third century B.C. and that of the Augustan Age.
Nor can it be denied that the relation of the Augustan poets to the
Emperor was somewhat parallel to that of the scholars and poets of
Alexandria to the Ptolemies. The Alexandrine science and literature were
also important factors in Roman culture; and the most eminent poets both
of the Augustan Age and of that immediately preceding it, with the
exception of Horace and Lucretius, acknowledged, in the form as well as
the materials of their art, the influence of this latest development of
Greek poetry. The nature and amount of the debt incurred to the learned
school of Alexandria will be considered later, and it will be seen that it
does not seriously affect the originality of the best Roman writers. The
age of Queen Anne and of the first George, again, has been called the
Augustan Age of English literature. The parallel between the two eras
consists in the relation which poets and writers held to men eminent in
the State, and also in the finished execution and moderation of tone
common to both. The writers of England in our Augustan Age had the
advantage over those of Rome in the freedom with which they could express
their thoughts; but, even with this advantage, and with the still greater
advantage that the English race, in the long course of its literary
annals, has given proof of a richer poetical faculty than any other race
except the Hellenic, the blindest national partiality would scarcely claim
as general and as durable an interest for any poetical work of that era as
that claimed for the Georgics and Aeneid of Virgil and for the Odes and
Epistles of Horace.
On the whole the closest parallel, in respect not so much of the substance
and form of composition as of the circumstances and conditions affecting
the lives and tastes of poets and men of letters, is to be sought in the
age of Louis XIV. of France. The position and the policy of Augustus and
of Louis XIV. were alike in some important features. As absolute rulers,
the one over a great empire, the other over the most powerful and
enlightened nation then existing, they each played the most prominent part
in history during more than half a century. They were each animated by a
strong passion for national and personal glory, and encouraged art and
literature, not merely as a source of refined pleasure congenial to their
own tastes, but as the chief ornament of their reigns, and as important
instruments of their policy.
And not only the political but the purely literary conditions of the two
epochs were in some respects parallel. They were both times, not of
growth, but of maturity; not so much of the spontaneous inspiration of
genius, as of systematic effort directed in accordance with the principles
of art and the careful study of ancient models. In each time circumstances
and mutual sympathies brought men of letters into close and familiar
contact both with one another and with men of affairs and of social
eminence. And, while the relation of patronage to literature is not in any
circumstances favourable to original invention, and though, except under
most advantageous conditions, its tendency is to produce a tameness of
spirit, or even an insincerity of tone, yet it has its compensating
advantages. It imparts to literature the tone of the world--of the world
not only of social eminence, but of practical experience and conversance
with great affairs. The good taste, judgment, and moderation of tone which
have enabled the Augustan literature to stand successfully the criticism
of nineteen centuries, as well as its deficiency in the highest creative
power, when compared with such eras as the Homeric Age, the Age of
Pericles, and the Elizabethan Age in England, mark the limits of the good
influence which this relation between the great in worldly station and the
great in genius can exercise on literature.
A further parallel might be drawn between the material conditions of the
Augustan Age and those of the Age of Louis XIV. The aspect which the world
they lived in presented to the writers of the two eras was that of a rich,
luxurious, pleasure-loving city, the capital of a great empire or kingdom.
And this aspect of the world acts upon the susceptible nature of the poet
with both an attractive and a repellent force. He may feel the spell of
outward pomp and magnificence and the attractions of pleasure; or he may
be driven back on his own thought, and into communion with Nature, and to
an ideal longing for simpler and purer conditions.
But, instead of tracing these resemblances further, it is more important
to observe that, though the outward influences acting upon the poets of
the two eras were in many respects parallel, yet in form and substance the
poetry of the Augustan Age is quite different from that of the Age of
Louis XIV. However striking the parallel between any two periods of
history may at first sight appear, the points of difference between them
must be much more numerous than those of agreement: and, though outward
conditions have a modifying influence upon national temperament and
individual genius, yet these last are much the most important factors in
the creative literature of any age. The genius of ancient Italy was, in
point of imaginative susceptibility, very different from that of modern
France; and, though his countrymen recognise in Racine a moral affinity
with Virgil, yet the works these poets have left to the world are as
different as they well can be, in form, purpose, and character. The
conditions indicated in the comparison between the two periods are to be
studied as modifying, not as productive, influences. The forms which the
highest spiritual life in an age or an individual assumes, the power of
free and happy development which it obtains, or the limitations to which
it has to submit, can, to a very considerable extent, be explained by
reference, in the case of nations, to the political, social, and material
circumstances of the age, and, in the case of the individual, to his early
life and environment, his education and personal fortunes. But the quality
and intensity of that spiritual force which manifests itself from time to
time in the world, giving a new impulse to thought, a new direction to
feeling, and a new delight to life, are not to be explained by any
combination of circumstances. Yet, just as it is desirable to realise all
that can be known of the life and fortunes of an individual poet before
endeavouring to extract from his various works the secret of his power and
charm, so it is desirable, before entering on a separate study of the
various books which constitute the literature of any age, to take a
general survey of the most important conditions affecting the lives,
thoughts, and art of all who lived and wrote in that age. In the Augustan
Age these conditions may be classified under four heads: (1) the political
circumstances of the Empire and the state of moral and religious feeling
resulting from them; (2) the social relation of men of letters to men
eminent in the State; (3) the wealth, luxury, and outward splendour which
met the eye and gratified the senses, in the great city itself, and in the
villas scattered over the shores and inland scenes of central Italy; (4)
the intellectual culture inherited from the preceding age and modified by
the tastes and conditions of the new generation. These will be reviewed as
conditions acting on the imagination, and forming the intellectual
atmosphere in the midst of which the productions of poetical genius
expanded into various shapes and dimensions of beauty and stateliness.
The battle of Actium marked the end of a century of revolution, civil
disturbances and wars, of confiscations of property, proscriptions and
massacres, such as no civilised state had ever witnessed before. The
triumph of Augustus secured internal peace and order for a century. The
whole world was, as Tacitus says(7), exhausted, and gladly consented to
the establishment of the Empire in the interests of peace. The generation
to which Virgil, Horace, Tibullus, and Propertius belonged had passed
through one of the worst crises of this long period of suffering. The
victors of Philippi, so far from following the example of clemency set to
them by the great victor of Pharsalia, had emulated the worst excesses of
the times of Marius and Sulla(8). The poets whose works record the various
phases of feeling through which that age passed had in their own person
experienced the consequences of the general insecurity. Virgil, in
addition to the loss of his paternal farm, had incurred imminent danger
from the violence of the soldier to whom his land had been allotted. The
language of Horace indicates that his life had been more than once in
jeopardy--at the rout of Philippi, and in his subsequent wanderings by land
and sea(9)--till he found himself a needy adventurer, 'humilem decisis
pennis,' again at Rome. Tibullus lost the greater part of the estates
which his ancestors had enjoyed for generations(10). A similar calamity
befell Propertius(11). Their own experience must thus have deepened the
horror of prolonged war and bloodshed natural to men of humane and
unwarlike temper, as they all were; for Horace, who alone among them took
part in the civil war, describes himself, a few years later, as 'weak and
unfit for war(12),' and Tibullus pleads his effeminacy and timidity as a
justification of a life devoted to indolent enjoyment(13). The works of
that age, composed between the dates of the battles of Philippi and
Actium, express the deep longing of the world for rest: those written
later express the deep thankfulness for its attainment. In Virgil the
recoil from the cruel and violent passions of the time in which his early
manhood was cast draws forth his tender compassion for all human
suffering, and creates in his imagination the ideal of a life of
peace--'far from the clash of arms,' the vision of a place of rest after
toil and danger--'where the fates hold out to us peaceful dwelling-places;'
just as the recoil from the political anarchy of his own age and from the
cruel memories of the Marian times deepens the sense of human misery in
Lucretius, and forces on his mind the ideal refuge from the storms of life
in 'the high and serene temples well bulwarked by the learning of the
wise.' In Horace the feeling of insecurity arising out of his early
experience confirms the lessons of Epicurean wisdom, and teaches him not
to expect too much from life, but to enjoy thankfully whatever good the
passing hour brought to him. In all of them the sense of the real miseries
from which the world had escaped, and of the real blessings which it
enjoyed after the battle of Actium, induces an acquiescence in the
extinction of liberty and in the establishment of a form of government
which had been for centuries most repugnant to Roman sentiment.
Another influence reconciling men to the great political change which took
place in that era was the restored sense of national union. With whatever
feelings Octavianus may have been regarded in the early years of the
Triumvirate, after the final departure of Antony from Rome he was looked
upon both as the main pillar of order and as the champion of the national
cause, the true representative of Italy, of the 'Senatus Populusque
Romanus' against the motley hosts of the East, arrayed under the standards
of Antony and his Egyptian queen:--
Hinc Augustus agens Italos in proelia Caesar
Cum Patribus Populoque, Penatibus et magnis Dis.
Hinc ope barbarica variisque Antonius armis,
Victor ab Aurorae populis et litore rubro,
Aegyptum viresque Orientis et ultima secum
Bactra vehit, sequiturque, nefas, Aegyptia coniunx(14).
With the Romans in the later age of the Republic the feeling of the glory
and greatness, the ancient and unbroken tradition, of their State was a
more active sentiment than the love of political liberty. The care for the
'Respublica Romana' as a free commonwealth was in the last century of its
existence confined to the leaders of the Senatorian aristocracy; the pride
in the 'Imperium Romanum' was a feeling in which all classes could share,
and which could especially unite to Rome the people of Italy, who had been
admitted too late into citizenship, and were separated by too great a
distance from the capital, to make the exercise of the political franchise
an object of value in their eyes. They probably felt themselves more truly
in the position of equal citizenship after the establishment of the
monarchy than before it. This feeling of the pride of empire asserts
itself much more strongly in the poets of the Augustan Age than in the
writers of the preceding generation. It is scarcely, if at all, apparent
in Lucretius and Catullus. It is only in the idealising oratory of Cicero,
who, with all his devoted attachment to the forms of the constitution and
the traditions of political freedom, still had a strong sympathy with the
imperial spirit of Rome, that we find the expression of the same kind of
sentiment which suggested to Virgil such lines as
Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento(15),
and inspired the national Odes of Horace.
The majesty of the State, moreover, impressed the imagination more
immediately and more deeply when it was visibly and permanently embodied
in a single person than when the administration of affairs and the
government of the Provinces were distributed for a brief tenure of office
among many competitors. By enabling them to realise the unity and vast
extent of their dominion, Augustus reconciled the prouder spirits of his
countrymen to his rule, as by restoring peace, order, and material
prosperity he enlisted their interests in his favour. At the same time the
success of his arms over the still unsubdued tribes of the West, and of
his diplomacy in wiping out the stain left on the Roman standards by the
disastrous campaign of Crassus, continued to gratify the passion for
military glory, without endangering the security and prosperity of Italy.
The national sentiment of Rome was further gratified by the maintenance of
the old forms of the constitution, by the revival of ancient usages and
ceremonies, and by the creation of a new interest in the early traditions
of the city, and in the 'manners and men of the olden time(16).' In his
brief summary of the glories of the Augustan Age, Horace specifies this
return to the ancient ways, 'by which the Latin name and the might of
Italy grew great,' as one of the best results of Caesar's administration.
The revolution effected in the first century before our era, so far from
seeking, as other revolutions have done, abruptly to sever the connexion
between the old and the new, strove to re-establish the continuity of
national existence. The Augustan Age impressed itself on the minds of
those living under it as an era not of destruction but of restoration.
Though in the early part of his career Augustus availed himself of the
revolutionary passions of his time to overthrow the Senatorian oligarchy,
yet he sought to establish his own power on the conservative instincts of
society, and especially on the religious traditions intimately connected
with these instincts(17). The powerful hold which these instincts and the
feeling of the vital relation subsisting between the past and the present
had on the Roman nature was the secret of the great stability of the
Republic and Empire. We shall find how largely this sentiment enters into
the poetry of the age, how it is especially the animating principle of the
great national Epic, as it was of the national commemorative poem of
Ennius.
But the age witnessed a restoration of the past, not only in its action on
the imagination, but in a more direct influence on opinion and conduct.
Horace says of it, in the same passage as that referred to above,--'It put
a curb on licence violating all the rules of order, and caused ancient
sins to disappear.' The licence of the previous age in speculation, as in
life, had provoked a moral and religious reaction. The idea of a return to
a simpler and better life, and of a revived faith in the gods and in the
forms and ceremonies of religion, existed at least as an aspiration, if it
did not bear much fruit in action. This ideal aspiration finds its
expression not only in the two great poems of Virgil, whose whole nature
was in thorough harmony with it, who may be regarded almost as the prophet
of a new and purer religion, but in many of the Odes of the sceptical
disciple of Aristippus. It was part of the policy of Augustus, whether
from sincere conviction or as an instrument of social and political
regeneration, to revive religion and morality. Among the great acts of his
reign commemorated by himself he especially mentions the building and
restoration of the temples(18). The 'Julian laws' aimed also at a social
and moral restoration. There is no ground for attributing any hypocrisy to
Augustus, as a legislator, or to Horace, as his panegyrist, though neither
the life of the Emperor nor that of the poet showed a strict conformity
with the object of these laws. Yet, if it failed to re-establish the
ancient faith in the minds of the educated classes and to restore a
primitive austerity of life, this revival affected the best literature of
the time by the influence which it exercised on the deeper and more
serious feeling of Virgil and the manlier sympathies of Horace, and by
imposing at least some restraint on Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid in the
record of their pleasures(19).
The poets with whom our enquiry is concerned, and especially the two most
illustrious of their number, thoroughly represent, as they helped to call
forth, the spirit in which the Roman world passed through the great change
from the Republic to the Empire. They give expression to the weariness and
longing for rest, to the revival of Roman and Italian feeling, to the
pride of empire, the charm of ancient memories and associations, the
aspiration after a better life and a firmer faith. But, further, the
expression of these feelings is made subordinate to the personal glory of
Augustus, who stands out as the central and commanding figure in all their
representations. He is celebrated as the restorer of the golden Saturnian
age(20); the closer of the gateway of Janus(21); the leader of the men and
the gods of Italy against the swarms of the East and her monstrous
divinities(22); the 'father of his country(23);' the ruler destined to
extend the empire, on which 'the sun never set,' 'beyond the Garamantians
and Indians(24);' the descendant and true representative of the mythical
author of the Roman State(25); the man in whom the great destiny of Rome
and the great labours of all her sons were summed up and fulfilled(26);
the conqueror who raised three hundred shrines to the gods of Italy(27);
the legislator who by his life and his laws had reformed the corrupt
manners of the State(28). The sense of gratitude for the rest and
prosperity enjoyed under Augustus, the admiration for the real power of
intellect and character which made him the most successful ruler that the
world has ever seen, the confidence in the unbroken good fortune which
marked all his earlier career, may account, without the necessity of
attributing any unworthy motive, for the eulogies bestowed upon him as a
ruler and organiser of empire. But the language of admiration goes beyond
these into a region in which modern sympathies can with difficulty follow
it. Modern criticism may partially explain, but it cannot enable us to
enter with sympathy into that peculiar phase of the latter days of
Paganism which first appears in the literature and the historical
monuments of the Augustan Age as the Deification of the Emperors. In the
pages of Tacitus the worship of the Emperor appears as an established
'cultus,' as the symbol and the instrument of Roman domination over
foreign nations(29). The cities of Spain vie with the cities of the
Asiatic Greeks in their desire to raise temples in honour of the living
Emperor. Tacitus seems to regard it as even something discreditable in
Tiberius that he disclaims divine attributes(30). The origin of this
'cultus,' as it first established itself in the Greek cities of Asia, may
be referred to a survival of the old Greek hero-worship, which led even in
the Republican times to the offering of divine honours to Roman Proconsuls
and to the excess of the monarchical sentiment among Asiatics, which had
led to the worship of the successors of Alexander, and had prompted
Alexander himself to claim a divine origin. This foreign vein of feeling
united with a native vein,--the strong Roman faith in a secret invisible
power watching over the destiny of the State, and revered as 'Fortuna
Urbis.' This secret invisible divinity became as it were incarnate in the
person of the supreme ruler of the world, wielding the whole power,
representing the whole majesty of Rome.
The feeling with which the contemporary poets attribute to Augustus a
divine function in the world, and anticipate for him a place and high
office among the gods after death, is something different from this
literal adoration of a living man as invested with the full power and
attributes of Deity. But it is difficult to find any rational explanation
of the tone adopted by them in such passages as Georg. i. 24-42, or
Horace, Ode iii. 3. 11-12. There is, however, a striking coincidence in
the manner in which Virgil and Horace suggest the blending of the mortal
with the immortal, which seems to imply a common source of inspiration.
Horace asserts the divinity of Augustus by claiming for him qualities and
services equal to, or greater than, those which raised Castor, Pollux,
Hercules, Bacchus, and Romulus to the dwelling-place of the gods(31).
Virgil, in one of the cardinal passages of the Aeneid, in which the action
is projected into his own age, claims, for the restorer of order then, a
vaster range of beneficent influence than that over which the civilising
labours and conquests of Bacchus and Hercules had extended(32). In another
passage Horace speaks of the Roman as worshipping the 'numen' of Caesar
along with the Lares, 'even as Greece keeps Castor and mighty Hercules in
memory(33).' In all these passages the idea implied is that, as great
services to the human race have in other times raised mortals from earth
to heaven, so it shall be with Augustus after the beneficent labours of
his life are over(34). Probably the earliest suggestion of the idea in its
manifestation at Rome came from the consecration of Julius Caesar after
his death. The 'Iulium Sidus'--'the star beneath which the harvest-fields
should be glad with corn'--is appealed to both by Virgil and Horace as a
witness of the mortal become immortal. As the office of the deified Julius
is to answer the prayers of the husbandman, such too will be the office of
Augustus; and it is in this relation that he is invoked in the first
Georgic among the deities whose function it is to watch over the fields.
Both poets recall also the divine origin of the Emperor,--'Augustus Caesar,
of the race of heaven,'--as the descendant of Venus. Both too dwell on the
especial protection of which he was the object. The divine care which had
watched over Rome from its origin was now centred on him as the supreme
head of the State, the heir and adopted son of the great Julius.
But, although we cannot ascribe to Virgil and Horace the ignorant
superstition which raised temples to the living Emperor in the cities of
Asia and in the various provinces of the Empire, it is difficult to
extract from their language any germ of sincere conviction. And yet to
condemn them of a base servility and hypocrisy would be to judge them
altogether from a modern point of view. At such a time as the Augustan Age
the minds of men were very variously affected by the different modes of
religious belief, national and foreign, philosophical and artistic, which
had been inherited from the past.(35) It must have been difficult for any
one to be altogether unmoved by the innumerable symbols of religion
visible around him, suggestive of a constant and immediate action of a
supernatural power on all human, and especially all national, concerns:
and it must have been equally difficult for any one trained in Greek
philosophy to accept literally the incongruous fables of mythology, or to
attach a definite personality to the imaginary beings of which it was
composed. Horace and Virgil appear to stand at opposite extremes of
incredulity and faith. Horace, in his Odes, accepts the beings of the
Greek mythology as materials for his art, while, by his silence on the
subject in his Satires and Epistles, he clearly implies that this
acceptance formed no part of his real convictions. To Virgil, on the other
hand, the gods of mythology appear to have a real existence, as
manifestations of the divine energy, revealed in the religious traditions
which connect the actual world of experience with a supernatural origin.
So too Horace, in his Odes, treats the blending of the divine with the
human elements in Augustus artistically or symbolically--represents him as
drinking nectar between Pollux and Hercules, or as inspired with wisdom by
the Muses in a Pierian cave--in much the same spirit as the great painters
of the Renaissance introduced in their pictures living popes or patrons of
art into the company of the most sacred personages. Virgil, to whose mind,
in all things affecting either the State or the individual, the invisible
world of faith appears very near the actual world of experience, seems
sincerely to believe in the delegation of supernatural power and authority
on the Emperor, and in the favour of Heaven watching over him. The divine
energy diffused through all living things might appear to be united with
the human elements in Augustus as it was in no other man, so that while
still on earth he might be thought of, if not as a 'praesens divus,' yet
as acting 'praesenti numine,' as the representative and vicegerent of
omnipotence(36).
Some further light is thrown on this subject by considering the
manifestation of this same spirit in other forms of the art of that age.
The famous statue of the Emperor, found recently in the ruins of a villa
of the Empress Livia, and at present seen among the statues of the
_Braccio Nuovo_ in the Vatican, has been critically examined by an eminent
German scholar, as furnishing the best commentary on the language of the
Augustan poets. In this statue the Emperor appears as blending the
attributes of a Roman imperator with those of a Greek hero or demigod.(37)
Beside him a Cupid, symbolical of the Julian descent from Venus, appears
riding on a dolphin. The breast-plate represents, among other protecting
deities, those whom Horace addresses in the Carmen Saeculare, Phoebus and
Diana, and the Sun and Earth-goddess. In the centre there is a figure of
Mars attended by the wolf, receiving back the standards from the Parthian;
on either side are seen two figures, representative of races recently
conquered, probably the Celtiberians and the tribes of the Alps. From the
coincidence of its symbolism it may be inferred that the statue was
produced at the same time as the Carmen Saeculare was composed. Its object
is to impress on the minds of men the image of Augustus as at once a great
earthly conqueror and a being of divine descent and possessed of more than
mortal attributes: the especial object of care to the supreme God of
Heaven; to Apollo, whom, since the victory of Actium, he claimed as his
tutelary divinity; to the Earth-goddess, the giver of fruitfulness and
prosperity; to Mars, the second divine ancestor of the Roman race, in
whose honour the famous temple, of which the ruins are yet visible, had
been raised after the battle of Philippi. The statue is of Greek
workmanship; the Greek divinities are presented in the forms familiar to
Greek art; but the idea is purely Roman, and born of the immediate
circumstances of the age.
Other extant works of art illustrate the divine functions and attributes
claimed for Augustus. In one cameo he is seen throned beside the goddess
Roma, with the sceptre and lituus, symbolical of his secular and spiritual
function, and the eagle of Jupiter at his side. In others both the Emperor
himself and various members of his family are represented under the form
of gods, goddesses, and demigods. Thus, in one in which the figure of
Aeneas is introduced, the young C. Caesar (Caligula) appears as Cupid, and
in another Germanicus and Agrippina are represented as Triptolemus and
Ceres.(38) But still more important, as attesting not the idealising
fancies of contemporary Greeks, but the native feeling with which the
house of Caesar came to be regarded even in the early years of the Empire,
is the one great extant monument of that age, a monument of Roman
inspiration and Roman workmanship, the Pantheon, raised by Agrippa in
honour of the deities connected with the Julian race.
The prominence given to this representation of Augustus in the poetry and
in the art of his age is probably to be explained by his own character and
policy. He was animated in no ordinary degree by that love of fame and
distinction which very powerfully influenced the greatest Roman conquerors
and statesmen, orators and poets. The disdain of such distinctions and the
dislike of public spectacles are mentioned, in contrast to the tastes of
his predecessor, among the causes of the unpopularity of Tiberius. The
enumeration in the Ancyraean inscription of the honours and titles
bestowed on him, recorded with 'imperial brevity' and dictated by a proud
self-esteem, attests the strength of this ruling passion in the latter
years of the life of Augustus. The direct pressure which he brought to
bear on the most eminent poets of the time to celebrate his wars is
sufficiently indicated in many passages in the Odes and familiar writings
of Horace. Belonging by descent to the comparatively obscure families of
the Octavii and Atii, Augustus attached peculiar importance to the glories
of the Julian line, which he inherited through his great-uncle and
adoptive father. Even Julius Caesar, notwithstanding his Epicurean
disregard of the religious ideas of his age, had encouraged the belief in
his divine descent, as marking him out for the special favours of fortune.
There was moreover in Augustus, in contradistinction to Julius Caesar, a
strong vein of religious or superstitious sentiment. His personal courage
has been questioned, probably with injustice, but he appears to have been
in a marked degree liable to supernatural terrors(39). As happens not
unfrequently with men who have been invariably successful in great and
hazardous enterprises, along with a strong reliance in the resources of
his own mind, he seems to have had faith in a supernatural guidance and
assistance attending him. His politic understanding appreciated the use of
such a belief to secure a divine sanction for his rule, which rested
substantially on military force. He availed himself of the enthusiasm and
willing services of the poets of the age, who regarded him as at once the
saviour of the State and their own benefactor, to impress this idea of
himself on the imagination of the cultivated classes, and at the same time
to glorify the actual successes of his reign, to further his policy of
national regeneration, and to make men feel the security of a
divinely-appointed government, along with the pride of belonging to a
powerful imperial State.
The political revolution which transformed the Republic into the Empire,
and the state of public feeling, which, arising spontaneously, yet
received direction from the will and policy of Augustus, thus appear to be
the most important conditions determining the character of the Augustan
literature, and distinguishing it from that of the previous age. Poetic
art was employed as it had never been in any former time as an instrument
of government. If anything could have made the new order of things
acceptable to the best representatives of the old Republican traditions,
the purity and elevation imparted to the idea of the Empire in the verse
of Virgil must have had this effect. The poetical imagination, susceptible
