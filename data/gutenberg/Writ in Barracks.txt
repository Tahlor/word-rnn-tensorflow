                                 *WAR*


    I

    A tent that is pitched at the base:
      A wagon that comes from the night:
    A stretcherâ€”and on it a Case:
      A surgeon, whoâ€™s holding a light.
    The Infantryâ€™s bearing the bruntâ€”
      O hark to the wind-carried cheer!
    A mutter of guns at the front:
      A whimper of sobs at the rear.
    And itâ€™s _War_!  â€™Orderly, hold the light.
      You can lay him down on the table: so.
    Easilyâ€”gently!  Thanksâ€”you may go.â€™
      And itâ€™s War! but the part that is not for show.

    II

    A tent, with a table athwart,
      A table thatâ€™s laid out for one;
    A waterproof coverâ€”and nought
      But the limp, mangled work of a gun.
    A bottle thatâ€™s stuck by the pole,
      A guttering dip in its neck;
    The flickering light of a soul
      On the wondering eyes of The Wreck,
    And itâ€™s _War_!  â€™Orderly, hold his hand.
      Iâ€™m not going to hurt you, so donâ€™t be afraid.
    A ricochet!  God! what a mess it has made!â€™
      And itâ€™s _War_! and a very unhealthy trade.

    III

    The clink of a stopper and glass:
      A sigh as the chloroform drips:
    A trickle ofâ€”what? on the grass,
      And bluer and bluer the lips.
    The lashes have hidden the stare....
      A rent, and the clothes fall away....
    A touch, and the wound is laid bare....
      A cut, and the face has turned grey....
    And itâ€™s _War_!  â€™Orderly, take It out.
      Itâ€™s hard for his child, and itâ€™s rough on his wife,
    There might have beenâ€”soonerâ€”a chance for his life.
      But itâ€™s _War_!  Andâ€”Orderly, clean this knife!â€™




                             *ARMY DOCTOR*


    Army Doctor!  Army Doctor!
    â€™Ereâ€™s some â€™cruities for inspection,â€”
    Some in rags, anâ€™ some in cuffs.
    Some in shirts, anâ€™ some without â€™em,
    Wot a blessed strange collection!
    Served before?  You neednâ€™t doubt â€™em,
      Bloominâ€™ muffs!

    Army Doctor!  Army Doctor!
    Take your sword, anâ€™ drop your lancet,
    Teach your nurses â€™ow to fight!
    â€™Ow to march the dead marchâ€”solemn!
    â€™Ow to route marchâ€”anâ€™ to dance it!
    Teach â€™em â€™ow to march in column,
      By the right!

    Army Doctor!  Army Doctor!
    Gold anâ€™ velvet! â€™broidered lacinâ€™s,
    â€™Oldinâ€™ â€™igh your bloominâ€™ â€™ead!
    â€™Seen you peel that coat so winninâ€™,
    â€™Seen you stain them pretty facinâ€™s,
    â€™Seen your â€™ighly glossy linen,
      Splattered red!

    Army Doctor!  Army Doctor!
    â€™Sun is â€™otâ€”anâ€™ we are learninâ€™
    Lessons in the cholera school,
    Weâ€™re fear-sick, anâ€™ mad as â€™atters,
    Throat a-parchinâ€™, â€™ead a-burninâ€™,
    Seems to me, _youâ€™re_ takinâ€™ matters
      Rather cool!

    Army Doctor!  Army Doctor!
    Spurs and swagger!  Cuff anâ€™ collar!
    Up to evâ€™ry bloominâ€™ trick!
    â€™Seen youâ€”as Iâ€™ve seen none otherâ€”
    Go toâ€”where _I_ dursnâ€™t foller!
    â€™Seen you act the man and brother
      To the sick!

    Army Doctor!  Army Doctor!
    Things by Engineers forgotten,
    _You_ â€™ave got to recollect.
    Thoâ€™ youâ€™re such a gilded dandy,
    When the meat is goinâ€™ rotten,
    Chances are, _youâ€™re_ somewhere â€™andy
      To inspect!

    Army Doctor!  Army Doctor!
    Where the firinâ€™ never ceases,
    Where the â€™uddled soldier lies,
    Where the Mauser bullets shave â€™im,
    Gawd! theyâ€™re chippinâ€™ â€™im to pieces!
    Git â€™im out of fire anâ€™ save â€™im....
      _Well done, Guys!_




                           *NICHOLSONâ€™S NEK*


    _They gave their best at Waterloo,_
    _For the honour of Englandâ€™s name;_
    _They threw their best on a hundred fields,_
    _To put our foes to shame._
    _â€™Tis good that Englandâ€™s soldier men_
    _To-day can do the same._

    They have proved their worth,
    To the ends of the earth.
      They have striven and won,â€”and failed!
    They have shown their might,
    On the Dargai Height,
      When the _mollahâ€™s_ bullets hailed.

    They have laid their dead,
    In the river bed,
      On the site of their last brave stand.
    They have buried at night,
    By a lantern light,
      In a grave that they scooped in the sand.

    And far and wide,
    They have done and died,
      By donga, and veldt, and kloof.
    And the lonely grave,
    Of the honoured brave,
      Is a proofâ€”if we need a proof,
    They wonâ€”and died,
    And we glorified
      The men of the barrack schools.
    They diedâ€”and failed,
    And in wrath we railed
      At the fault of the bungling fools!

    And perhaps it is good
    That we change our mood,
      And perchance it is well to blame,
    And to seek elsewhere,
    For some men to bear,
      The weight of our foolish shame.
    But the fight hard fought,
    Must it go for nought
      Because of its hapless turn?
    Must we then withhold,
    For the life hard sold,
      The Honour it died to earn?

    When hot and tired,
    With the last round fired,
      And never a ray of hopeâ€”
    What then the shame?
    They were just the same
      Who charged Talanaâ€™s slope!
    You may give and take,
    As the shrapnels rake,
      When your battâ€™ry has replied;
    But you cannot live
    When thereâ€™s too much give,
      From the guns on the open side.

    Good men are they,
    Who gain the day,â€”
      And victory is sweet,â€”
    And just as brave
    Who do not rave
      At every small defeat.
    For the fight hard fought
    Must not go for nought,
      Because of its hapless turn;
    Nor we withhold,
    For the life hard sold,
      The Honour it died to earn.

    _We gave our best at Waterloo,_
    _For the honour of Englandâ€™s name;_
    _We threw our best on a hundred fields_
    _To put our foes to shame._
    _â€™Tis good that Englandâ€™s soldier men_
    _To-day can do the same._




                           *MY PAL, THE BOER*


    We met without appointment on an â€™ill,
    I comed upon the beggar without warninâ€™;
      Layinâ€™ down beâ€™ind a boulder,
      With â€™is rifle to â€™is shoulder,
    He sent along wotâ€™s Dutch for a â€™Good-morninâ€™.â€™
    â€™E missed me with a fair amount of skill,
    Anâ€™ â€™fore â€™eâ€™d time to mount, anâ€™ get from danger,
      I was takinâ€™ of my rest,
      By a sittinâ€™ on â€™is chest,
    Anâ€™ a sayinâ€™ to the welcome little stranger:â€”

    â€™My pal, the Boer!
    Youâ€™re a prisoner of warâ€™
    (â€™E tried to break my jaw, but thatâ€™s a trifle);
        â€™You canâ€™t escape me, can yer?
      In the name of Rule Britannia,
    I commandeer your â€™orse anâ€™ Mauser rifle!â€™

    You wouldnâ€™t call â€™is manners over bright,
    Anâ€™ you wouldnâ€™t term â€™is disposition sunny,
      Anâ€™ â€™e â€™ad a silly notion
      That the cause of the commotion
    Was Chamberlain a-fightinâ€™ for â€™is money;
    Anâ€™ â€™e fancied that the British flag was whiteâ€”
    â€™Twas a silly fancyâ€”still we must excuse it,
      When the Lancers came along
      â€™E felt a trifle _bong_!
    â€™E soon found out the proper way to use it!

    My pal, the Boer,
    Ainâ€™t used to proper war,
    But thoâ€™ â€™e scorns the flag anâ€™ does the grandy,
      The â€™igh anâ€™ mighty scorner,
      When we get â€™im in a corner,
    â€™E FINDS A FLAG OF TRUCE IS MIGHTY â€™ANDY!




                   *SONG OF THE FIRST TRAIN THROUGH*


    Line Clear to Witteputs!  I wind around the guarded hill,
    And thunder oâ€™er the lean long bridge that spans the sombre
            stream;
    No uptorn rail to devastate, no culvert gap to fill,
    And where the outpost feared to ride, I gather up my steam.

    (_I passed a little mound of earth that bore the crossâ€™s sign,â€”_
    _A Colonel, and a dozen men, who fell to clear the line._)

    Line Clear to Belmont: and I feel the ballast shaking down:
    My flanges bite the new-laid rail and prove the new-thrust pin.
    On either side the purple ridge, the veldt land sickly brown,
    The â€™distant offâ€™ says â€™Welcome,â€™ and the â€™Homeâ€™ says â€™Come ye
            in.â€™

    (_Two thousand guardsmen rushed the Kopâ€”a score are buried
            here,_
    _And here are laid some Fusiliersâ€”they fell to give Line
            Clear._)

    Line Clear to Graspan: so I run adown the gentle grade,
    Nor notice in my joyful haste the kopje stubble grown,
    And wildly bouldered foot to crest where fell a half brigade,
    What time the bristling mountain-side with segment shell was
            sown.

    (_The mess-deck and the ward-room thinned to give the line
            pratique_
    _Line Clear from Graspanâ€”so, half-mast the Ensign at the Peak._)

    Line Clear: along the new-spliced wires that droop from pole to
            pole,
    By Enslin, where the helio glared fitfully and fleet,
    The word is passed across the plain to where the rivers roll,â€”
    To where, tree-fringed in eddying swirls, the Modder meets the
            Riet.

    (_In heat and thirst and weariness a hundred dying lay,_
    _A hundred bloody forms grew stiff to give me Right Away._)

    Line Clear: I face the grim gaunt range that stretches east and
            west
    (â€™Twas by its base, near Magers farm, that Wauchopeâ€™s men went
            down):
    I skirt the ridge that hid the guns, and gleefully I breast
    The easy rise that brings in view the long-beleaguered town.

    (_Line Clear: oâ€™er blood, and sweat, and pain, and sorrowâ€™s_
      _road I ran,_
    _And every sleeper was a wound, and every rail a man._)




                          *THE NAVAL BRIGADE*


    When youâ€™re pickinâ€™ your men for a fight,
      When choosinâ€™ the corps thatâ€™ll serve,
    Itâ€™s only quite proper anâ€™ right
      To fix upon muscle anâ€™ nerve,
    Anâ€™ so, to your heavy Dragoonsâ€”
      Your Granny-dear Guards anâ€™ their bandâ€”
    To your Sappers with bridginâ€™ pontoons,
      You can buckle the Lower Deck Hand!

    (_The Lower Deck Hand_
      _Doesnâ€™t want any band;_
    _Heâ€™s grit, an heâ€™s sand_
      _Is the Lower Deck Hand._)

    His march is a go-as-you-please;
      He most keeps step with hisself!
    For his boots ainâ€™t conducive to ease,
      Beinâ€™ mostly kept packed on a shelf!
    Thoâ€™ he isnâ€™t so span or so spicâ€”
      Thoâ€™ his marchinâ€™ ainâ€™t what youâ€™d call grandâ€”
    He gets to the front just as quick
      Does the elegant Lower Deck Hand!

    (_The Lower Deck Hand_
      _Wasnâ€™t reared in the Strand;_
    _But heâ€™s good to command,_
      _Is the Lower Deck Hand._)

    You may swear by the jolly marines,
      â€™Per marey, per tareyâ€™ they fightâ€”
    Not speakinâ€™ for them in their â€™teensâ€”
      I donâ€™t mind admittinâ€™ your right.
    But all that the Joey has got,
      As Iâ€™d have all the world understand,
    Heâ€™s learntâ€”well, heâ€™s learnt quite a lot
      From his tooterâ€”the Lower Deck Hand!

    (_The Lower Deck Hand_
      _Is a mine thatâ€™s unpanned;_
    _Anâ€™ heâ€™s yours to command,_
      _Is the Lower Deck Hand._)

    He doesnâ€™t shape well at Reviews,
      Iâ€™ve known him to spit in the ranks;
    But weâ€™ve never been asked to excuse
      A fault, when heâ€™s guarding the flanks.
    Anâ€™ when thereâ€™s a break in the square
      Or a place where the Line cannot stand,
    Iâ€™ll tell you the chap to put thereâ€”
      â€™Jack Mullowâ€™â€”the Lower Deck Hand.

    (_The Lower Deck Hand_
      _Will die as he â€™ll stand;_
    _Heâ€™s tempered an land,_
      _Is the Lower Deck Hand._)

    When youâ€™re hemmed in a tight little hole,
      By a greatly outnumbering foe,
    Itâ€™s a matter of stokinâ€™ anâ€™ coal
      How far weâ€™re away from the foe.
    When the Infantryâ€™s needinâ€™ some aid,
      When the â€™tillery gets under-manâ€™d,â€”
    Make way for the Naval Brigade!â€”
      His Highness the Lower Deck Hand!

    (_The Lower Deck Hand_
      _With his guns he can land,_
    _An heâ€™ll kick up some sand,_
      _Will the Lower Deck Hand._)




                          *THE ARMOURED TRAIN*


    Thereâ€™s risk on the ballasted roadway,
      Thereâ€™s death on the girdered bridge,
    Red ruin from sleeper to sleeper,
      And wreck on the bouldered ridge.
    No signal to herald my coming,
      No whistle to waken the plain;
    Stand clearâ€”I am out for patrolling!
      Make way for the Armoured Train!

    I run not to time, nor to table,
      Iâ€™m neither an â€™Upâ€™ nor a â€™Down,â€™
    But â€™Full speed aheadâ€™ is my order,
      When skirting the enemyâ€™s town.
    My mails have a backing of cordite,
      My luggage is powder and shell,
    With smoke-stack a-blazing I thunder,
      A travellerâ€™s sample of Hell!

    They have laid me a mine by a culvert,
      They have loosened a bolt by a curve,
    But thrice-tested steel is my muscle,
      And thrice-tested brass is my nerve.
    A curse for their bungling folly,
      A laugh for the death-trap that fails,
    A hang for the enemyâ€™s miner,
      So long as I keep to the rails.

    A cheerâ€”and I pull from the township
      To spy out the enemyâ€™s line;
    A plungeâ€”and I rush into darkness
      As reckless of wreckage as mine.
    And what if a rail has been lifted?
      And what if a riverâ€™s unspanned?
    I fail, but I know in the failing
      I strove at the Empireâ€™s command.

    They were men who at Badajos conquered,
      They were men who for Wellington struck,
    And a Man is the Man at the Throttle,
      And a Man is the Man on the Truck.
    Undismayed I may go to destruction.
      For I know at the end I may feel
    I die with the men on the footplate,
      I pass with my brothers in steel.




                      *MAKE YOUR OWN ARRANGEMENTS*


    When the depÃ´t soldierâ€™s dininâ€™ on three-quarters of a pound,
    If thereâ€™s too much bone to please â€™im, or the meat is extry
            tough,
    â€™E â€™as got a chance of grousinâ€™ when â€™is orficer goes round,
    â€™E can draw upon the mess-book, if â€™s rations ainâ€™t enough.
    But itâ€™s make your own arrangements!  Make your own
            arrangements!
    When youâ€™re cut orf from the column, anâ€™ supplies are runninâ€™
            low,
    It ainâ€™t no â€™too much fat, sir!â€™
    But itâ€™s breadâ€”anâ€™ glad of that, sir!
    O itâ€™s _bake_ your own arrangementsâ€”out of flourâ€”as you go!

    When the depÃ´t soldierâ€™s on parade â€™e sparkles anâ€™ â€™e shines.
    When the depÃ´t soldierâ€™s drillinâ€™ â€™e must make each motion
            â€™tell.â€™
    When the depÃ´t soldierâ€™s marchinâ€™ â€™e must march on drill-book
            lines.
    â€™E â€™as got a drill-instructor, anâ€™ â€™e does it very well.
    But itâ€™s make your own arrangements!  Make your own
            arrangements!
    When the camp is rushed at midnight, anâ€™ youâ€™re fallinâ€™ inâ€”to
            die!
    O there ainâ€™t no drill-rules set there,
    But itâ€™s take your gunâ€”anâ€™ get there!
    When you make your own arrangements, you must grab your belt anâ€™
            fly.

    The depÃ´t soldierâ€™s grounded in a systematic drill;
    â€™E also knows wotâ€™s â€™rendezvousâ€™ anâ€™ what is â€™bivouac.â€™
    â€™E knows the use of rifle-pits, the proper way to killâ€”
    â€™E understands the principles anâ€™ theâ€™ries of attack.
    But itâ€™s make your own arrangements!  Make your own
            arrangements!
    When youâ€™re dodginâ€™ tons of boulder, climbinâ€™ mountâ€™ins under
            fire,
    Anâ€™ the drill-book wonâ€™t assist you
    Till the fallinâ€™ rocks â€™ave missed you!
    So you make your own arrangementsâ€”anâ€™ you climb a little â€™igher!

    When the depÃ´t soldierâ€™s wantinâ€™ with â€™is orficer to speak,
    â€™E must â€™alt two paces from â€™im, anâ€™ salute before the start.
    Anâ€™ â€™e mustnâ€™t try to argue, anâ€™ â€™e mustnâ€™t give no cheek;
    Anâ€™ if â€™is Captain slangs â€™imâ€”â€™e must take it in good part.
    But itâ€™s make your own arrangements!  Make your own
            arrangements!
    When you see â€™im lying wounded, all the circumstances change.
    Anâ€™ you donâ€™t â€™eed no instructions;
    Anâ€™ you donâ€™t need introductions;
    But you make your own arrangementsâ€”anâ€™ you get â€™im out of range.

    When the depÃ´t soldier sickens, when the depÃ´t soldier dies,
    â€™E is buried by â€™is comrades in the regulation style.
    â€™E is covered by an ensign of the regulation size,
    Anâ€™ â€™e gets a firinâ€™ party made of thirteen rank anâ€™ file.
    But itâ€™s make your own arrangements!  Make your own
            arrangements!
    When the Colonel reads the service by a guard-room lantern
            light.
    When in silent rows youâ€™ve laid â€™em
    In a trench your bayâ€™nets made â€™em,
    O, itâ€™s make your own arrangements when you bury in the night!




                             *GINGER JAMES*


      A spell I â€™ad to wait
      Outside the barrick gate,
    For Ginger James was passinâ€™ out as I was passinâ€™ in;
      â€™E was only a recruit,
      But I give â€™im the salute,
    For Iâ€™ll never git another chance of givinâ€™ it agin!

      â€™Eâ€™d little brains, Iâ€™ll swear,
      Beneath â€™is ginger â€™air,
    â€™Is personal attractions, well, they wasnâ€™t very large;
      â€™E was fust in evâ€™ry mill,
      Anâ€™ a foul-mouthed brute, but still
    Weâ€™ll forgive â€™im all â€™is drawbacksâ€”â€™e â€™as taken â€™is discharge.

      â€™E once got fourteen days,
      For drunken, idle ways,
    Anâ€™ the Colonel said the nasty things that colonels sometimes
            say;
      â€™E called him to â€™is face
      The regimentâ€™s disgraceâ€”
    But the Colonel took â€™is â€™at off when â€™e passed â€™im by to-day.

      For days â€™e used to dwell
      Inside a guard-room cell,
    Where they put the darbies on â€™im for a â€™owlinâ€™ savage brute;
      But as by the guard â€™e went
      They gave â€™im the present,
    The little bugler sounded off the â€™General Salute.â€™

      The band turned out to play
      Poor Ginger James away;
    â€™Is Captain anâ€™ â€™is Company came down to see â€™im off;
      Anâ€™ thirteen file anâ€™ rank,
      With three rounds each of blank;
    Anâ€™ â€™e rode down on a carriage, like a bloominâ€™ city toff!

      â€™E doesnâ€™t want no pass,
      â€™Eâ€™s journeying first-class;
    â€™Is travâ€™lling rugâ€™s a Union Jack, which isnâ€™t bad at all;
      The tune the drummers play
      It ainâ€™t so very gay,
    But a rather slow selection, from a piece thatâ€™s known as
            â€™Saul.â€™




                   *â€™HER MAJESTY HAS BEEN PLEASEDâ€”â€™*


      Wot a crowd of people!
      Wot a sea of faces!
    â€™Ow the ladiesâ€™ parasols are glistâ€™ninâ€™ in the sun!
      Troops in â€™open order,â€™
      Captains in their places.
    Wish the day was over, and I wish the job was done!

      Wot a lot of civvies!
      Musâ€™ be â€™arf the city!
    Like a mob on Boxing-night outside Drury Lane!
      Ainâ€™t it perfect weather?
      Moreâ€™s the blessed pity!
    Wish instead of sunshine it was pourinâ€™ â€™ard oâ€™ rain!

      Comes of beinâ€™ famousâ€”
      Mentioned in despatches!
    Comes of me a-carrying the Major to the rear!
      Empty stomach fightingâ€”
      Getting sleep by snatches!â€”
    â€™Ow the troops must cuss me for a-keeping them out â€™ere!

      â€™Ow the people eye me,
      Like a choice chrysanthâ€™um!
    â€™Ow this collarâ€™s chokinâ€™ me!â€”Lord!  Iâ€™m feelinâ€™ sick!
      Troops are at the â€™shoulderâ€™â€”
      â€™Pre-sentâ€™â€”thereâ€™s the anthem!
    â€™Ow I â€™ope â€™er Majesty will get it over quick!

      Wonder if Iâ€™m dusty?
      â€™Elmet feels lopsided!
    Chuck a chest for â€™Eavenâ€™s sake!  _Lord_, Iâ€™m feelinâ€™ queer!
      Twenty times theyâ€™ve brushed me,
      Twice â€™ave I been tidied,
    Yet Iâ€™m feelinâ€™ mucky still.  Private Jawkins?  â€™ERE!

      Face the lan-dow panels,
      Dumbly; likewise blindly,
    Seeinâ€™ in a sorter mist a lady dressed in black:
      â€™Ear â€™er sofâ€™ly talkinâ€™.
      Thanks, mum, thank you kindly!
    Saw the Major fallinâ€™, and I â€™ad to take â€™im back!

      Thank you, mumâ€”your â€™Ighnessâ€”
      Majesty, I mean, mum!
    â€™M sure Iâ€™m much obliged to you for this â€™ere pretty Cross!
      Bless you, youâ€™re a lady!
      Mean you are the Queen, mum!
    Onâ€™y picked the Major up anâ€™ shoved â€™im on an â€™orse!

      â€™Saw our Sub go under,
      â€™Alf â€™is men around â€™im
    Cut to bitsâ€”anâ€™ â€™im so young,â€”yes mum, very sad.
      Yes mum, â€™e was buried
      In the place we found â€™im.
    Thank you, mum,â€”your Majesty (God, Iâ€™m feelinâ€™ bad!)




                                *ARTHUR*


    â€™Ooâ€™s the Genâ€™ral â€™ere? sez I;
      â€™Ooâ€™s the Genâ€™ral â€™ere?
    â€™O, â€™eâ€™s a Prince oâ€™ the Royal Blood, so you â€™avenâ€™t got
          nothinâ€™ to fear.â€™
    But â€™e marched me â€™ere, anâ€™ â€™e marched me there,
    To burn blank cartridges everywhere;
    Anâ€™ â€™e made me sweat, anâ€™ â€™e made me swearâ€”
        Did Arthur!

    Wot can the Genâ€™ral do? sez I;
      Wot can the Genâ€™ral do?
    â€™O, â€™e â€™s a Prince oâ€™ the Royal Blood, anâ€™ â€™e donâ€™t know
          much about _you_!â€™
    But â€™e doubled me round on a big field day:
    Anâ€™ â€™e checked me for loafinâ€™â€”a mile away!
    Anâ€™ I found thereâ€™s a time for work anâ€™ play
        With Arthur!

    Wot â€™as the Genâ€™ral done, sez I?
      Wot â€™as the Genâ€™ral done?
    â€™O, â€™eâ€™s a Prince oâ€™ the Royal Blood, anâ€™ they chucked â€™im â€™is
          rank for fun!â€™
    But that was a lie, for I found out since
    â€™Eâ€™s ninepence a soldier anâ€™ thruppence a prince!
    â€™E stood fire in Egypt, anâ€™ â€™e didnâ€™t wince!
        Not Arthur!

    Wot does the Genâ€™ral know? sez I;
      Wot does the Genâ€™ral know?
    â€™O, â€™eâ€™s a Prince oâ€™ the Royal Blood, anâ€™ â€™e â€™s onâ€™y
          got up for show!â€™
    But I â€™chancedâ€™ kit inspection, anâ€™ thought it a â€™cert.â€™;
    But â€™e put me down, smart, for a tunic anâ€™ shirt!
    Anâ€™, insult to injuryâ€”checked me for dirt!
        Did Arthur!

    â€™Ow is â€™e liked by you? sez I;
      â€™Ow is â€™e liked by you?
    â€™O, â€™eâ€™s a Prince oâ€™ the Royal Blood, but I reckon
        someâ€™ow â€™eâ€™ll do!â€™

    Iâ€™m willinâ€™ to risk, as Iâ€™ve done before,
    A Fox â€™Ills fight, or a native war,
    Or front rank man in an Army Corps,
      With Arthur!

    Wot is â€™e, after all? sez I;
      Wot is â€™e, after all?
    â€™O, â€™eâ€™s a swaddle, the same as you, anâ€™ â€™e goes to the
          "orficersâ€™ call"!â€™
    â€™Eâ€™s a gentleman, Tommy, when allâ€™s said anâ€™ done!
    â€™Is ma is the lady â€™oo â€™s second to none,
    Anâ€™ we love â€™er the better because of â€™er sonâ€”
        Thatâ€™s Arthur!




                               *LEGACIES*


    The dog is yours; and soâ€™s the photo frames,
      Them pictures wot I cut, anâ€™ my new box.
    The pack of cards, the dominoes, anâ€™ games,
      The knittinâ€™ needles, anâ€™ the knitted socks,
    Anâ€™ all, except the letters and the ringâ€”
    Youâ€™ll find them all together tied with string.

    My public clothinâ€™â€”that goes back to storesâ€”
      My kitâ€™ll sell by auction on the square;
    Anâ€™ other fellers will be â€™forminâ€™ foursâ€™
      Anâ€™ â€™markinâ€™ timeâ€™ in boots I used to wear.
    Theyâ€™re welcome; but you wonâ€™t forget to send
    The ring anâ€™ all the letters to myâ€”â€”friend?

    The pain ainâ€™t near so bad as wot it were
      The day they dragged me from the limber wheels;
    Ainâ€™t I a wreck! for Godâ€™s sake donâ€™t tell â€™er;
      Say it was feverâ€”peacefulâ€”in the â€™ills;
    Anâ€™ write about the wreaths, the â€™Jack,â€™ and band,
    Anâ€™â€”send a bit of hair: you understand?

    The ringâ€”â€”  Oh no, the doctor lets me talk,
      I ainâ€™t a-tirinâ€™â€”â€™cept a funny light,
    Anâ€™ just a feelinâ€™ that Iâ€™d like to walk
      To where it seems to flicker in the night.
    Better for me to go with aching â€™ead,
    Than go in trouble with my say unsaid.

    The ringâ€”it ainâ€™t long since she sent it back;
      I never meant no â€™arm, God only knows,
    But thingsâ€”I canâ€™t tell nowâ€”looked very black,
      And she believed the othersâ€”I suppose,
    Iâ€™m sorry for â€™er nowâ€”that cursed wheel!â€”
    You see she is a woman, anâ€™ sheâ€™ll _feel_.

        *      *      *      *      *

    The dog is yours, I told you that before.
      The spurs youâ€™ll find â€™em in my private kit.
    The letters, anâ€™ the ring, anâ€™ nothinâ€™ more,â€”
      _Anâ€™_ hairâ€”itâ€™s foolishâ€”but a little bit.

        *      *      *      *      *

    â€™Our Fatherâ€™â€”Lord, how strange!  Itâ€™s allâ€”riâ€™â€”sir.
    _Theâ€”lettâ€”anâ€”thâ€™â€”ringâ€”anâ€™â€”hairâ€”forâ€”â€™er!_




                            *T. A. IN LOVE*


    Dreaminâ€™ of thee!  Dreaminâ€™ of thee!
    Sittinâ€™ with my elbow on my knee.
    I _orter_ be a polishinâ€™ the meat-dish anâ€™ the canâ€”
    (I _orter_ draw the groceriesâ€”for I am ordâ€™ly man!
    But wot are bloominâ€™ ration calls, anâ€™ wotâ€™s a pot or pan,
    When Iâ€™m dreaming O my darlinâ€™ one, of thee?)
    Dreaminâ€™ of thee!  Dreaminâ€™ of thee!

    Firinâ€™ at the rifle range I be.
    Iâ€™ve missed a fust-class targitâ€”anâ€™ Iâ€™ve missed the â€™ill beâ€™ind!
    I nearly shot a marker once! (which wasnâ€™t very kind);
    The orficer â€™e swears at meâ€”but reâ€™ly, I donâ€™t mind!
    I am dreaminâ€™, O my darlinâ€™ one, of thee!

    Dreaminâ€™ of thee!  Dreaminâ€™ of thee!
    Me, as was the smartest man in â€™Bâ€™!
    My kit is all untidy, and itâ€™s inches thick in dust;
    Anâ€™ my rifleâ€™s fouled anâ€™ filthy, anâ€™ my bayâ€™nitâ€™s red with
            rust;
    Theyâ€™ve tried to find the reasonâ€”but Iâ€™ve seen â€™em furder fust!
    Anâ€™ they never guess Iâ€™m dreaminâ€™, dear, of thee!

    Dreaminâ€™ of thee!  Dreaminâ€™ of thee!
    They canâ€™t make out wotâ€™s cominâ€™ over me.
    The fellows think Iâ€™m barmy, anâ€™ the Major thinks itâ€™s drink,
    The Sergeant thought it laziness, so shoved me in the clink!
    The Colonel called it â€™thoughtlessness,â€™ so gave me time to
            think,
    Anâ€™ to dream again, my darlinâ€™ one, of thee!

    Dreaminâ€™ of thee!  Dreaminâ€™ of thee!
    Wotâ€™s two â€™oursâ€™ sentry-go to me?
    A sittinâ€™ in the sentry-box, a-thinkinâ€™ of your eyes,
    The ordâ€™ly orficer come along, anâ€™ took me by surprise!
    â€™E said as I was sleepinâ€™â€”anâ€™ the usual orfice lies!
    When I was onâ€™y dreaminâ€™, love, of thee!

    Dreaminâ€™ of thee!  Dreaminâ€™ of thee!
    Rubbinâ€™ tarry oakum on my knee!
    Oh, when I weigh that oakum in, I know Iâ€™ll cop it â€™ot!
    Iâ€™ll be â€™auled before the Govâ€™nor, anâ€™ Iâ€™ll git an â€™ourâ€™s shot;
    But whether I git punishment, or whether I do not,
    They canâ€™t prevent me dreaminâ€™, love, of thee!




                            *TOMMY ADVISES*


      Take your rifle from the rack:
      Take your bayâ€™nit from the shelf;
      Clean your straps for marchinâ€™ order,
      Anâ€™ git ready for the Border.
      For it ainâ€™t no sham attack,
      So you neednâ€™t kid yourself.
      Itâ€™s a ball anâ€™ bayâ€™nit action
      With the perfect satisfaction
    Of a medal, anâ€™ a ribbon, and perhaps a clasp or two.
    For a-doinâ€™ of the little job your betters couldnâ€™t do.

      Pack your socks, anâ€™ fold your shirt,
      Wash your water-bottle out,
      Itâ€™ll make your marchinâ€™ easy
      If your boots are nice anâ€™ greasy,â€”
      Anâ€™ some dubbin wouldnâ€™t â€™urt.
      You can chuck your weight about;
      Thereâ€™s an â€™appy day before you,
      When the civvies will adore you,
    And the things wot used to shock â€™em will be favoured with a
            smile.
    And your little faults anâ€™ failinâ€™s wonâ€™t be noticed for a
            while.

      Git a guernsey out of storeâ€”
      Winterâ€™s very cold above,
      Anâ€™ the wind anâ€™ rain will find you
      If you leave your clothes behind you!
      Trust your pretty self before
      Any Quartermasterâ€™s love;
      For thereâ€™s no store to go unto
      Anâ€™ no tailorsâ€™ shops to run to;
    For it ainâ€™t no ten daysâ€™ skirmish these manoeuvres wot youâ€™re
            in,
    Anâ€™ a little flannel weskit â€™ides a multitood of skin!

      Write your letters for the mail;
      Tell your people all the newsâ€”
      For your folksâ€™ll prize the writinâ€™
      Of â€™my son whoâ€™s out a-fightinâ€™.â€™
      Donâ€™t you spin an awful tale,
      Just to give your mother blues,
      For the day the boys are cryinâ€™
      â€™List oâ€™ wounded, dead and dyinâ€™!â€™
    Will be tons of time for them at â€™ome to feel a trifle blue,
    When they see a dozen Smiths are killedâ€”and wonder which is you!




                            *THE NUMBER ONE*


    The number one, â€™eâ€™s on the bridge,
    Thereâ€™s goinâ€™ to be a row,
    The Gold Coast is upon our port,
    Anâ€™, â€™ull down, on our bow;
    Makinâ€™ for â€™ome for all sheâ€™s worthâ€”
    A slaverâ€™s bloominâ€™ dhow!

    The number one is on the bridge,
    The buntinâ€™ tosserâ€™s aft;
    Anâ€™ down below, in the â€™eat anâ€™ glow,
    The men are at their graft.
    Theyâ€™ve peeled their shirts, to get the steam,
    To over-â€™aul that craft.

    The number one is in command,
    The skipperâ€™s sick below,
    A touch oâ€™ fever from the coast,
    â€™As made the old man so;
    But â€™eâ€™s passed the word to the engineer,
    â€™For Gawdâ€™s sake make â€™er go!â€™

    The â€™genâ€™ral quartersâ€™ sounded orf,
    The buglerâ€™s made a call
    (A call that means the â€™redâ€™ marines,
    With fifty rounds of ball,
    Are goinâ€™ to git a medal anâ€™ clasp,
    Or an ensign for a pall!)

    The number one is on the bridge,
    The sun is low anâ€™ red!
    Anâ€™ shot anâ€™ shell, like fiends of â€™ell,
    Are shriekinâ€™ round â€™is â€™ead,
    Anâ€™ three marines are crippled,
    Anâ€™ their sergeant-majorâ€™s dead!

    The number one is on the bridge,
    The dhowâ€™s a battered sight;
    â€™Er rascal chief â€™as come to grief;
    â€™Eâ€™s fought â€™is final fight,
    But the number one lies on the bridge,
    Anâ€™ â€™is face is ghastly white.

    A smile is on â€™is bloodless lips,
    â€™Is sword â€™angs from â€™is wrist,
    And a lock of â€™air of a maiden fair.
    Is clasped in â€™is bloodstained fist,
    But â€™eâ€™ll meet â€™er at the great roll-call,
    When they muster by â€™open listâ€™!




                     *BRITANNIA TO HER FIRST-BORN*


    I am no maiden, highly strung,
    To faint, when bloody death is nigh.
    I have not lived, by might of tongue
    Nor by vain boastings, wind-wide flung!
    But on fameâ€™s endless ladder, I
    Have fought my way, from rung to rung!

    I am no fretful, whimpâ€™ring miss;
    I am a woman, learned of years.
    And once I felt your baby kiss:
    Your bliss for me had greater bliss!
    Your youthful sorrows had my tears.
    O son oâ€™ mine, remember this!

    Your foes were mine, in those dear days:
    Your friends were kind, and kin to me.
    We partedâ€”so, we will not raise
    The long dead years.  We went our ways,
    I, brooding by the cold grey sea;
    You, pride-flushed, with your new-won bays!

    The years have passed; it does but seem
    As yester-eve you left my side.
    I journeyed with you, dream on dreamâ€”
    I heard your great war eagleâ€™s scream!
    And on sweet Progress, your fair bride,
    I saw the sun of Fortuneâ€™s beam!

    I mourned your follies, word and deed;
    I watched your rising, when you rose,
    By sober prayer, by Cross and Bead;
    Until you found that greater Creed,
    That in the broader channel flows,
    The lowly truths, that higher lead!

    You are my son, and born of me.
    My laws of Right are Laws to you
    Whose hands were stained in blood, to be
    The hands that set the slave-man free!
    And now, again, you dare and doâ€”
    For Justice, and Humanity!

    The days to be are big with Fate!
    Go fight your battle, Son oâ€™ mine:
    And State to Shire, and Shire to State,
    Its better self shall dedicate!
    So, let the wily foe combine,
    Whilst, hand-locked, heart-locked, we can wait!




                        *TOMMY TO HIS LAUREATE*

                    (CAPETOWN, _January_ 25, 1898.)


    O good-morninâ€™, Mister Kiplinâ€™!  You are welcome to our shores:
    To the land of millionaires and potted meat:
    To the country of the â€™fonteinsâ€™ (we â€™ave got no â€™badsâ€™ or
            â€™poresâ€™),
    To the place where diâ€™monds lay about the street
      At your feet;
    To the â€™unting-ground of raiders indiscreet.

    I suppose you know this station, for you sort of keep in touch
    With Tommy wheresoever â€™e may go;
    Anâ€™ you know our â€™batâ€™sâ€™ a shandy, made of â€™Ottentot anâ€™ Dutch,
    Itâ€™s a language which is â€™ideous anâ€™ low,
      Donâ€™t you know
    That itâ€™s â€™Wacht-een-beitjeâ€™ â€™stead of â€™â€™Arf a moâ€™?â€™

    We should like to come anâ€™ meet you, but we canâ€™t without a
            pass;
    Even then weâ€™d â€™ardly like to make a fuss;
    For out â€™ere, theyâ€™ve got a notion that a Tommy isnâ€™t class;
    â€™Eâ€™s a sort of brainless animal, or wuss!
      Vicious cuss!
    No, they donâ€™t expect intelligence from us.

    You â€™ave met us in the tropics, you â€™ave met us in the snows;
    But mostly in the Punjab anâ€™ the â€™Ills.
    You â€™ave seen us in Mauritius, where the naughty cyclone blows.
    You â€™ave met us underneath a sun that kills,
      Anâ€™ we grills!
    Anâ€™ I ask you, do we fill the bloominâ€™ bills?

    Since the time when Tommyâ€™s uniform was musketoon anâ€™ wig,
    There â€™as always been a bloke wot â€™ad a way
    Of writinâ€™ of the Glory anâ€™ forgettinâ€™ the fatigâ€™,
    â€™Oo saw â€™im in â€™is tunic day by day,
      Smart anâ€™ gay,
    Anâ€™ forgot about the smallness of his pay!

    But youâ€™re _our_ particâ€™lar author, youâ€™re our patron anâ€™ our
            friend,
    Youâ€™re the poet of the cuss-word anâ€™ the swear,
    Youâ€™re the poet of the people, where the red-mapped lands
            extend,
    Youâ€™re the poet of the jungle anâ€™ the lair,
      Anâ€™ compare,
    To the ever-speaking voice of everywhere!

    There are poets wot can please you with their primrose-viâ€™let
            lays,
    There are poets wot can drive a man to drink;
    But it takes a â€™pukkaâ€™ poet, in a Patriotic Craze,
    To make a chortlinâ€™ nation squirm anâ€™ shrink,
      Gasp anâ€™ blink;
    Anâ€™ â€™eedless, thoughtless people stop anâ€™ think!

    Yes, the â€™and wot banged the banjo anâ€™ made Tommy comic songs,
    â€™Oo wrote of Empires, â€™Lionâ€™s â€™Ead to Line,â€™
    â€™Oo found an â€™idden poem in Mâ€™Andrewâ€™s Injin gongs,
    Was the checkinâ€™ â€™and wot gave the warninâ€™ sign,
      In a lineâ€”
    That gave the people soda after wine.




                       *THE MISSION THAT FAILED*


    Our troop was encamped by the side of a stream
      Anâ€™ a very smart troop were we.
    We â€™ad Cavalry orficersâ€”straight from town,
      Anâ€™ we escorted Mister Commissioner Brown,
    Commissioner Brown, C.B.
      Anâ€™ we â€™eard that the Governor put â€™im down,
    For a spare K.C.M.G.!

    We wos camped near by to a border town,
      On the borders of Creegerlandâ€”
    A very despotic, republican stateâ€”
      Anâ€™ there we â€™ad got the order to wait,
    But why, we did not understand.
      So we bedded our â€™orses, anâ€™ cussed at our fate
    (For you canâ€™t cuss the man in command).

    One morninâ€™ sez Mister Commissioner Brown,
      Sez â€™e to the â€™ole parade,
    â€™Iâ€™ve bin inspired by a dream just nowâ€”
      I canâ€™t say why, anâ€™ I canâ€™t say â€™owâ€”
    But a voice in my dream it said,
      "O in Joannistown thereâ€™s a deuce of a row
    And badly they want your aid!"â€™

    Now Joannistown is in Creegerland,
      Which same is a friendly state.
    Anâ€™ it isnâ€™t no jokeâ€”which is puttinâ€™ it fineâ€”
      To pass without notice the border-post sign;
    But we did it, as I will relate.â€”
      We really intended to drop â€™em a line!
    But we â€™adnâ€™t got time to wait.

    We â€™ad ridden some miles into Creegerland
      When Commissioner Brown, C.B.,
    â€™E called an â€™alt,â€”which a troop requires,
      For a man, â€™e tires, as â€™is â€™orse perspires,â€”
    Anâ€™ â€™e sez to the troop, sez â€™e,
      â€™About ten miles from â€™ere are some telegraph wires,
    Anâ€™ a very good thought struck me.

    â€™For fear of my dream beinâ€™ misunderstood
      Anâ€™ the evil constructions of liars!â€”
    For fear of alarminâ€™ the dear farmersâ€™ wives
      Anâ€™ disturbinâ€™ the quiet anâ€™ peace of their lives,
    I think we will sever them wires!
      Anâ€™ Iâ€™ll give somethinâ€™ â€™andsome to â€™im â€™oo contrives
    To cut off the currentâ€”with pliers!â€™

    Anâ€™ Michael Mâ€™Carty, Lance-Corpâ€™ral was â€™e,
      Right guide to a section of â€™A,â€™
    Started orf on the job, anâ€™ we whispered a cheer,
      Anâ€™ we each gave the beggar our flasksâ€”full of beerâ€”
    To â€™elp for to lighten â€™is way!
      We gave â€™im cheap drinksâ€”though it was very dear
    When it came round to settling day!

    Mâ€™Carty â€™e rode, anâ€™ Mâ€™Carty â€™e swilled,
      Anâ€™ Mâ€™Carty got big in the â€™ead,
    Till â€™e couldnâ€™t tell telegraph poles from trees,
      Anâ€™ â€™e wandered around, sorter go-as-you-please
    Till â€™is wonderinâ€™ wanderinâ€™s led
      To the wiresâ€”of a fence! anâ€™ reclininâ€™ at ease
    â€™E cut up these wasters instead!

    Itâ€™s all over now: anâ€™ Brown â€™e got jugged,
      And the Burghers of Creegerland knowed.
    They licked us to fits in a sweet little fight,
      Anâ€™ the King of Jerusalem wired â€™is delight!
    Anâ€™ the Laureate wrote us an Ode!
      Anâ€™ Europe got ready for action that night
    â€™Cos Mâ€™Carty got drunk on the road!

    Mâ€™Cartyâ€™s a thief, Mâ€™Cartyâ€™s a beast,
      Anâ€™ Mâ€™Carty is likewise a liar!
    â€™E went anâ€™ got drunk, which â€™e shouldnâ€™t â€™ave done;
      â€™E went anâ€™ got drunk, anâ€™ â€™e spoilt the â€™ole fun:
    Anâ€™ the moral to them wot conspire
      Is, _Donâ€™t send a beer-swilling son of a gun_
    _When youâ€™re cuttin a telegraph wire!_




                              *THE PRAYER*


      O God of Battles!  Lord of Might!
    A sentry, in the silent night,
      I, â€™oo â€™ave never prayed,
    Kneel on the dew-damp sands, to say,
    O see me through the cominâ€™ dayâ€”
    But, please remember, though I pray,
      That I am not afraid!

      O God of Battles!  Lord of Might!
    â€™Ere in the dusky, starry light,
      My inner self Iâ€™ve weighed;
    Anâ€™ I â€™ave seen my guilt anâ€™ sin;
    Iâ€™m black as black can be, within,
    But though I would forgiveness win,
      It ainâ€™t â€™cos Iâ€™m afraid!

      O God of Battles!  Lord of Might!
    Keep me, to-morrow, in Your sight!â€”
      Far â€™ave I erred anâ€™ strayed.
    Iâ€™ve flaunted You, with gibe anâ€™ sneer,
    At â€™ome, with chums to laugh and cheer,
    But now, I am aloneâ€”out â€™ere!
      But still I ainâ€™t afraid!

      O God of Battles!  Lord of Might!
    The enâ€™myâ€™s camp-fires twinkle bright.
      To-morrow, Lord, Your aid;
    The canteen was my Sunday-school:
    The drill-book was my Golden Rule;
    Wot are they now?  O â€™elpless fool!
      But still, Iâ€™m not afraid!

      O God of Battles!  Lord of Might!
    The price of every thoughtless slight
      To-morrow will be paid!
    A voice is whispâ€™rinâ€™ to my â€™eartâ€”
    A voice that makes me sweat anâ€™ start!â€”
    â€™To-morrow, soul anâ€™ soldier part!â€™
      But Iâ€”Iâ€™m not afraid!

      O God of Battles!  Lord of Might!
    â€™Ere, in the silence of the night,
      My â€™umble prayer is prayed!
    All life anâ€™ death are one to you!
    If I must dieâ€”O â€™elp me to!
    In that last moment, see me throughâ€”
      My God!  I _am_ afraid!




                              *CEASE FIRE*


    The fight was done an hour ago:
      The whole brigade has fallen back,
    And Iâ€™ve been wandâ€™rinâ€™ to and fro,
      A-askinâ€™ anyâ€”white or black,
      â€™Sayâ€”have you seen my brother, Jack?
      His troop was first in the attack!â€™

    I should have seen him here by now:
      An hour ago the â€™cease fireâ€™ went.
    He isnâ€™t wounded anyâ€™ow,
      â€™Cos with the stretcher squads I went,
      Anâ€™ all my other time Iâ€™ve spent
      A-hanginâ€™ round the doctorâ€™s tent.

    Among the huddled, fallen men
      I picked a way across the plain.
    I got a dozen yards, anâ€™ then
      Came back for fear Iâ€™d turn my brain....
      The mangled horrors of the slain!
      O Christ!  I canâ€™t go _there_ again!

    Say, have _you_ seen my brother Jack?
      Donâ€™t know! anâ€™ damn you, donâ€™t much care!â€”
    But â€™scuse me, chum, a-talkinâ€™ back,
      Iâ€™m sorter flustered with the glare.
      These sands are hot, anâ€™ soâ€™s the airâ€”
      Perhaps heâ€™s doinâ€™ guard somewhere!

    Old mother said before we went,
      â€™Be sure you keep him in your sightâ€™
    (Not knowinâ€™ what a campaign meant).
      â€™Donâ€™t let him stay out late oâ€™ night!â€™â€”
      I wonder if he funked the fight
      Anâ€™ bolted.  O pray God he might!

    Theyâ€™re layinâ€™ out our dead just now,
      He canâ€™t beâ€”â€”, no, thatâ€”that ainâ€™t sense,
    Anâ€™ when he comes thereâ€™ll be a row!
      A-keepinâ€™ me in this suspense!
      â€™Tis here our line of killed commence,
      Iâ€™ll sorter lookâ€”for make-pretence!

    Pretendinâ€™ some oneâ€™s here I knowâ€”
      Iâ€™m half inclined to turn abackâ€”
    But one by one, along I go,
      And see the crimson clottinâ€™ black....
      _His troop was first in the attack!_
      What!  Jack!  Is thisâ€”this Thing our Jack?




                          *TOMMYâ€™S AUTOGRAPH*


    I â€™ad lorst my situation, anâ€™ the girl she got the â€™ump,
    Anâ€™ the nagginâ€™ of my muvver nearly drove me orf my chump.
    So I â€™oofed it down to Woolwich, to the old recruitinâ€™ starf,
    Anâ€™ they give to me a paper for to fix my autygrarf!

      Just to fix my autygrarf!
      Lorâ€™ you should a â€™eard me larf!
    For the blessed Sergeant-Major wos a tryinâ€™ on â€™is chaff.
      Didnâ€™t mind the Doctorâ€™s soundinâ€™s,
      Nor â€™is soap anâ€™ water barf!
    But the fing as knocked me silly wos that bloominâ€™ autygrarf!

    I wos took before the colonel, anâ€™ I took a Bible oaf
    That Iâ€™d serve my Queen anâ€™ country, anâ€™ be square unto them
            boaf.
    Then they got a printed paper, anâ€™ this Colonel on the starf
    Sez, â€™Youâ€™ll kindly read this over, anâ€™ affix your autygrarf!â€™

      To affix my autygrarf!
      Larf!  You orter â€™eard me larf!
    Signinâ€™ fings like â€™â€™Enry Irvin,â€™ Knight Commornder of the Barf!
      Made me want to do a swagger
      Like a Piccadilly calf!
    Onâ€™y fancy!  People wantinâ€™ Tommy Atkinsâ€™ autygrarf!

    Then I signs my name anâ€™ birfplace, anâ€™ the county I wos from,
    Anâ€™ I dots the â€™iâ€™ in Atkins, anâ€™ I crorst the â€™tâ€™ in tom.
    A recruit is wurf a dollar, anâ€™ the sergeant gets an â€™arf;
    Just for â€™andinâ€™ me a paper for to put my autygrarf!

      Just to put my autygrarf!
      Larf?  You should â€™ave â€™eard them larf!
    From the colonel wiv â€™is spurs on, to the sergeant in â€™is scarf.
      When I sez, â€™Wotâ€™s this for, mister?â€™
      Sez the colonel, â€™Go to Barf!â€™
    â€™Donâ€™t you know the Queen is anxious for to get your autygrarf?â€™

    I â€™ave autygrarfed for clobber, I â€™ave autygrarfed for pay;
    I â€™ave signed it wiv a flourish, I â€™ave signed it wiv a â€™jâ€™
    On an Army Temperance pledge-book
      (O the straight anâ€™ narrer parf!)â€”
    To a â€™drunkâ€™ fine in the pay list, Iâ€™ve affixed my autygrarf!

      Wot a name!  An autygrarf!
      â€™Nuff to drive a feller darf;
    Callinâ€™ Christian name an â€™autyâ€™ anâ€™ the uvver name a â€™grarf,â€™
      Writinâ€™ in a pocket-ledgerâ€”
      â€™Stead of album bound in calfâ€”
    â€™Doo to soldier: Nilâ€™ (thatâ€™s Latin), anâ€™ your bloominâ€™
            autygrarf!




                            *AT THE BRINK!*


    â€™Tis now, as we tighten the girth,
      â€™Tis now, as we buckle the sword,
    When bitterness hardens our mirth,
      â€™Tis now that we seek you, O Lord!
    Give us hope now the future is black,
      From fatuous arrogance wardâ€”
    The words that we cannot hold back!
      Give peace in our time, O Lord!

    You know of the hateâ€”folly born;
      You know of the wrathâ€”money bred;
    The impotent rage, and the scorn,
      The trust and the faith that are dead.
    Lest sorrow should spring from the landâ€”
      The crop of the seed of the swordâ€”
    O, stay the imperious hand;
      Give peace in our time, O Lord!

    â€™Tis good when the man loves the land,
      â€™Tis good when he falls for his creed,
    But woe to the hate that is fanned
      By folly begotten of greed.
    When the weak become foolishly strong,
      When peoples, unwitting, applaud,â€”
    The folly wrought wrongâ€”still is wrong!
      Give peace in our time, O Lord!

    When the voice in the senate is stilled;
      When the councillor speaks in a tent;
    When the lands are untended, untilled;
      What use if the stubborn relent?
    What gain will the simpletonâ€™s shame,
      The shrifts and lamentings, afford?
    To-day, on their conduct, the blame;
      Give peace in our time, O Lord!

    Give peace: that is rooted in Right.
      Give peace: that is strengthened by Grace.
    Give peace: that we stand in your sight,
      Thrice over a justified race.
    â€™Tis peaceâ€”and with honourâ€”we need,
      And the child of our child shall award
    The praise for our failing, or deed.
      Give peace in our time, O Lord!




                       *THE KING OF OOJEE-MOOJEE*


    We â€™ave stowed our ammunition, we â€™ave taken in our store,
    Anâ€™ our very last instructions we â€™ave â€™ad by semy-fore;
    The Flagshipâ€™s made a signal, â€™We wish you all success,â€™
    Anâ€™ weâ€™re off to Oojee-Moojee on the armoured cruiser â€™Bess.â€™

    _For the King of Oojee-Moojee_
    _Is a-comin of â€™is tricks,_
    _â€™Eâ€™s cheeked the English Consul,_
    _An â€™eâ€™s chucked â€™is wooden bricks._
    _â€™E wonâ€™t do kindergarden,_
    _Anâ€™ â€™eâ€™s done â€™is lessons wrong;_
    _Altogether Oojee-Moojee_
    _Is a-cominâ€™ of it strong!_

    Anâ€™ the Point is miles beâ€™ind us, anâ€™ â€™eadquarters furder still;
    Weâ€™ve exchanged a friendly greetinâ€™ wiâ€™ the bloke on Signal
            â€™Ill;
    We are off to Oojee-Moojee, anâ€™ we cannot be detained,
    For relations dip-lo-matic â€™ave become a trifle strained!

    Now the King of Oojee-Moojee is a little coloured kid;
    Anâ€™ â€™e rules some thousand niggers, anâ€™ â€™e does as â€™e is bid!
    For the Government of England, with â€™is interests in view,
    â€™As civilised â€™is countryâ€”anâ€™ collects â€™is revenue!

    For the King wot reigned afore â€™im was an â€™eathen nigger thief,
    So we sent a missionary, for to teach â€™im our belief.
    (To prevent misunderstandinâ€™s, anâ€™ avoid unpleasant scenes,
    We likewise sent an â€™Otchkiss, anâ€™ a â€™undred red marines.)

    â€™E wouldnâ€™t take our gospel, anâ€™ unpleasantness arose,
    Which cost six whites, and niggermen proportionate to those;
    Anâ€™ we left the King a-swinginâ€™ from a â€™Lyptus tree above,
    Just to show as there was iron underneath the velvet glove.

    Then our skipper very kindly did an â€™andsome sort of thing,
    For â€™e made a proclamation that the nevvy of the Kingâ€”
    A funny little kiddy, with a sat-on sorter faceâ€”
    Should rule the Oojee-Moojee, anâ€™ should take â€™is uncleâ€™s place.

    So we dressed â€™im up in velvets, anâ€™ we fed â€™im up on buns,
    Anâ€™ we gave â€™is bit of buntinâ€™ a salute of twenty guns,
    Anâ€™ we gave to â€™im a doctor for to cure â€™is chills anâ€™ croups;
    With a tutor, anâ€™ a genâ€™ral for to organise â€™is troops.

    So â€™is tutor taught â€™im manners, anâ€™ the way to part â€™is â€™air,
    Anâ€™ the genâ€™ral, in â€™is spare time, taught â€™im proper ways to
            sware;
    The doctor, to complete â€™im, was a-teaching him to millâ€”
    When â€™is â€™ighness put the veto on the Education Bill.

    Then â€™e cheeked the British Consul!
      Then â€™e cussed the doctorâ€™s wife!
    Anâ€™ â€™e chased â€™is good, kind tutor, with a bloominâ€™ carvinâ€™
            knife;
    Tore â€™is books anâ€™ burnt â€™is grammar (said they wasnâ€™t good for
            â€™ealf),
    Boned some whisky from the General, anâ€™ unchristianised â€™isself!

    _So, weâ€™re bound for Oojee-Moojee,_
    _An we musâ€™nâ€™t be detained;_
    _For relations dip-lo-matic_
    _â€™Ave become a trifle strained:_
    _â€™Situations complicatedâ€™â€”_
    _â€™Warship ordered to the scene!â€™â€”_
    _Just because a nigger kiddyâ€™s_
    _Playinâ€™ truant with the Queen!_




                         *THE SONG OF THE TOWN*


    Sing hey! for the sand-freckled plain;
      Sing ho! for the flower-flushed valley;
    A song for the ship-sprinkled main,
      And the sports where the wanderers rally,
    A song for the lawn sloping downâ€”
      The lawn with its terrace and fountain,
    But hereâ€™s a song of the square white Town
      By the mist-wrapped, cloud-capped mountain!

      The whitewashed, square-cut town,
      By the grey-green wind-swept sea;
        The moving throng,
        And the motor gong,
    These sing the song for me!

    Sing hey! for the Town and its folk,
      The comers, the goers, the stayers;
    The just arrived waster, dead-broke,
      The homeward-bound mummers and players;
    The white man suspiciously dark!
      The trooper-man, newly recruited;
    The hand-bagged and frock-coated clerk,
      The pioneer corded and booted!

    The motley-peopled town!
    Its raw and cultured folk,
      Live, work, and play
      â€™Twixt Mount and Bay,
    And bear one equal yoke.

    Sing hey! for the Town, and its dress,
      The garbs of the twenty-one nations:
    The Kafir in blanketâ€”and less,
      The lady in Paris â€™creationsâ€™;
    The-man-about-town, rather loud,
      The nigger in checks somewhat rasher;
    Here, fez to the turban is bowâ€™d,
      There, top-hat comes off to the â€™smasher.â€™

    The particoloured town,
    Where plush and broadcloth meet:
      Where Islamâ€™s green
      And Worth-wrought sheen
    Rub textures in the street!

    Sing hey! for the Town, as a town,
      A song of its bricks and its plaster;
    The slum that is mouldering downâ€”
      The mansion thatâ€™s rising the faster.
    Sing hey! for its one-storied past,
      Be-flagged, and be-stoeped, and be-whitened;
    Its five-storied future more vast,
      Its breadth to be broadened and heightened.

    The grim old, prim old town,
    A brand-new vestment wears,
      And arc-lights purr
      Where blue-gums were,
    And the blanket-Kafir stares!




                            *BY SIMONâ€™S BAY*


    In the mountain fold
    By the green-blue bay,
    Where the waves are flecked
    By the evening gold
    At the close of day;
    And the berg is decked
    With a film of grey,
    And the mountainâ€™s frown
    On the darkening townâ€”
      My memâ€™ries stray.

    By the fringing beach,
    By the restless wave,
    Is the straggling town,
    And its limits reach
    From the highest place
    By the mountainâ€™s crown
    To the mountainâ€™s baseâ€”
    Where the waters lave.

    Hopeful Town
    By the Cape of Hope;
    By the sandy slope
    Where the Hills look down;
    By the wind-swept kloofâ€”
    On the barrack, grim:
    On the whitened roof,
    On the garden trim:
    On the restless Bay
    Where the sea-fowl whirls
    And the spume-dust swirls
    To the Zephyrâ€™s whimâ€”
    At the close of day.

    Darkening Bay,
    Where ever lay
    Alert to slip
    From leashes taut
    A blood-flecked hound
    In the pale lean ship;
    And where the sound
    Of echoing boom
    From far away
    Is a full-mouthed bay,
    As the quarryâ€™s found.
    Mournful bay
    In green and grey,
    Iâ€™ve thought on you
    This many a day.




                              *THE SQUIRE*


      Sir John of the Isles,
      â€™E stood on â€™is lands,
    Anâ€™ looked round â€™is large estates:
    The lands of waste, anâ€™ the lands of corn;
    The rose-clad lands, anâ€™ the lands of thorn;
    Anâ€™ â€™is many gun guarded gates.

      Sir John of the Isles,
      â€™E sez to T.A.,
    â€™E sez to T.A., sez â€™e,
    â€™Oh, you anâ€™ your chum, the sailor-man,
    Must scour the country as far as you can
    For you are gamekeepers to me.â€™

      Sir John of the Isles,
      â€™E sez to the swellsâ€”
    The Downing Street frock-coated crewâ€”
    â€™You are stewards of mine, on Colonial land,
    Anâ€™ my tenants, with seventeen guns anâ€™ a band,
    Shall pay their respects unto you!â€™

      Sez John of the Isles
      To one of the swells,
    â€™Near the lands where youâ€™re goinâ€™ to Be
    Is the dusty estate of a crotchety cuss,
    â€™Oo from time to time causes a great deal of fuss,
    For â€™e thinks â€™eâ€™s better nor me.â€™

      Sez John of the Isles,
      â€™The tenants â€™e rules
    Are a very peculiar lot.
    â€™Is bailifs are â€™Ollanders, chock full of guile,
    Anâ€™ they run the estate in a Guy-foxy style.
    Which is Dynamite, Treason and Plot!â€™

      Sez John of the Isles,
      â€™Donâ€™t mind â€™is remarks,
    For the land which is â€™isâ€”it was mine;
    But â€™e took it to Law in a court rather grim,
    Anâ€™ a kopje-â€™id jury decided for â€™im!
    Anâ€™ awarded the land as a fine.â€™

      Sir John of the Isles,
      â€™E sez to the swell,
    â€™Youâ€™re a gentleman, breedinâ€™ an birth,
    Anâ€™ in case of a row, without losinâ€™ your â€™ead,
    You may take my gamekeepers, anâ€™ mark â€™is land red!
    On the survey-map of the Earth!â€™




                            *THE SEA-NATION*


    We rose, a people of the sea,
      Nursed by the wind, and rocked by wave.
    Our hard, rock-founded history,
      Was born from stories of our brave.
    And northern ice-blasts steeled our frames
    When war was but the best of games.

    We saw a Roman Empire fall,
      And fell; but falling, learned to rise.
    We heard the voice of Progress call,
      And in our folly we were wise:
    When Briton, Saxon, Norman, Dane,
    Bequeathed their progeny the main.

    And conquered joined with conqueror;
      And Norman fire, with Saxon zeal
    Combined; we swept the world before
      The twanging bow, and clanging steel.
    Tyrants unmurmâ€™ring bore our yoke,
    And braggarts thought before they spoke.

    Then Iron Might took Right to wife;
      And lo! our liberty was born!
    We revelled in the newer life
      When King was mated by a pawn.
    Men lived between, of mighty worth;
    From Montfortâ€™s death to Cromwellâ€™s birth.

    We bore the arrogance of kings,
      But bravÃ¨d death in fear of God.
    We rose from great, to greater things.
      The weak grew potent at our nod.
    And nations watched the scales of Fate,
    To see where England threw her weight!

    We took our seed to other climes,
      And from it sprang by divers seas,
    An Oakâ€”that grew among the Limes!
      An Oakâ€”among the Blue-gum trees!
    The Cactus left the land because
    The Acorn brought its ordered laws.

    And like a giant, bearing stings
      Of gnats, who joy to see him wince,
    We standâ€”the envy of the kings
      Despised by every petty prince!
    Who know, that while enduring yet,
    We bearâ€”but we do not forget.

    We lived, and live!  The world shall see
      An inextinguishable flame.
    The nations fade; but we shall be!
      When Gaul and Teuton are a name!
    For us the seven seas in one:
    For landlocked hordesâ€”oblivion.




                             *NATURE FAILS*


      You can easâ€™ly understand
      That the green of medder-land
    Doesnâ€™t strike the bloke that â€™as to push the roller;
      Anâ€™ Nature at the best,
      When you put â€™er to the test,
    Undiluted, is a very poor consoler.

      Anâ€™ the blue of summer skies
      â€™As no beauties for the eyes
    Of defaulters on parade in marchinâ€™ order;
      Anâ€™ the rainiest of morns
      Brings no feelinâ€™sâ€”â€™cept to corns,
    Of a feller pickinâ€™ oakum with a warder.

      Wotâ€™s the beauty of the spot,
      When youâ€™re beinâ€™ drilled with shot?
    Wot is Nature when youâ€™re checked for beinâ€™ dirty?
      Anâ€™ eternityâ€™s a blank
      To a feller on the crank,
    When evâ€™ry blessed minute seems like thirty!

      Beinâ€™ punished for your deeds,
      On fatigâ€™ a-pickinâ€™ weeds,
    Can a bloke admire the beauties of the clover?
      Does the sunset on the â€™ills
      Give defaulters any thrills
    Except to know the day is nearly over.

      Beinâ€™ frog-marched to the clink,
      Does a feller stop to think
    On the grass before â€™is eyes so swifâ€™ly runninâ€™,
      â€™Ow that evâ€™ry single blade
      Is most wonderfully made
    Wiv a skill beyond all artificial cunninâ€™?

      Anâ€™ you cannot pant for wars
      When youâ€™re scrubbinâ€™ barrack floors,
    Or get inspired on bully-beef anâ€™ biscuit:
      It requires a poetâ€™s soul
      When a fellerâ€™s cartinâ€™ coal
    To think â€™isself in danger, anâ€™ to risk it.

      Does a feller care a Dâ€”
      For the friskinâ€™ of a lamb,
    When â€™e â€™as to watch the friskinâ€™ throâ€™ a gratinâ€™?
      Does the lowinâ€™ of the â€™erds,
      Or the twitterinâ€™ of the birds,
    Soothe a feller when for punishment â€™eâ€™s waitinâ€™?


    Lâ€™ ENVOI

      In the deepest pits of â€™Ell,
      Where the worst defaulters dwell
    (Charcoal devils used as fuel as you require â€™em),
      Thereâ€™s some lovely coloured rays,
      Pyrotechnical displays:
    _But you canâ€™t expect the burninâ€™ to admire â€™em!_




                         *THE COLONELâ€™S GARDEN*


    There are gardins, anâ€™ thereâ€™s gardins,
      Some are good, anâ€™ some are not.
    There are gardins in a glass â€™ouse
      Where the air is allus â€™ot.
    But whether on a winder-ledge,
      Or in a flower-pot,
    Iâ€™ll back our Colonelâ€™s gardin
      For to lick the bilinâ€™ lot.

    There are gardners, _anâ€™_ thereâ€™s gardners,
      Some are great, anâ€™ some are small.
    Some could change a bloominâ€™ brickfield
      To a Covent Gardâ€™n ball!
    There are some â€™oo couldnâ€™t â€™ardly
      Fix a creeper to a wall!
    But Iâ€™ll back our Colonelâ€™s gardner,
      Jerry Jordan, â€™gin â€™em all!

    O the flowers they are lovely!
      Anâ€™ the roses they are fair;
    Anâ€™ the daisies they are winkinâ€™
      Throâ€™ a lash of maiden-â€™air!
    Anâ€™ the lilies, tall anâ€™ nakedâ€”
      Thoâ€™ itâ€™s little that they care!
    Anâ€™ the gardenâ€”under Jerryâ€”
      Is a place beyond compare!

    There are flowers bloominâ€™ early,
      There are flowers bloominâ€™ late;
    There is â€™oneysuckle climbinâ€™
      On the porchway, by the gate.

    Thereâ€™s some cress anâ€™ mustard growinâ€™
        On a commissairy plate!
    O the garden it is lovelyâ€”
        Thatâ€™s when Jerryâ€™s on the straight!

      *      *      *      *      *

    O the garden itâ€™s neglected.
        Anâ€™ the pinks â€™ave ceased to pink,
    Anâ€™ the petals they are droppinâ€™,
        Anâ€™ the blooms they bend and sink.
    O the flowers they are fadinâ€™
        Now that Jerryâ€™s took to drink!
    O the flowers theyâ€™re neglectedâ€”
        Jerry Jordanâ€™s in the clink!

    For the flowers will not blossom,
        Anâ€™ they donâ€™t give out no smells,
    The convulâ€™vus it is weepinâ€™
        From its verigated bells.
    Anâ€™ the lilyâ€™s in hysterics,
        Anâ€™ she faints away in spells:
    O thereâ€™s weepinâ€™, anâ€™ thereâ€™s wailinâ€™â€”
        Jerry Jordanâ€™s doinâ€™ cells!

      *      *      *      *      *

    O the path is rolled anâ€™ gravelled,
        Anâ€™ the gardinâ€™s fresh as rain,
    Anâ€™ the weeds that strewed the borders
        They no longer there remain.
    Anâ€™ the flowers they are smilinâ€™,
        For theyâ€™re out of all their pain;
    Anâ€™ the bees they â€™um for gladnessâ€”
        Jerry Jordanâ€™s out again!




                   *THE PEOPLE TO CECIL JOHN RHODES,*

                             JULY 18, 1899


    By the bond that binds the scattered folk to home,
      We have come.
    By the love to dear old England which you bearâ€”
      And we share,
    By the knowledge of the Empire you extendâ€”
      Britainâ€™s friend!â€”
    We are gathered, many thousand people, to
      Welcome you!

    We are strangers drawn together by one tie,
      They and I,
    Merely men who, having never met before,
      Meet no more!
    But a common cause has bridged the social breach,
      Each to each
    Has one soft word of fellowship to say,
      Here to-day.

    If you search among our numbers you will find
      Every kind:
    Dutchman, Briton, â€™Africander,â€™ and Malay
      In array;
    Christian, Mussulman, and he of Abramâ€™s seedâ€”
      Every creed:
    With the worshippers of _Sakyanumiâ€™s_ mudâ€”
      Mighty Budh.

    But if every heart was melted, and when done
      Moulded oneâ€”
    If a welcome in a polyglotic tongue
      Could be sungâ€”
    If one voice could speak our sentiments to-day,
      We would say,
    Very simply: â€™We are glad that you are comeâ€”
      Welcome home!â€™

    We have followed you, and watched your noble stand
      For your land.
    And your triumphs and your greatly troubled hours.
      Have been ours:
    And our sympathetic wishes for your cause,
      Have been yours:
    Since the day on which you left us to go forth,
      â€™For my North!â€™

    We have followed you through many foreign ways,
        In these days.
    By the Nilus, on the Desert, new surveyed,
        You have strayed:
    By the Pyramids and palms of Cairo town,
        Parched and brown:
    By the quiet shades of Oxford, prim and green,
      You have been.

    In the stately city hall, in spirit we
      Came to see
    The cheering thousands testify belief,
      In their Chief.
    In the regal courts of Potsdam, at your side
      We were tied,
    By the tighter bond than kinship ever drewâ€”-
      We and you!

    If our hearts in concord melted and were run
      Into one!
    If a welcome in a polyglotic tongue.
      Could be sung:
    If two words could voice our sentiments to-day,
      We would sayâ€”
    Very simply, being glad that you are comeâ€”
      â€™Welcome home!â€™




                          *WHEN LONDON CALLS!*


    Thereâ€™s a voice that calls to Mecca, thereâ€™s a voice that calls
            to Rome.
    (O the Holiest of Holies!  O the Temple and the Shrine!)
    Thereâ€™s a bleating from a pasture, and it calls a wandâ€™rer home.
    (O the friskings of the yearlings, and the lowing of the kine!)
    Thereâ€™s a penetrating whisper that can rise above the gale
    From the cot of thatch and plaster, from the oaken-gabled hall,
    From the limpid lake of silver in the verdant velvet vale,
    From the shamrock and the heather,
      Hear the call!

    Thereâ€™s a voice that calls the waster, when the doors of home
            are shut.
    (O the voice of club and chamber, and the arc-light burning
            blue!)
    Thereâ€™s a voice that calls the trooper in his daub and wattle
            hut.
    (O the midnight cabs that rattle from the Strand to Waterloo!)
    Thereâ€™s a voice for ever calling from the Square and from the
            Slum,
    From the Hornsey Rise to Brixton, from St. Saviourâ€™s to St.
            Paulâ€™s.
    â€™Tis the never-changing message of the everlasting â€™Comeâ€™
    To the brick and to the mortar.
      London calls!

    You may still the voice of conscience, and suppress the blush of
            shame.
    (O the deed that made you outlaw!  O the folly and the sin!)
    But never man ignored it when the call to London came.
    (The call from belfry tower!  O the clanging, banging din!)
    â€™Tis the wooded green of Greenwich with the deer among the fern.
    â€™Tis the bleak, blank streets of Lambeth, where the
      drizzling fog-mist falls.
    Itâ€™s a weary aching whisper, and it murmurs, â€™O return
    To the Elegance, the Squalor.
      London calls!â€™

    â€™Tis the swelling roar of Epsom, with the backers seven deep.
    (O the rush around the Corner, and the finish on the Straight!)
    â€™Tis the tinkling hum of Henley as it snuggles down to sleep.
    (O the light-lined laughing river, with its fairy-fancied fÃ©te!)
    â€™Tis the growl of Ratcliffe Highway, â€™tis the lisp of Rotten
            Row;
    â€™Tis the beauty that entrances, â€™tis the horror that appals;
    â€™Tis the firemenâ€™s horses tearing to the midnight sky aglow;
    Itâ€™s a vague and restlessâ€”something.
      London calls!

    It is early morning Fleet Street, when the throbbing presses
            fly.
    (O the Father of the Chapel!  O the ticking, talking tape!)
    â€™Tis the universal High Street, where the world may see and buy.
    (O the steamboat of Newcastle!  O the feather of the Cape!)
    â€™Tis the heart of all creation, where the veins of commerce
            meet;
    â€™Tis the centre seat in gallâ€™ry, â€™tis the booked and numbered
            stalls;
    â€™Tis the barrow in Whitechapel, â€™tis the brougham in Regent
            Street;
    â€™Tis the Commonplaceâ€”the Novel.
      London calls!

    â€™Tis the glitter and the jingle on the Foreign Office stairs.
    (O the starred and gartered Levee!  O the Rulers of the Land!)
    â€™Tis the crowd about the stretcher and the burden that it bears.
    (O the ward in darkened silence!  O the swiftly running sand!)
    â€™Tis the message of the letter, â€™tis the message of the wire;
    â€™Tis the dainty hand that types it, â€™tis the awkward fist that
            scrawls;
    â€™Tis the memory that sickens, â€™tis the thought that burns â€™like
            fire;
    â€™Tis the life thatâ€™s worth the living!
      London calls!

    â€™Tis the cheering of the Commons and the cry of â€™Who goes home?â€™
    (O the bell that rings Division!  O the seat beneath the card!)
    â€™Tis the choir-boysâ€™ voices rising to the lofty, painted dome.
    (O the flutter of the pigeons in the flagged and mossy yard!)
    â€™Tis the Sabbath bells that echo down the silent city streets;
    â€™Tis the Steel inside the Velvet!  â€™Tis the stroking hand that
            mauls!
    â€™Tis the Tutor, itâ€™s the Master.  It prepares and it completes!
    It is Londonâ€”and itâ€™s LONDON!
      And it calls!




                              *CAIROWARDS*


    Going upâ€”and by all one manâ€™s will!
      Untrodden lands shall echo with our roars,
    Our enginesâ€™ wheels shall break the mountainsâ€™ still,
      Uncharted rivers see us by their shores;
    And where the lions drink, and panthers prey,
    Shall lie the ballast of our iron-bound way.

    Going up!  PrimÃ¦val forest, where
      The Bushman lurks with poison at his lips,
    Must give its best, and all its treasures bare,
      When our iron-monster in its hollows dips;
    And caves, from which the cobra issues forth,
    Shall be a Somewhere Junctionâ€”for the North.

    Going up!  Eternal snows, that crown
      The lonely summits of the lordly hills,
    Shall look upon our laboured paths, and frown
      Upon the girdered bridge that spans their rills;
    But, clinging to the slope, with scanty hold,
    The road shall be unfastened, fold by fold.

    Going up!  The stifling winds that blow
      Across the sweep of fiery desert waste
    Shall clog and cloy our workings as we go,
      And strive to check us in our despâ€™rate haste,
    With sand that holds us in its shifting clutchâ€”
    And iron and brass shall blister to the touch.

    Going up!  The Nile in sullen wrath
      Shall rise and smite the sleeper from the rail,
    And say: â€™Behold the Mistress of the North!
      Who does not let the work of man prevail!â€™
    But patient man shall strive against her might
    Until the palms of Cairo are in sight!




                    *ODE TO THE OPENING OF THE SOUTH
                       AFRICAN EXHIBITION, 1898*


    Father of all!
    RobÃ¨d in splendour,
    Thou who dost wield
    Almighty power,
    All things are thine,
    Fruitage and flowerâ€”
    Cattle and kineâ€”
    Vineyard and field!
    Hear, when we call.
    Praising the Sender!

    Father of all!
    Strong to deliver!
    Here, do we place,
    Down at Thy feet,
    Fruits of our handsâ€”
    Trophies of wheat,
    Won from Thy landsâ€”
    Trophies of chase.
    Hear, when we call,
    Praising the Giver!

    Father of all!
    Weaver and fuller;
    Craftsman and herd;
    Chapman and knave;
    Worker and drone;
    Headman and slave,
    Worship a-proneâ€”
    Bow to Thy word!
    Hear Thou our call,
    Praising the Ruler!

    Father of all!
    Billow and breaker
    Sink to Thy nod!
    Here, have we brought,
    That which we found,
    That which we wrought,
    Drawn from Thy ground,
    Culled from Thy sod.
    Hear, when we call,
    Praising the Maker!

    Father of all!
    Thine is the story
    Written in space!
    What Thou hast made
    Knows not of death.
    Let us not fade,
    Catching Thy breath,
    Live by Thy grace!
    Hear Thou our call,
    Thine is the Glory!
