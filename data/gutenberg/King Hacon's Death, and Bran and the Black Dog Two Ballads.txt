KING HACON‚ÄôS DEATH


And now has happened in our day
   What was in ancient time foretold:
Beneath his hand all Norroway‚Äôs land
   Has Hacon brought, the wise and bold.

Full many a warrior summons he
   From all the country far and near;
To Scotland‚Äôs realm, with shield and helm,
   Across the sea the King will steer.

As many as sword and helm can bear
   With him must sail across the foam;
All of fit age must follow their liege,
   Those who are not may tarry at home.

It was Hacon, Norroway‚Äôs King,
   Survey‚Äôd the gallant band with pride:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm missing one‚Äîmy Andfindson,
   O where does Olaf the stripling bide?‚Äù

Then answer‚Äôd him the little footboy,
   Not far that stood from the Monarch‚Äôs knee:
‚ÄúOlaf, my Lord, will come on board
   As soon as weigh‚Äôd the anchors be.‚Äù

Then out they stood from Bergen town,
   And out from Bergen‚Äôs mole, I trow;
Silk is the sail they spread in the gale,
   Painted with blue is the deck below.

‚ÄúNow Magnus hear, my son so dear,
   At home I tell thee thou must stay:
Aarhus to ward and Bergen to guard,
   For the keys of Norroway‚Äôs land are they.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen all dearest father mine,
   Recall thy word I entreat of thee;
To rule rough earls and Norroway churls
   Too ignorant far and too young I be.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen clothe thee straight and clothe thee well,
   Since thou wilt follow me, my child:
But much I fear thou can‚Äôst not bear
   The toss of the sea and its billows wild.‚Äù

So out they stood from Bergen town,
   And ‚Äôtwas at fall of evening grey;
The folk on the shore they griev‚Äôd full sore
   As that brave armament sail‚Äôd away.

And when they came to Lindeness,
   And the mounting billow the sail bespray‚Äôd,
In the breeze so fair the ship stood there
   As though to the bottom it fast were made.

Then said the King as he lean‚Äôd upon
   His trusty faulchion‚Äôs hilt of gold:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm here in the dark, is there any clerk
   Or layman here can this thing unfold?‚Äù

Then out spoke Nilaus Noderness,
   As a glance he flung upon the deep:
‚ÄúDoom‚Äôd men on board, have we my Lord,
   The truth from thee I cannot keep.‚Äù

It was our Norroway Hacon then
   Thereat so sorely troubled grew:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm missing one, my Andfindson,
   Why meets not Olaf his father‚Äôs view?‚Äù

Then answer‚Äôd him the little footboy,
   As apart he stood from the Norway King:
‚ÄúBeneath the deck lies Olaf sick,
   And much I fear he‚Äôs suffering.‚Äù

It was Hacon the Norway King
   To visit Olaf with speed he goes:
‚ÄúWhat cheer, what cheer, my Olaf dear?
   Thy state to thy father straight disclose.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel no rest within my breast,
   Methinks my very heart will rend:
Would God, the King of all, would bring
   This horrible night to a speedy end.‚Äù

They watched o‚Äôer Olaf Andfindson,
   They watched o‚Äôer Olaf long nights twain;
And Hacon I say, of Norroway,
   By watching thus his death did gain.

It was Olaf Andfindson,
   He yielded up his gentle sprite;
‚ÄôTwas Hacon grey of Norroway
   Before him held the big wax light.

O then King Hacon distrest he grew,
   The stripling‚Äôs corse he would not leave:
He pin‚Äôd away and sick he lay,
   His hoary Counsellors how they grieve.

‚ÄúCheer up,‚Äù they said.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve fought and bled,
   And almost won these foreign shores;
But if thou now from us should‚Äôst go
   A sad and dreary fate were ours.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy time is come, I can‚Äôt survive;
   Write ye my testament, I pray,
When I am gone do ye see done
   What with my dying breath I say:

‚ÄúMy son, King Magnus, I advise
   Ever the law of God to heed;
Justice above all things to love,
   And well, full well, with him ‚Äôtwill speed.

‚ÄúPriests and widows let him defend,
   And his reign, I trow, will not be brief;
The outlaw crew let him pursue,
   And hang unpitying every thief.

‚ÄúThese are the first things I request,
   And now I‚Äôll crave another thing;
Ye‚Äôll bury me with my ancestry
   In our Lady‚Äôs Church as beseems your King.‚Äù

To Bergen‚Äôs shore came tidings o‚Äôer
   Which made the hearts of the dauntless faint:
‚ÄúHacon is dead, our regal head,
   Relation near to Olaf Saint.‚Äù

In Orkney isle expir‚Äôd the King,
   On a Thursday morning that befell;
‚ÄôTwas Pentecost when the King they lost,
   The mighty King whom they lov‚Äôd so well.

From high Kirkwall now sail‚Äôd they all,
   And to Bergen o‚Äôer their course they ply;
They laid in grave the Monarch brave,
   In the spot where the Monarch wish‚Äôd to lie.

A braver heart ne‚Äôer play‚Äôd a part,
   And never shone in Minstrel‚Äôs lay;
No King on earth can vie in worth
   With Hacon the Good of Norroway.




BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG


The day we went to the hills to chase
   Of dogs we had a brave company;
There heard we the songs of the feather‚Äôd race,
   The blare of the elk, and the roebuck‚Äôs cry.

In the hills we had no common sport,
   With our dogs and our arms many deer we slew;
When at noon we return‚Äôd to our silvan court,
   We were a well-pleas‚Äôd, laughing crew.

That night the house of the Fenian king
   With a band of joyous guests was fill‚Äôd;
The manner we sang, whilst we plied the string,
   In which the buck and the elk we kill‚Äôd.

The valiant Finn arose next day,
   Just as the sun rose above the foam;
And he beheld up the Lairgo way,
   A man clad in red with a black dog come.

I‚Äôll tell ye what was the stranger‚Äôs mien:
   His complexion was that of the strawberrie;
White as the canach was his skin,
   Though black his hair, as black could be.

He came up with a lofty gait,
   Said not for shelter he sought our doors;
And wanted neither drink nor meat,
   But would match his dog ‚Äôgainst the best of ours.

We brought ‚Äôgainst that of the stranger youth
   The very best dogs within our bounds;
But the stranger dog had a desperate tooth,
   And quickly despatch‚Äôd for us fifty hounds.

A strange fight this, the great Finn said,
   As he turn‚Äôd his face towards his clan;
Then his face with rage grey fiery red,
   And he struck with his fist his good dog Bran.

Bran look‚Äôd at his master with much surprise,
   That his master should strike him surprise he felt‚Äî
‚ÄúI could hew from the shoulder the hand,‚Äù Finn cries,
   ‚ÄúWith which my dog that blow I dealt.‚Äù

Then Bran he shook his collar of gold,
   The mountains echoed with his bay;
His terrible eyes like fire-balls roll‚Äôd,
   And his mind was bent upon canine fray.

‚ÄúTake off from his neck the collar of gold,
   Not right for him now such a thing to bear;
And a free good fight we shall behold
   Betwixt my dog and his black compeer.‚Äù

Now a likeness I‚Äôll draw of my good dog Bran:
   His head was cover‚Äôd with shaggy hair,
His breast was broad and its colour tan,
   His houghs were crook‚Äôd, his quarters square.

Four yellow feet had he I ween,
   His sides were black but his belly fair;
A tinge of green on his back was seen,
   Of blood-red ears he‚Äôd a pointed pair.

The dogs their noses together placed,
   Then their blood was scatter‚Äôd on every side;
Desperate the fight, and the fight did last
   ‚ÄôTill the brave black dog in Bran‚Äôs gripe died.

‚ÄúO sure was I,‚Äù did Ossian cry,
   From the pillar of the dogs with stern delight,
‚ÄúThere was no dog in the Finn country
   Could inflict upon Bran the mortal bite.

‚ÄúO Bran was a stag-hound Morong bred,
   And possess‚Äôd each canine guile and sleight;
There was no dog in leash e‚Äôer led
   Could consign our dog to the Western height.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs many a damsel, heavenly bright,
   With azure eye and yellow hair,
In the land of the son of King Torc this night
   Would be proud with my dog her supper to share.‚Äù

A grave the valiant hero made
   For his good black dog in the field‚Äôs green breast;
Full fifty dogs the Fenians laid
   To the pibroch‚Äôs blast in the hill to the west.

We went to the dwelling of high MacCuol,
   With the king to drink, and dice, and throw;
The king was joyous, his hall was full,
   Though empty and dark this night I trow.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
