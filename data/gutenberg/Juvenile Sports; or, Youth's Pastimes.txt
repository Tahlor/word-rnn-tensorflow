                             [Illustration]

                  Would you either skate, or slide,
                  Ever Oh! of falls beware,
                  Pain often, stands by pleasures side
                  Broken heads, are skaiters fare.

                             [Illustration]

               The Bear is in a surly mood,
               I, should not like him in a wood,
               Then buffet him, if you advance,
               But mind, this knot, shall make you dance.

                             [Illustration]

                 Come, trundle now your Hoops, my boys,
                 And drive them quick along,
                 While each his favorite sport enjoys,
                 Amidst the jovial throng.

                             [Illustration]

                 The little Vessel spreads all sail,
                 Swift wafted by the gentle gale,
                 And as she glides along the stream,
                 Their eager eyes, with pleasure beam.

                             [Illustration]

                 High bounding like the nimble deer
                 At Leapfrog, blithesome boys appear
                 While health gives vigour to the frame
                 And fits them for the active game.

                             [Illustration]

                 With bat and trap, the Youthâ€™s agreâ€™d
                 To send the ball abroad with speed,
                 While eager with his open hands,
                 To catch him out, his playmate stands.

                             [Illustration]

                  This Boy with spirit, whips his top,
                  And makes it circling, spin and hop,
                  Then out of breath, he sits awhile,
                  To rest him from the pleasing toil.

                             [Illustration]

                 The Kite majestic soars on high,
                 In various gambols, throâ€™ the sky,
                 Deckâ€™d out with stars and colors gay,
                 Upon the schoolboys holiday.

                             [Illustration]

                  The time for playing Top is in,
                  By Proclamation, let them spin,
                  To drive the counter, to its bound,
                  Upon the smooth enamellâ€™d ground.

                             [Illustration]

                  The Pins in even order stand,
                  Like ranks of soldiers, in a band,
                  And many a Youth before his prime,
                  Is fellâ€™d, by that arch bowlerâ€”Time.

                             [Illustration]

               Now each regardless of a fall,
               With crooked stick, oft strikes the ball,
               Which oâ€™er the icy surface flies,
               The adventrâ€™us game, with ardour plies.
