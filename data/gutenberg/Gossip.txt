Foreward
The two Monas, whose joint name has confused Gossip readers 
these long years, have finally come out on the Canadian scene 
as the two distinct people they are - Mona Gould, the poet, 
whose verse has charmed and intrigued, and Mona Clark, the editor, 
who brought this verse to Gossip's pages.

The two Monas hope that this collection has all the poems 
you have liked best. 

Sincerely,
Mona Clark

Apple Orchard 


White as popcorn, was the tree 
And underneath it on the lea
A little goat looked up at me.

Bright and wicked was his glance 
In that orchard's sweet expanse
In a mocking sort of dance 
Moved his hooves.

He was Pan, and he was Spring 
With a sudden saucy spring 
Off he flew . . .
Just a shadow in the air . . . 
Was he really ever there?




For all Ear-Pinners 


There are some people
Who delight
In pinning people's ears 
Back tight.
I'd love to be on hand 
That day
When things work out 
The other way!




To Snow ... or Not to Snow! 


Feather down soft deep snow
Feather down . . . I implore you. 
The part of me that's Poet 
Simply adores you!
The part of me that's "working girl"
Equally abhors you!
Snow is like thistledown 
Filigree-ing trees:
But waiting for street cars . . . 
It's wet ankles and
Knees!




Counsel


Heart, be very cautious now 
Remember . . . once before 
Love was like a bright room . . . 
Then a slammed door!




In a Fit of Pique


If you have not learned to give proudly 
Do not prate to me of "love"!
There are those, who as children 
Clutch tight the bottom, of the candy-bag 
Saying "Help yourself"
But making very sure 
The gift is limited.
These children grow up to be 
Stingy lovers.
I have no patience with them! 




It Doesn't Matter 


It doesn't matter much to me 
About a person's family tree 
Or what his special vices are 
Or if he drives a custom car
Or if his Clubs are old and formal 
As long as he is nice and normal! 




Sherry


Sherry . . . twinkling in a little glass 
Warm as snared sunlight
A pool of golden light
To make a flight of dreams. 
(I can see your eyes
Twinkling back at the Sherry. 
Merry as all "get out"!)
Even when I am a very ancient lady 
And the decanter goes round
I shall remember you with a sweet shock . . .
I'll be bound!



Last of the Line 


Ah, primitive and hardy
Our fathers were . . . of old . . . 
But even on my brightest days
I can't quite shower . . . cold!




Teen Age


They talk of sooper dooper things
And wear each other's pins and rings. 
They swim and dance and ski and smoke 
And get a bang from lemon coke.

Play records . . . speak of Dizz and Duke 
And dance wherever there's a Juke. 
Chameleon-like, they change and vary 
And suddenly grow up . . . and marry!




Top Toad 


He always said:
"I'd rather be dead
Than be a small toad in a big puddle.
I like the huddle and power I have in a small town" . . .
Then, (with a black frown)
"I prefer to be a big toad in a little puddle"!
The only thing that struck you
As you watched his steam-roller tactics down his narrow road
He'd somehow . . . begun to resemble his own model . . .
The big toad!




War Weary 


Some ladies love to sleep alone 
In solitary state
Chaste . . . unruffled and serene: 
This . . . I . . . hate! 




Ice-Steria


Whenever it is "three below" 
I wish myself in Mexico
Or dancing with a Hottentot
Or anywhere where I am not! 




Aftermath 


After holiday food
I feel so hell-ry 
I long to subsist On tea and cel'ry!




Moot Question


Why is it
When the wind blows 
I get a red nose
Some gals get all dewy-eyed
And fresh . . . and sort of 
  "jeune fille"
You should see me!




Lunch Hour


The conversation murmurs in a steady "thrum"
With little quick arpeggios 
Of treble laughter.
The tables are arranged 
In precisely
The same order. 
Nothing is changed 
Save the day . . . and the year . . . 
And the certain knowledge
You'll not be here!
Fair Warning
It may be wisdom, dearest man, 
To subjugate me while you can. 
Because some day I do intend
To seek the roadway's farthest end.




Witch


"I'll put a little 'hex' on you
To make your drinks a bitter brew 
If you forget me!"
This, I vowed 
And all you did 
Was laugh aloud. 

"Perched on an ice cube 
In your glass
I'll scowl and say;
"A pretty pass!
To snatch a lady's heart ... and run . . . 
Egad! me lad! It isn't done!"
Silly of me, my Sweet, to taunt you 
With childish threats of how I'd haunt you!
But still . . . I tell you, if I could
O darling heart . . . of course I would! 




Ballet Moment


Color, that is like the diffusion 
Of the bronze gong
And little tinkling cymbals. 
Highlight on hands and cheekbones 
Flying Oriental brow
Smooth hair!

Points . . . piquant as almond buds
Costumes like Chinese lanterns 
Swaying . . .
Belling in . . . and out.
Pity sleep in the curve of her palms
Anger in the thrust of her shoulders. 
This is a mask
Come to life 
And dancing!




Brave Voyage 


Come, my Sweet
Let us walk in the sleet
(If you can keep your feet!) 

Creep like a couple of snails 
Clinging to rails
When all else fails.
Poets have sung of walking in rain, 
Or even snow . . .
Fain would I go in the sleet . . . 
(If you can keep your feet!)




Ultimatum


Another blizzard and 
Well . . . I Warn Yuh 
I'm off like a streak To California!




Black Coffee 


Smiling sweetly, respected trulls 
Drinking coffee from polished skulls.
A touch of arsenic, "One lump, or two?" 
And the cups go round with their deadly brew.
The Atomic Bomb is an awesome thing
But so is woman . . .
Gossipping!




Sufficient Reason 


I prostitute my Art
Because it's tactical; 
For starving in a garret 
Isn't practical!




His Mistress is Heard Singing 


"I long to turn to you and say:
Hullo my Darling. . . 
How was your day" 
What did you do
And who did you meet
And what was the 'to-do' 
Down the street?"
These are the little 
The darling things 
That go together 
With wedding rings!




Wide World


O when you lock your doors each night 
You either shut the world outside
Or else your own four walls enfold 
A planet twice as far and wide! 

Tsk! Tsk! Mister Santa!
If Santa Claus comes down my chimney 
This year
And puts sooty big foot marks 
All over my white hearth rug 
I'm going to give him What for! 

Last year
He not only knocked half the ornaments off the tree,
And generally bunged things up,
But he insisted on putting beer bottle tops 
In the twins' stockings
Instead of the annual quarter.
If Santa Claus comes down my chimney 
This year
And doesn't mind his "p's" and "q's" . . . 
I'll send him off to bed
And finish the job myself! 




Sorcery


What is this shock of sweet delight 
That puts all sober thoughts to flight 
On hearing someone speak your name 
This little candle in my heart
That glows and burns and warms each part
Of day and night. This friendly thing 
That stirs in me till I must sing.
Your look and voice, the enchanting way 
You pin a flower on my day! 




Everywoman Song


O some men are married to gorgons 
Who swallow them at one swallow, 
And some are married to frigidaires 
And dwell in an icy hollow.
And some there arc, that are bound in chains
As golden as they can be
But you're the luckiest one of all
For Darling . . . you've just got me! 




Sung in High Dudgeon! 


I'd like to be the deadly type
Who plunge the knife . . . before they wipe
The previous victim's flowing gore 
From off the blade. Sad to relate I seem to be
The victim! ... A chicken-hearted sort of thing
I've no desire for "skewering" 
My fellow man.
But by observing I may learn
To give that rapier lightning turn! 




Wise Child


To sing to you would be absurd. 
You'd not believe a single word! 
To touch you would be madder still, 
And so I sit and fill . . . and fill 
My eyes with looking. Like a child 
Who sees an iced cake,
But knows from sad experience
The tummy ache!




Women are Like That 


"Here, in the drift of the dunes" he said, 
"Turn your head"!
"Now the curve of your throat is a troubling song
Your face is a flower, dreaming and white, 
My heart cries out in the rapturous night. 
Give me your lips and your heart", said he, 
But she shook her head . . . emphatically! 
"Gee, but you're sweet!", the other said, 
And tilted back her little head 
Appreciatively.
He didn't call her "fairest one",
She didn't mind ... or think it queer ... 
But looked on him, adoringly,
And whispered . . . 
"O my Dearest Dear"! 




Tea-Party


They get their heads together, 
The honeyed malice drips. 
And all the gentler little wives 
Get out their blacksnake whips. 

It's such a pleasant pastime 
The hours simply fly.
Before they know it's time to go 
But who will make the try
O who will have the fortitude 
To rise and first depart
Knowing full well the hungry horde 
Is dining on her heart!




Hobson's Choice


Life is a rose
And life is a thistle -
And life is the screech of a steamboat's whistle
But nevertheless - if you asked the Dead 
They'd probably choose to be in your bed! 




Letter from Paris 


You write of Paris like a man 
Telling of the woman he loves. 
There is love in the lines that draw the city under rain;
The higgeldy-piggeldy garrets
That climb crazily against the tender pink of the sky;
Montmartre, with the cafÃ©s, just as you'd read they'd be!
Everything just as glamorous . . . just as exciting
A gay ... a mocking . . . a shining, shimmering place
A feminine city!
Your regret at leaving Paris
Is like parting from a woman. 
Paris has wounded you
With her loveliness! 




Conjecture


Why should I think of you 
As a Perewinkle?
Retired . . .
Out of sight in your shell . . . 
Safe!
I wonder what would happen 
If once again in your lifetime 
Someone, armed with a sharp pin, 
Pricked you into the daylight?




Time Was


When you were here, life did not run 
In prim and ordered placid rows
The sky was full of spinning stars 
And laughter danced upon its toes! 




"Track"!


This is release;
This, the sloughing off of the outer husk; 
The spruces lean
To clutch you in a green embrace;
But your spirit has already outstripped them
Flying in arrowy rhythm 
Round a sudden turn In the ski trail!




Travellers


We traveled down a grassy road
O sweet it was to wander!
And parted at the forks of it 
And this is what I ponder: 
Would it have been a braver thing 
For us to stay together,
In spite of any single thing . . . 
Against whatever weather?




Ailurophile


When neighbours' cats begin to yowl and yammer
You always want to hit them with a hammer!
But when your own puts on this spring display
You almost always wonder "Should we spay?" ...
Or "Shall we add another to our flock 
And just have kittens, all around the clock"?
O isn't it a thing both true and queer 
That one cat's "calling" falling on the ear 
Is troublesome . . . a noisome imposition 
While with your cat it's just his disposition, 
And all his other graces far outnumber 
The yearly Spring nocturnal break of slumber!




Word to the Wise 


Little lady never pray
A ring of gold to wear
Lest you find it in your nose -
Much to your despair!




Results


I have never asked for much 
From this world's anointed: 
Strange to say from day to day 
I've not been disappointed!




Why?


The lady 'neath the smallest hat 
Is often very short and fat;
While "slivers", slick and very tall 
Wear cartwheels, like a parasol!




Aspiration


I'd like to be a critic
But one who didn't write
Then, when I gouged their eyes out 
They couldn't turn and bite!




Island Parting (Muskoka) 


How hard it is to say "good-by" to an Island,
Rising tall, with its trees out of clear water
Tawny in the shallows.
Here, white birches bare their shining bones
To summer moonlight;
And one blue heron lifts himself with terrible beauty
Into the evening.
I cannot say why Islands do this to me. 
I only know that putting out into the open gap
Bound for the Mainland
Is like loosing hands with one you love 
Too much!




Photogenic


It must be nice to be photogenic; 
To not have to get in to a panic 
When you "see the birdie".
To just sit there . . . smug . . . 
While they snap your mug. 
And to know you'll look like 
Garbo . . . or Hedy Lamarr
In the finished photo. 
Not . . . Mr. Moto! 




Salad Bar 


There's nothing sadder in this world 
Than stale stuffed celery, over-curled! 




In The Swim


O to be a Petty gal
Now that summer's here,
With thigh and breast and tawny crest 
And slick and stream-lined "rear"
To lounge against the gilded sands 
As in a billboard ad
While some Adonis, thick of neck, 
A great athletic cad
Leans over one with tender sigh 
And whispers soft and low
"The Company who made your suit 
Designed these trunks, you know"! 




Adversary


She stuck her little hat pin in 
And gave a practiced twist.
The only thing that saves my pride 
On someone with a tougher hide 
She'll break her little wrist!




Traitor


You said my face 
Was like a mask 
A little white unstirred expanse 
Where no emotion came to dance. 

You said my eyes were secret eyes 
That wore a mocking shy disguise. 

You said, "No matter how you try 
Your mouth betrays you, by and by?"




Sheepskin


An education used to be 
A thing of strict gentility 
With Classics solid as a rock 
And stresses laid on culture talk. 
Now . . . when he graduates - a man 
Must just make money with Ã©lan!




Alien


O I am homesick every day 
For places I shall never stay. 
For tinkling bells in Samarkand 
Where shadows weave a saraband, 
And London streets and Paris nights 
And O a thousand warm delights
In places strange and far from here 
And . . . (naturellement) doubly dear! 




Cameo


I can't insult my heart again 
By crying over gentlemen. 
But rather trot it out to tea 
With ladies of gentility,
Whose talk and bread sliced neat and thin
Will lift me from the straits I'm in! 




Renegade


Part of me is sad as sad
And part of me is glad as glad. 
Part of me is pure as pure,
And part of me . . . I'm not so sure. 
At odds within myself I be,
And blame it on my Family Tree! 




Mask


You may make your mouth up 
Scarlet as a courtesan's . . . 
Thin sophistication
Lurks in scarlet paint
Even masked in satire 
Still your eyes betray you 
Playing tarnished lady 
Funny little saint!




If This be Good ...


If this be good
Then it shall last 
Far past the rasp Of Sexton's spade . . .
Far past the snow of winter laid 
On sleeping garden;
Some part of this will still endure 
On Time's wide stream;
Some single sure enchanted moment 
Caught up in space will shine forever. 
And in my heart I'm very sure
Which little moment will endure! 




Disenchanted


They always say, "Be good, sweet child 
And let who will ... be clever".
But does this course pay dividends?
I answer . . . hardly ever!




Figment


It's snowing feathers to-day. 
Bits of maribou
From some very frivolous angel's 
Bed-Jacket!




Unbiased Comment 


Small furry creatures part with life 
To deck each plutocratic wife.
And many a tender throat is wrapt 
In silky softness someone trapped. 
I don't condemn this savage rite 
Nor wince to see the endless sight 
Of lovely ladies wrapt in fur . . . 
Egad! I only wish I were!




Venomous Woman 


She has avaricious fingers
On which there lingers
The bitter scent of almonds. 
Poisonous woman!
How her nails
Glitter in the candlelight. 
Only her eyes
Suddenly tear you apart. 
There is a look in them
Of one who gazed on death 
And found it
Beautiful!




Bookshops 


Bookshops have a lovely smell
Sweet and sour . . . heaven and hell. 
Dust and mould, and something magic, 
Laughter, cheek by jowl with tragic 
Songs the Muses used to sing . . .
I love bookshops, in the spring! 




Powder Room 


At every little crystal square
Grave women creatures sit and stare 
At what the day has done to mar 
Frail personal beauty; puff and jar 
And lip rouge tubes are taken out
To dye each thoughtful waiting pout; 
No hurried smear . . . a careful rite 
Then infinite scansion in the light. 
The final look, 
The little smile 
Triumphant . . . careful . . . full of guile 
Absorbed completely in her task
Each "Eve" adjusts her powdered mask! 




Bend Your Head


Bend your head and kiss my hand 
And tell me tales of Samarkand. 
Weave a web of lovely words
That I may count like singing birds 
That I may set upon my sill
When you have left me . . . As you will!




Promise


I shall not weep when you go 
But don a scarlet dress
And I shall sing a gay song 
And you shall never guess. 

And I shall dance when you go 
With other eager men
And make my heart forget you . . . 
And you shall want me, then! 




Remnant


You promised me Fidelity.
I got a ring -
I got a vow -
And now . . . 
I got a ring!




Aware


I hope I never quite get over 
The smell of rainy summer clover; 
Or how a willow tree at night 
Can make a silver sort of light; 
Or how a child with lifted face 
Can make a holy sort of place!




Out of Loneliness ... 


Out of a loneliness more deep 
Than quiet death. 
Out of a sleep 
As cold as ice . . . more drear, more chill 
I hunger up toward dreaming;
Fill my hands with flowers,
Tread a measure against bright candles, 
Bare my throat to Autumn moonlight 
Cry to the stars that love rides by 
Against whatever midnight sky!




Chalk Talk


Sometimes I tell myself
"Chumley! It's about time you acquired a little dignity.
Not much. 
Just a touch. 
Take to wearing a hat 
And the like of that. 
Quit enjoying the society of youth in the formative stage
In other words . . . "Act your age"!
I've gone into this subject with myself before
But it's such a bore!
I know what will come of it.
One day they'll be saying 
"What a silly old person she is . . . 
Flighty . . .
Maybe touched in the head" . . . 
And will my face be red!
But I fancy in the final analysis 
We follow our natural bent.
So I shan't relent. 
Dignity comes to us all 
Dressed in a shroud. 
Forgive . . . if just for a little . . . 
I laugh aloud!




On the T. T. C. 


Assorted people sit or ride
Forced intimates: and "hide to hide" 
As close as in a double bed
They touch at thigh and arm and head 
And then get off . . . and go away 
To ride again . . . some other day!




Ode


If this is spring
You can have the thing! 




Old Hand 


Love is a dream
And love is pain, 
Love is a song 
And love is a chain. 
But love is a thing 
We can't forego
Take my word for it 
I've tried . . .
I know!




Observation


A mermaid was a fabled sea creature
Cold-eyed
But beautiful of face. 
Enchanting . . . heartless. 
Half woman.
Half fish!
Do you know, 
I looked about me to-day 
And thought
Of how many women 
Are really
Mermaids!
Fall Fires
O scudding sky-O windy day
You snare my soul. 
And fey . . . as fey 
I wander down a curving street
To scuff the leaves against my feet 
And smell the smoke that curls the air 
And find the Autumn wondrous fair!




Now is the Time 


Now is the time when falling snow 
Drifts soft as flowerlets.
Far below 
The dark earth stretching in her sleep
Is full of secrets.
Children keep one little ear above each cover
Lest in the night they might discover 
The sound of hoofbeats in the air 
And know that Santa Claus is there!




Self-Portrait. (Drawn in Dust on a Table Top)


Tho' I'd love to be neat 
I admit defeat.
Some women's shoes are on racks
Mine are in stacks.

I can never find a needle or pin 
They're never in what I put them in. 
And when I emerge in confusion 
From this rudderless fog
I closely resemble a something 
You'd find under a log!




Be Good!


"Be good, my child" the sages said 
And packed me off to early bed.
I didn't mind when I was small 
And never loitered in the hall
But climbed the stair and clicked the light 
And closed my eyes against the night. 
But now . . . upon the sill I lean
And feel the wind across my throat 
And tremble when the moon is new 
And watch the stars the whole night through
For love has set his sign on me . . . 
And I am neither young . . . nor free! 




Camouflage


I said:
"I will sing you a song in the night
How your eves wear desire and your voice holds delight
But I'll sing it so softly you'll never believe 
That this thing is my heart that I wear on my sleeve.




Observation


To find an oyster in a seafood salad
Is quite a surprise to the average "palad". 




Sixteen


How can a guy absorb this knowledge 
And get himself ready for ruddy college; 
How can he concentrate at all
When he just passed a dream in the upper hall!




Hush 


There is an hour
When earth and sky 
Merge in the twilight 
With a sort of sigh. 
Trees touch the skyline . . . 
Birds, the earth,
And stars are shaken 
With twinkling mirth. 
And it's just as well 
If you're all alone 
To plug the line
Of your telephone! 




First Snow 


Just a thin flurry
But the first snow! 
Always exciting . . . 
Full of pictures . . . 
Overstockings of red wool, 
Mittens to match,
And a toboggan cap 
With a bob on it. 
Bruised thumbs
From struggling with tight overshoes -
A plaid kilt
With a green velveteen jacket 
And a real lace collar.
A teacher's face, 
Slightly harried 
Bending over solicitous buttons.
The beautiful breathlessness	
Of the first belly flop
On the small red sleigh. 
Just a thin flurry
But the first snow!




Mirror 


I looked in a mirror
And all I saw
Was the pitiless scar 
Of Time's sharp claw. 
But over a candle
I looked in your eyes 
And there, reflected 
To my surprise

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
This particular work is one of the few copyrighted individual works
included with the permission of the copyright holder.  Information on
the copyright owner for this particular work and the terms of use
imposed by the copyright holder on this work are set forth at the
beginning of this work.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
