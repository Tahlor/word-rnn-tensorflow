Bye-a Baby
Bunting
White, Fast Black, and all the New Colors,
Garments sewed with our FAST BLACK
will never show white on the seams
after being worn or washed.
Bye a baby bunting,
Daddy's gone a hunting.
For to buy a rabbit skin
To wrap up baby bunting in.
But mamma stays at home, you see
To play with baby and O. N. T.
Hickery, dickery, 6 and 7,
Hollowbone, crackabone, 10 and 11;
Spinnery, spannery, musketry,
Twiddle 'um, twaddle 'um, O. N. T.
Multiplication is vexation,
Division is as bad,
The Rule of Three doth puzzle me,
And Fractions make me mad:
But one of the pleasant things to me,
Is to handle a needle with O. N. T.
Pussy-cat, pussy-cat,
Where have you been?
I've been to London
To look at the queen.
Pussy-cat, pussy-cat,
What did you see?
I saw the queen
Sewing with O. N. T.
Brow brinky, eye winky,
Chin choppy, nose noppy,
Cheek cherry, mouth merry,
Baby's face, as bright can be,
As she plays with O. N. T.
Betty Pringle had a little pig,
Not very little and not very big;
When alive he lived in clover,
But now he's dead, he's dead all over.
So Billy Pringle he lay down and cried,
And Betty Pringle she lay down and died;
So there was an end of one, two and three,
Billy Pringle he,
Betty Pringle she,
And Piggie Wiggee,
All of which rhymes with our O. N. T.
Hip-i-ty hop
To the barber shop,
This horse of mine,
He will not stop.
I'll buy a spool of cotton,
One for you,
And one for me,
Which shall it be?
Why, O. N. T.
Great A, little a.
Bouncing B!
The cat's in the cupboard,
And she can't see
That her kittens are playing with O. N. T.
