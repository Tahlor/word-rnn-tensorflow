TO THE MOST WORTHILY HONOURED, MY SINGULAR
GOOD LORD, ROBERT, EARL OF SOMERSET, LORD
CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.

I have adventured, right noble Earl, out of my utmost and
ever-vowed service to your virtues, to entitle their merits to the
patronage of Homer‚Äôs English life, whose wished natural life the
great Macedon would have protected as the spirit of his empire,

     That he to his unmeasur‚Äôd mighty acts
  Might add a fame as vast; and their extracts,
  In fires as bright and endless as the stars,
  His breast might breathe and thunder out his wars.
  But that great monarch‚Äôs love of fame and praise
  Receives an envious cloud in our foul days;
  For since our great ones ceased themselves to do,
  Deeds worth their praise, they hold it folly too
  To feed their praise in others.  But what can,
  Of all the gifts that are, be giv‚Äôn to man
  More precious than Eternity and Glory,
  Singing their praises in unsilenc‚Äôd story?
  Which no black day, no nation, nor no age,
  No change of time or fortune, force nor rage,
  Shall ever rase?  All which the monarch knew,
  Where Homer liv‚Äôd entitled, would ensue:
  _Cujus de gurgite vivo
  Combibit arcanos vatum omnis turba furores, etc._
  From whose deep fount of life the thirsty rout
  Of Thespian prophets have lien sucking out
  Their sacred rages.  And as th‚Äô influent stone
  Of Father Jove‚Äôs great and laborious son
  Lifts high the heavy iron, and far implies
  The wide orbs that the needle rectifies,
  In virtuous guide of ev‚Äôry sea-driv‚Äôn course,
  To all aspiring his one boundless force;
  So from one Homer all the holy fire
  That ever did the hidden heat inspire
  In each true Muse came clearly sparkling down,
  And must for him compose one flaming crown.
     He, at Jove‚Äôs table set, fills out to us
  Cups that repair age sad and ruinous,
  And gives it built of an eternal stand
  With his all-sinewy Odyss√¶an hand,
  Shifts time and fate, puts death in life‚Äôs free state,
  And life doth into ages propagate.
  He doth in men the Gods‚Äô affects inflame,
  His fuel Virtue blown by Praise and Fame;
  And, with the high soul‚Äôs first impression driv‚Äôn,
  Breaks through rude chaos, earth, the seas, and heav‚Äôn.
  The nerves of all things hid in nature lie
  Naked before him; all their harmony
  Tun‚Äôd to his accents, that in beasts breathe minds.
  What fowls, what floods, what earth, what air, what winds,
  What fires ethereal, what the Gods conclude
  In all their counsels, his Muse makes indued
  With varied voices that ev‚Äôn rocks have mov‚Äôd.
  And yet for all this, naked Virtue lov‚Äôd,
  Honours without her he as abject prizes,
  And foolish Fame, deriv‚Äôd from thence, despises.
  When from the vulgar taking glorious bound
  Up to the mountain where the Muse is crown‚Äôd,
  He sits and laughs to see the jaded rabble
  Toil to his hard heights, t‚Äô all access unable, etc.

And that your Lordship may in his face take view of his mind, the
first words of his Iliads is _ŒºŒ∑ÃëŒΩŒπŒΩ, wrath_; the first word of his
Odysseys, _·ºÑŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ± man:_ contracting in either word his each
work‚Äôs proposition.  In one _predominant perturbation;_ in the
other _over-ruling wisdom._  In one the body‚Äôs fervour and fashion
of outward fortitude to all possible height of heroical action; in the
other the mind‚Äôs inward, constant, and unconquered empire,
unbroken, unaltered, with any most insolent, and tyrannous
infliction.  To many most sovereign praises is this poem entitled;
but to that grace, in chief, which sets on the crown both of poets
and orators; _œÑŒøÃÄ‚Ä≠ œÑŒ±ÃÄ ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅŒ±ÃÄ ŒºŒµŒ≥·Ω±ŒªœâœÇ, Œ∫Œ±ŒπÃÄ œÑŒ±ÃÄ Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩŒ±ÃÄ Œ∫Œ±Œπ·Ω∑ŒΩœâœÇ:_ that is,
‚Ä≠_Parva magn√® dicere; pervulgata nov√®; jejuna plen√®.--To speak
‚Ä≠things little greatly; things common rarely; things barren and empty
‚Ä≠fruitfully and fully._  The return of a man into his country is his
‚Ä≠whole scope and object; which in itself, your Lordship may well
‚Ä≠say, is jejune and fruitless enough, affording nothing feastful,
‚Ä≠nothing magnificent.  And yet even this doth the divine inspiration
‚Ä≠render vast, illustrious, and of miraculous composure.  And for
‚Ä≠this, my Lord, is this poem preferred to his lliads; for therein much
‚Ä≠magnificence, both of person and action, gives great aid to his
‚Ä≠industry; but in this are these helps exceeding sparing, or nothing;
‚Ä≠and yet is the structure so elaborate and pompous that the poor
‚Ä≠plain ground-work, considered together, may seem the naturally
‚Ä≠rich womb to it, and produce it needfully.  Much wondered at,
‚Ä≠therefore, is the censure of Dionysius Longinus, (a man otherwise
‚Ä≠affirmed grave and of elegant judgment,) comparing Homer in his
‚Ä≠Iliads to the Sun rising, in his Odysseys to his descent or setting,
‚Ä≠or to the ocean robbed of his √¶sture, many tributary floods and
‚Ä≠rivers of excellent ornament withheld from their observance. When
‚Ä≠this his work so far exceeds the ocean, with all his court and
‚Ä≠concourse, that all his sea is only a serviceable stream to it.
‚Ä≠Nor can it be compared to any one power to be named in nature,
‚Ä≠being an entirely well-sorted and digested confluence of all;
‚Ä≠where the most solid and grave is made as nimble and fluent as the
‚Ä≠most airy and fiery, the nimble and fluent as firm and
‚Ä≠well-bounded as the most grave and solid.  And, taking all
‚Ä≠together, of so tender impression, and of such command to the
‚Ä≠voice of the Muse, that they knock heaven with her breath, and
‚Ä≠discover their foundations as low as hell.  Nor is this
‚Ä≠all-comprising Poesy fantastic or mere fictive; but the most
‚Ä≠material and doctrinal illations of truth, both for all manly
‚Ä≠information of manners in the young, all prescription of justice,
‚Ä≠and even Christian piety, in the most grave and high governed.  To
‚Ä≠illustrate both which, in both kinds, with all heightof expression,
‚Ä≠the Poet creates both a body and a soul in them.  Wherein, if the
‚Ä≠body (being the letter or history) seems fictive, and beyond
‚Ä≠possibility to bring into act, the sense then and allegory, which
‚Ä≠is the soul, is to be sought, which intends a more eminent
‚Ä≠expressure of Virtue for her loveliness, and of Vice for her
‚Ä≠ugliness, in their several effects; going beyond the life than any art
‚Ä≠within life can possibly delineate.  Why then is fiction to this end
‚Ä≠so hateful to our true ignorants?  Or why should a poor chronicler
‚Ä≠of a Lord Mayor‚Äôs naked truth (that peradventure will last his year)
‚Ä≠include more worth with our modern wizards than Homer for his
‚Ä≠naked Ulysses clad in eternal fiction?  But this proser Dionysius,
‚Ä≠and the rest of these grave and reputatively learned--that dare
‚Ä≠undertake for their gravities the headstrong censure of all things,
‚Ä≠and challenge the understanding of these toys in their childhoods;
‚Ä≠when even these childish vanities retain deep and most necessary
‚Ä≠learning enough in them to make them children in their ages,
‚Ä≠and teach them while they live--are not in these absolute divine
‚Ä≠infusions allowed either voice or relish: for, _Qui Poeticas ad fores
‚Ä≠accedit, etc._  (says the divine philosopher) he that knocks at the
‚Ä≠gates of the Muses, _sine Musarum furore,_ is neither to be
‚Ä≠admitted entry, nor a touch at their thresholds; his opinion of entry
‚Ä≠ridiculous, and his presumption impious.  Nor must Poets
‚Ä≠themselves (might I a little insist on these contempts, not tempting
‚Ä≠too far your Lordship‚Äôs Ulyssean patience) presume to these doors
‚Ä≠without the truly genuine and peculiar induction.  There being in
‚Ä≠Poesy a twofold rapture,--or alienation of soul, as the abovesaid
‚Ä≠teacher terms it,--one _insania,_ a disease of the mind, and a mere
‚Ä≠madness, by which the infected is thrust beneath all the degrees of
‚Ä≠humanity: _et ex homine, brutum quodammod√≤ redditur:_--(for
‚Ä≠which poor Poesy, in this diseased and impostorous age, is so
‚Ä≠barbarously vilified;)--the other is, _divinus furor,_ by which the
‚Ä≠sound and divinely healthful _supr√† hominis naturam erigitur, et in
‚Ä≠Deum transit._  One a perfection directly infused from God;
‚Ä≠the other an infection obliquely and degenerately proceeding
‚Ä≠from man.  Of the divine fury, my Lord, your Homer hath ever
‚Ä≠been both first and last instance; being pronounced absolutely,
‚Ä≠_œÑŒøÃÄŒΩ œÉŒøœÜ·ΩΩœÑŒ±œÑŒøŒΩ, Œ∫Œ±ŒπÃÄ œÑŒøÃÄŒΩ Œ∏ŒµŒπ·ΩπœÑŒ±œÑŒøŒΩ œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÑ·ΩµŒΩ,_  ‚ÄúTHE MOST WISE
‚Ä≠AND MOST DIVINE POET.‚Äù Against whom whosoever shall
‚Ä≠open his profane mouth may worthily receive answer with
‚Ä≠this of his divine defender--Empedocles, Heraclitus, Protagoras,
‚Ä≠Epicharmus, etc., being of Homer‚Äôs part--_œÑ·Ω∑œÇ ŒøŒøÕíŒΩ,_ etc.; who
‚Ä≠against such an army, and the general Homer, dares attempt the
‚Ä≠assault, but he must be reputed ridiculous?  And yet against this
‚Ä≠host, and this invincible commander, shall we have every
‚Ä≠_besogne_ and fool a leader.  The common herd, I assure myself,
‚Ä≠ready to receive it on their horns.  Their infected leaders,

‚Ä≠     Such men as sideling ride the ambling Muse,
‚Ä≠  Whose saddle is as frequent as the stews.
‚Ä≠  Whose raptures are in ev‚Äôry pageant seen,
‚Ä≠  In ev‚Äôry wassail-rhyme and dancing-green;
‚Ä≠  When he that writes by any beam of truth
‚Ä≠  Must dive as deep as he, past shallow youth.
‚Ä≠  Truth dwells in gulfs, whose deeps hide shades so rich
‚Ä≠  That Night sits muffled there in clouds of pitch,
‚Ä≠  More dark than Nature made her, and requires,
‚Ä≠  To clear her tough mists, heav‚Äôn‚Äôs great fire of fires,
‚Ä≠  To whom the sun itself is but a beam.
‚Ä≠  For sick souls then--but rapt in foolish dream--
‚Ä≠  To wrastle with these heav‚Äôn-strong mysteries,
‚Ä≠  What madness is it?  when their light serves eyes
‚Ä≠  That are not worldly in their least aspect,
‚Ä≠  But truly pure, and aim at heav‚Äôn direct.
‚Ä≠  Yet these none like but what the brazen head
‚Ä≠  Blatters abroad, no sooner born but dead.

‚Ä≠Holding, then, in eternal contempt, my Lord, those short-lived
‚Ä≠bubbles, eternize your virtue and judgment with the Grecian
‚Ä≠monarch; esteeming, not as the least of your new-year‚Äôs presents,

‚Ä≠     Homer, three thousand years dead, now reviv‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn from that dull death that in life he liv‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  When none conceited him, none understood
‚Ä≠  That so much life in so much death as blood
‚Ä≠  Conveys about it could mix.  But when death
‚Ä≠  Drunk up the bloody mist that human breath
‚Ä≠  Pour‚Äôd round about him--poverty and spite.
‚Ä≠  Thick‚Äôning the hapless vapour--then truth‚Äôs light
‚Ä≠  Glimmer‚Äôd about his poem; the pinch‚Äôd soul
‚Ä≠  (Amidst the mysteries it did enrol)
‚Ä≠  Brake pow‚Äôrfully abroad.  And as we see
‚Ä≠  The sun all-hid in clouds, at length got free,
‚Ä≠  Through some forc‚Äôd covert, over all the ways,
‚Ä≠  Near and beneath him, shoots his vented rays
‚Ä≠  Far off, and sticks them in some little glade,
‚Ä≠  All woods, fields, rivers, left besides in shade;
‚Ä≠  So your Apollo, from that world of light
‚Ä≠  Clos‚Äôd in his poem‚Äôs body, shot to sight
‚Ä≠  Some few forc‚Äôd beams, which near him were not seen,
‚Ä≠  (As in his life or country) Fate and spleen
‚Ä≠  Clouding their radiance; which when Death had clear‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  To far-off regions his free beams appear‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  In which all stood and wonder‚Äôd, striving which
‚Ä≠  His birth and rapture should in right enrich.
‚Ä≠     Twelve labours of your Thespian Hercules
‚Ä≠  I now present your Lordship; do but please
‚Ä≠  To lend life means till th‚Äô other twelve receive
‚Ä≠  Equal achievement; and let Death then reave
‚Ä≠  My life now lost in our patrician loves,
‚Ä≠  That knock heads with the herd; in whom there moves
‚Ä≠  One blood, one soul, both drown‚Äôd in one set height
‚Ä≠  Of stupid envy and mere popular spite.
‚Ä≠  Whose loves with no good did my least vein fill;
‚Ä≠  And from their hates I fear as little ill.
‚Ä≠  Their bounties nourish not when most they feed,
‚Ä≠  But, where there is no merit or no need,
‚Ä≠  Rain into rivers still, and are such show‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  As bubbles spring and overflow the flow‚Äôrs.
‚Ä≠  Their worse parts and worst men their best suborns,
‚Ä≠  Like winter cows whose milk runs to their horns.
‚Ä≠  And as litigious clients‚Äô books of law
‚Ä≠  Cost infinitely; taste of all the awe
‚Ä≠  Bench‚Äôd in our kingdom‚Äôs policy, piety, state;
‚Ä≠  Earn all their deep explorings; satiate
‚Ä≠  All sorts there thrust together by the heart
‚Ä≠  With thirst of wisdom spent on either part;
‚Ä≠  Horrid examples made of Life and Death
‚Ä≠  From their fine stuff wov‚Äôn; yet when once the breath
‚Ä≠  Of sentence leaves them, all their worth is drawn
‚Ä≠  As dry as dust, and wears like cobweb lawn:
‚Ä≠  So these men set a price upon their worth,
‚Ä≠  That no man gives but those that trot it forth
‚Ä≠  Though Need‚Äôs foul ways, feed Humours with all cost
‚Ä≠  Though Judgment sterves in them; rout, State engrost
‚Ä≠  (At all tobacco-benches, solemn tables,
‚Ä≠  Where all that cross their envies are their fables)
‚Ä≠  In their rank faction; shame and death approv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Fit penance for their opposites; none lov‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  But those that rub them; not a reason heard
‚Ä≠  That doth not soothe and glorify their preferr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Bitter opinions.  When, would Truth resume
‚Ä≠  The cause to his hands, all would fly in fume
‚Ä≠  Before his sentence; since the innocent mind
‚Ä≠  Just God makes good, to Whom their worst is wind.
‚Ä≠  For, that I freely all my thoughts express,
‚Ä≠  My conscience is my thousand witnesses;
‚Ä≠  And to this stay my constant comforts vow,
‚Ä≠  _You for the world I have, or God for you._

‚Ä≠  THE FIRST BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  The Gods in council sit, to call
‚Ä≠  Ulysses from Calypso‚Äôs thrall,
‚Ä≠  And order their high pleasures thus:
‚Ä≠  Grey Pallas to Telemachus
‚Ä≠  (In Ithaca) her way addrest;
‚Ä≠  And did her heav‚Äônly limbs invest
‚Ä≠  In Mentas‚Äô likeness, that did reign
‚Ä≠  King of the Taphians, in the main
‚Ä≠  Whose rough waves near Leucadia run.
‚Ä≠  Advising wise Ulysses‚Äô son
‚Ä≠  To seek his father, and address
‚Ä≠  His course to young Tantalides,
‚Ä≠  That govern‚Äôd Sparta.  Thus much said,
‚Ä≠  She shew‚Äôd she was Heav‚Äôn‚Äôs martial Maid,
‚Ä≠  And vanish‚Äôd from him.  Next to this,
‚Ä≠  The Banquet of the Wooers is.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _·ºäŒªœÜŒ±._
‚Ä≠     The Deities sit;
‚Ä≠        The Man retired;
‚Ä≠     Th‚Äô Ulyssean wit
‚Ä≠        By Pallas fired.

‚Ä≠  The man, O Muse, inform, that many a way  [1]
‚Ä≠  Wound with his wisdom to his wished stay;
‚Ä≠  That wander‚Äôd wondrous far, when he the town
‚Ä≠  Of sacred Troy had sack‚Äôd and shiver‚Äôd down;
‚Ä≠  The cities of a world of nations,
‚Ä≠  With all their manners, minds, and fashions,
‚Ä≠  He saw and knew; at sea felt many woes,
‚Ä≠  Much care sustain‚Äôd, to save from overthrows
‚Ä≠  Himself and friends in their retreat for home;
‚Ä≠  But so their fates he could not overcome,
‚Ä≠  Though much he thirsted it.  O men unwise,
‚Ä≠  They perish‚Äôd by their own impieties!
‚Ä≠  That in their hunger‚Äôs rapine would not shun
‚Ä≠  The oxen of the lofty-going Sun,
‚Ä≠  Who therefore from their eyes the day bereft
‚Ä≠  Of safe return.  These acts, in some part left,
‚Ä≠  Tell us, as others, deified Seed of Jove.
‚Ä≠     Now all the rest that austere death outstrove
‚Ä≠  At Troy‚Äôs long siege at home safe anchor‚Äôd are,
‚Ä≠  Free from the malice both of sea and war;
‚Ä≠  Only Ulysses is denied access
‚Ä≠  To wife and home.  The grace of Goddesses,
‚Ä≠  The rev‚Äôrend nymph Calypso, did detain
‚Ä≠  Him in her caves, past all the race of men
‚Ä≠  Enflam‚Äôd to make him her lov‚Äôd lord and spouse.
‚Ä≠  And when the Gods had destin‚Äôd that his house,
‚Ä≠  Which Ithaca on her rough bosom bears,
‚Ä≠  (The point of time wrought out by ambient years)
‚Ä≠  Should be his haven, Contention still extends
‚Ä≠  Her envy to him, ev‚Äôn amongst his friends.
‚Ä≠  All Gods took pity on him; only he,
‚Ä≠  That girds earth in the cincture of the sea,
‚Ä≠  Divine Ulysses ever did envy,
‚Ä≠  And made the fix‚Äôd port of his birth to fly.
‚Ä≠     But he himself solemniz‚Äôd a retreat
‚Ä≠  To th‚Äô √Üthiops, far dissunder‚Äôd in their seat,
‚Ä≠  (In two parts parted, at the sun‚Äôs descent,
‚Ä≠  And underneath his golden orient,
‚Ä≠  The first and last of men) t‚Äô enjoy their feast
‚Ä≠  Of bulls and lambs, in hecatombs addrest;  [2]
‚Ä≠  At which he sat, giv‚Äôn over to delight.
‚Ä≠     The other Gods in heav‚Äôn‚Äôs supremest height
‚Ä≠  Were all in council met; to whom began
‚Ä≠  The mighty Father both of God and man
‚Ä≠  Discourse, inducing matter that inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To wise Ulysses, calling to his mind
‚Ä≠  Faultful √Ügisthus, who to death was done  [3]
‚Ä≠  By young Orestes, Agamemnon‚Äôs son.
‚Ä≠  His memory to the Immortals then
‚Ä≠  Mov‚Äôd Jove thus deeply:  ‚ÄúO how falsely men
‚Ä≠  Accuse us Gods as authors of their ill!
‚Ä≠  When, by the bane their own bad lives instill,
‚Ä≠  They suffer all the mis‚Äôries of their states,
‚Ä≠  Past our inflictions, and beyond their fates.
‚Ä≠  As now √Ügisthus, past his fate, did wed
‚Ä≠  The wife of Agamemnon, and (in dread
‚Ä≠  To suffer death himself) to shun his ill,
‚Ä≠  Incurr‚Äôd it by the loose bent of his will,
‚Ä≠  In slaughtering Atrides in retreat.
‚Ä≠  Which we foretold him would so hardly set
‚Ä≠  To his murd‚Äôrous purpose, sending Mercury
‚Ä≠  That slaughter‚Äôd Argus, our consid‚Äôrate spy,
‚Ä≠  To give him this charge: ‚ÄòDo not wed his wife,
‚Ä≠  Nor murder him; for thou shalt buy his life
‚Ä≠  With ransom of thine own, impos‚Äôd on thee
‚Ä≠  By his Orestes, when in him shall be
‚Ä≠  Atrides‚Äô-self renew‚Äôd, and but the prime
‚Ä≠  Of youth‚Äôs spring put abroad, in thirst to climb
‚Ä≠  His haughty father‚Äôs throne by his high acts.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  These words of Hermes wrought not into facts
‚Ä≠  √Ügisthus‚Äô powers; good counsel he despis‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And to that good his ill is sacrific‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Pallas, whose eyes did sparkle like the skies,
‚Ä≠  Answer‚Äôd: ‚ÄúO Sire! Supreme of Deities,
‚Ä≠  √Ügisthus pass‚Äôd his fate, and had desert
‚Ä≠  To warrant our infliction; and convert
‚Ä≠  May all the pains such impious men inflict
‚Ä≠  On innocent suff‚Äôrers to revenge as strict,
‚Ä≠  Their own hearts eating.  But, that Ithacus,
‚Ä≠  Thus never meriting, should suffer thus,
‚Ä≠  I deeply suffer.  His more pious mind
‚Ä≠  Divides him from these fortunes.  Though unkind
‚Ä≠  Is piety to him, giving him a fate
‚Ä≠  More suff‚Äôring than the most unfortunate,
‚Ä≠  So long kept friendless in a sea-girt soil,
‚Ä≠  Where the sea‚Äôs navel is a sylvan isle,
‚Ä≠  In which the Goddess dwells that doth derive
‚Ä≠  Her birth from Atlas, who of all alive
‚Ä≠  The motion and the fashion doth command
‚Ä≠  With his wise mind, whose forces understand  [4]
‚Ä≠  The inmost deeps and gulfs of all the seas,
‚Ä≠  Who (for his skill of things superior) stays
‚Ä≠  The two steep columns that prop earth and heav‚Äôn.
‚Ä≠  His daughter ‚Äòtis, who holds this homeless-driv‚Äôn  [5]
‚Ä≠  Still mourning with her; evermore profuse
‚Ä≠  Of soft and winning speeches, that abuse
‚Ä≠  And make so languishingly, and possest  [6]
‚Ä≠  With so remiss a mind her loved guest,
‚Ä≠  Manage the action of his way for home.
‚Ä≠  Where he, though in affection overcome,
‚Ä≠  In judgment yet more longs to show his hopes
‚Ä≠  His country‚Äôs smoke leap from her chimney tops,
‚Ä≠  And death asks in her arms.  Yet never shall
‚Ä≠  Thy lov‚Äôd heart be converted on his thrall,
‚Ä≠  Austere Olympius.  Did not ever he,
‚Ä≠  In ample Troy, thy altars gratify,
‚Ä≠  And Grecians‚Äô fleet make in thy off‚Äôrings swim?
‚Ä≠  Jove, why still then burns thy wrath to him?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The Cloud-assembler answer‚Äôd: ‚ÄúWhat words fly,
‚Ä≠  Bold daughter, from thy pale of ivory?  [7]
‚Ä≠  As if I ever could cast from my care
‚Ä≠  Divine Ulysses, who exceeds so far
‚Ä≠  All men in wisdom, and so oft hath giv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  To all th‚Äô Immortals thron‚Äôd in ample heav‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  So great and sacred gifts?  But his decrees,
‚Ä≠  That holds the earth in with his nimble knees,
‚Ä≠  Stand to Ulysses‚Äô longings so extreme,
‚Ä≠  For taking from the God-foe Polypheme
‚Ä≠  His only eye; a Cyclop, that excell‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  All other Cyclops, with whose burden swell‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The nymph Thoosa, the divine increase
‚Ä≠  Of Phorcys‚Äô seed, a great God of the seas.
‚Ä≠  She mix‚Äôd with Neptune in his hollow caves,
‚Ä≠  And bore this Cyclop to that God of waves.
‚Ä≠  For whose lost eye, th‚Äô Earth-shaker did not kill
‚Ä≠  Erring Ulysses, but reserves him still
‚Ä≠  In life for more death.  But use we our pow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  And round about us cast these cares of ours,
‚Ä≠  All to discover how we may prefer
‚Ä≠  His wish‚Äôd retreat, and Neptune make forbear
‚Ä≠  His stern eye to him, since no one God can,
‚Ä≠  In spite of all, prevail, but ‚Äôgainst a man.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     To this, this answer made the grey-eyed Maid:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúSupreme of rulers, since so well apaid
‚Ä≠  The bless√©d Gods are all then, now, in thee,
‚Ä≠  To limit wise Ulysses‚Äô misery,
‚Ä≠  And that you speak as you referr‚Äôd to me
‚Ä≠  Prescription for the means, in this sort be
‚Ä≠  Their sacred order: Let us now address
‚Ä≠  With utmost speed our swift Argicides,
‚Ä≠  To tell the nymph that bears the golden tress
‚Ä≠  In th‚Äô isle Ogygia, that ‚Äôtis our will
‚Ä≠  She should not stay our lov‚Äôd Ulysses still,
‚Ä≠  But suffer his return; and then will I
‚Ä≠  To Ithaca, to make his son apply
‚Ä≠  His sire‚Äôs inquest the more; infusing force
‚Ä≠  Into his soul, to summon the concourse
‚Ä≠  Of curl‚Äôd-head Greeks to council, and deter
‚Ä≠  Each wooer, that hath been the slaughterer
‚Ä≠  Of his fat sheep and crooked-headed beeves.
‚Ä≠  From more wrong to his mother, and their leaves
‚Ä≠  Take in such terms as fit deserts so great.
‚Ä≠  To Sparta then, and Pylos, where doth beat
‚Ä≠  Bright Amathus, the flood, and epithet
‚Ä≠  To all that kingdom, my advice shall send
‚Ä≠  The spirit-advanc‚Äôd Prince, to the pious end
‚Ä≠  Of seeking his lost father, if he may
‚Ä≠  Receive report from Fame where rests his stay;
‚Ä≠  And make, besides, his own successive worth
‚Ä≠  Known to the world, and set in action forth.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, her wing‚Äôd shoes to her feet she tied,
‚Ä≠  Form‚Äôd all of gold, and all eternified,
‚Ä≠  That on the round earth or the sea sustain‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Her ravish‚Äôd substance swift as gusts of wind.
‚Ä≠  Then took she her strong lance with steel made keen,
‚Ä≠  Great, massy, active, that whole hosts of men,
‚Ä≠  Though all hero√´s, conquers, if her ire
‚Ä≠  Their wrongs inflame, back‚Äôd by so great a Sire.
‚Ä≠  Down from Olympus‚Äô tops she headlong div‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And swift as thought in Ithaca arriv‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Close at Ulysses‚Äô gates; in whose first court
‚Ä≠  She made her stand, and, for her breast‚Äôs support,
‚Ä≠  Lean‚Äôd on her iron lance; her form imprest
‚Ä≠  With Mentas‚Äô likeness, come as being a guest.
‚Ä≠  There found she those proud wooers, that were then
‚Ä≠  Set on those ox-hides that themselves had slain,
‚Ä≠  Before the gates, and all at dice were playing.
‚Ä≠  To them the heralds, and the rest obeying,
‚Ä≠  Fill‚Äôd wine and water; some, still as they play‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And some, for solemn supper‚Äôs state, purvey‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  With porous sponges cleansing tables, serv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With much rich feast; of which to all they kerv‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     God-like Telemachus amongst them sat,
‚Ä≠  Griev‚Äôd much in mind; and in his heart begat
‚Ä≠  All representment of his absent sire,
‚Ä≠  How, come from far-off parts, his spirits would fire
‚Ä≠  With those proud wooers‚Äô sight, with slaughter parting
‚Ä≠  Their bold concourse, and to himself converting
‚Ä≠  The honours they usurp‚Äôd, his own commanding.
‚Ä≠     In this discourse, he first saw Pallas standing,
‚Ä≠  Unbidden entry; up rose, and addrest
‚Ä≠  His pace right to her, angry that a guest
‚Ä≠  Should stand so long at gate; and, coming near,
‚Ä≠  Her right hand took, took in his own her spear,
‚Ä≠  And thus saluted:  ‚ÄúGrace to your repair,
‚Ä≠  Fair guest, your welcome shall be likewise fair.
‚Ä≠  Enter, and, cheer‚Äôd with feast, disclose th‚Äô intent
‚Ä≠  That caus‚Äôd your coming.‚Äù  This said, first he went,
‚Ä≠  And Pallas follow‚Äôd.  To a room they came,
‚Ä≠  Steep, and of state; the jav‚Äôlin of the Dame
‚Ä≠  He set against a pillar vast and high,
‚Ä≠  Amidst a large and bright-kept armory,
‚Ä≠  Which was, besides, with woods of lances grac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of his grave father‚Äôs.  In a throne he plac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The man-turn‚Äôd Goddess, under which was spread
‚Ä≠  A carpet, rich and of deviceful thread;
‚Ä≠  A footstool staying her feet; and by her chair
‚Ä≠  Another seat (all garnish‚Äôd wondrous fair,
‚Ä≠  To rest or sleep on in the day) he set,
‚Ä≠  Far from the prease of wooers, lest at meat
‚Ä≠  The noise they still made might offend his guest,
‚Ä≠  Disturbing him at banquet or at rest,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn to his combat with that pride of theirs,
‚Ä≠  That kept no noble form in their affairs.
‚Ä≠  And these he set far from them, much the rather
‚Ä≠  To question freely of his absent father.
‚Ä≠     A table fairly-polish‚Äôd then was spread,
‚Ä≠  On which a rev‚Äôrend officer set bread,
‚Ä≠  And other servitors all sorts of meat
‚Ä≠  (Salads, and flesh, such as their haste could get)
‚Ä≠  Serv‚Äôd with observance in.  And then the sewer
‚Ä≠  Pour‚Äôd water from a great and golden ewer,
‚Ä≠  That from their hands t‚Äô a silver caldron ran.
‚Ä≠  Both wash‚Äôd, and seated close, the voiceful man
‚Ä≠  Fetch‚Äôd cups of gold, and set by them, and round
‚Ä≠  Those cups with wine with all endeavour crown‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     Then rush‚Äôd in the rude wooers, themselves plac‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  The heralds water gave; the maids in haste
‚Ä≠  Serv‚Äôd bread from baskets.  When, of all prepar‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  And set before them, the bold wooers shar‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Their pages plying their cups past the rest.
‚Ä≠  But lusty wooers must do more than feast;
‚Ä≠  For now, their hungers and their thirsts allay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  They call‚Äôd for songs and dances; those, they said,
‚Ä≠  Were th‚Äô ornaments of feast.  The herald straight
‚Ä≠  A harp, carv‚Äôd full of artificial sleight,
‚Ä≠  Thrust into Phemius‚Äô, a learn‚Äôd singer‚Äôs, hand,
‚Ä≠  Who, till he much was urg‚Äôd, on terms did stand,
‚Ä≠  But, after, play‚Äôd and sung with all his art.
‚Ä≠     Telemachus to Pallas then (apart,
‚Ä≠  His ear inclining close, that none might hear)
‚Ä≠  In this sort said:  ‚ÄúMy guest, exceeding dear,
‚Ä≠  Will you not sit incens‚Äôd with what I say?
‚Ä≠  These are the cares these men take; feast and play.
‚Ä≠  Which eas‚Äôly they may use, because they eat,
‚Ä≠  Free and unpunish‚Äôd, of another‚Äôs meat;
‚Ä≠  And of a man‚Äôs, whose white bones wasting lie
‚Ä≠  In some far region; with th‚Äô incessancy
‚Ä≠  Of show‚Äôrs pour‚Äôd down upon them, lying ashore,
‚Ä≠  Or in the seas wash‚Äôd nak‚Äôd.  Who, if he wore
‚Ä≠  Those bones with flesh and life and industry,
‚Ä≠  And these might here in Ithaca set eye
‚Ä≠  On him return‚Äôd, they all would wish to be
‚Ä≠  Either past other in celerity
‚Ä≠  Of feet and knees, and not contend t‚Äô exceed
‚Ä≠  In golden garments.  But his virtues feed
‚Ä≠  The fate of ill death; nor is left to me
‚Ä≠  The least hope of his life‚Äôs recovery,
‚Ä≠  No, not if any of the mortal race
‚Ä≠  Should tell me his return; the cheerful face
‚Ä≠  Of his return‚Äôd day never will appear.
‚Ä≠  But tell me, and let Truth your witness bear,
‚Ä≠  Who, and from whence you are?  What city‚Äôs birth?
‚Ä≠  What parents?  In what vessel set you forth?
‚Ä≠  And with what mariners arriv‚Äôd you here?
‚Ä≠  I cannot think you a foot passenger.
‚Ä≠  Recount then to me all, to teach me well
‚Ä≠  Fit usage for your worth.  And if it fell
‚Ä≠  In chance now first that you thus see us here,
‚Ä≠  Or that in former passages you were
‚Ä≠  My father‚Äôs guest?  For many men have been
‚Ä≠  Guests to my father.  Studious of men
‚Ä≠  His sociable nature ever was.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  On him again the grey-eyed Maid did pass
‚Ä≠  This kind reply:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll answer passing true
‚Ä≠  All thou hast ask‚Äôd: My birth his honour drew
‚Ä≠  From wise Anchialus.  The name I bear
‚Ä≠  Is Mentas, the commanding islander
‚Ä≠  Of all the Taphians studious in the art
‚Ä≠  Of navigation; having touch‚Äôd this part
‚Ä≠  With ship and men, of purpose to maintain
‚Ä≠  Course through the dark seas t‚Äô other-languag‚Äôd men;
‚Ä≠  And Temesis sustains the city‚Äôs name
‚Ä≠  For which my ship is bound, made known by fame
‚Ä≠  For rich in brass, which my occasions need,
‚Ä≠  And therefore bring I shining steel in stead,
‚Ä≠  Which their use wants, yet makes my vessel‚Äôs freight,
‚Ä≠  That near a plough‚Äôd field rides at anchor‚Äôs weight,
‚Ä≠  Apart this city, in the harbour call‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Rhethrus, whose waves with Neius‚Äô woods are wall‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Thy sire and I were ever mutual guests,
‚Ä≠  At either‚Äôs house still interchanging feasts.
‚Ä≠  I glory in it.  Ask, when thou shalt see
‚Ä≠  Laertes, th‚Äô old hero√´, these of me,
‚Ä≠  From the beginning.   He, men say, no more
‚Ä≠  Visits the city, but will needs deplore
‚Ä≠  His son‚Äôs believ‚Äôd loss in a private field;
‚Ä≠  One old maid only at his hands to yield
‚Ä≠  Food to his life, as oft as labour makes
‚Ä≠  His old limbs faint; which, though he creeps, he takes
‚Ä≠  Along a fruitful plain, set all with vines,
‚Ä≠  Which husbandman-like, though a king, he proins.
‚Ä≠  But now I come to be thy father‚Äôs guest;
‚Ä≠  I hear he wanders, while these wooers feast.
‚Ä≠  And (as th‚Äô Immortals prompt me at this hour)
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll tell thee, out of a prophetic pow‚Äôr,
‚Ä≠  (Not as profess‚Äôd a prophet, nor clear seen
‚Ä≠  At all times what shall after chance to men)
‚Ä≠  What I conceive, for this time, will be true:
‚Ä≠  The Gods‚Äô inflictions keep your sire from you.
‚Ä≠  Divine Ulysses, yet, abides not dead
‚Ä≠  Above earth, nor beneath, nor buried
‚Ä≠  In any seas, as you did late conceive,
‚Ä≠  But, with the broad sea sieg‚Äôd, is kept alive
‚Ä≠  Within an isle by rude and upland men,
‚Ä≠  That in his spite his passage home detain.
‚Ä≠  Yet long it shall not be before he tread
‚Ä≠  His country‚Äôs dear earth, though solicited,
‚Ä≠  And held from his return, with iron chains;
‚Ä≠  For he hath wit to forge a world of trains,
‚Ä≠  And will, of all, be sure to make good one
‚Ä≠  For his return, so much relied upon.
‚Ä≠  But tell me, and be true: Art thou indeed
‚Ä≠  So much a son, as to be said the seed  [8]
‚Ä≠  Of Ithacus himself?  Exceeding much
‚Ä≠  Thy forehead and fair eyes at his form touch;
‚Ä≠  For oftentimes we met, as you and I
‚Ä≠  Meet at this hour, before he did apply
‚Ä≠  His pow‚Äôrs for Troy, when other Grecian states
‚Ä≠  In hollow ships were his associates.
‚Ä≠  But, since that time, mine eyes could never see
‚Ä≠  Renown‚Äôd Ulysses, nor met his with me.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The wise Telemachus again replied:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúYou shall with all I know be satisfied.
‚Ä≠  My mother certain says I am his son;
‚Ä≠  I know not; nor was ever simply known
‚Ä≠  By any child the sure truth of his sire.
‚Ä≠  But would my veins had took in living fire
‚Ä≠  From some man happy, rather than one wise,
‚Ä≠  Whom age might see seis‚Äôd of what youth made prise.
‚Ä≠  But he whoever of the mortal race
‚Ä≠  Is most unblest, he holds my father‚Äôs place.
‚Ä≠  This, since you ask, I answer.‚Äù She, again:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúThe Gods sure did not make the future strain
‚Ä≠  Both of thy race and days obscure to thee,
‚Ä≠  Since thou wert born so of Penelope.
‚Ä≠  The style may by thy after acts be won,
‚Ä≠  Of so great sire the high undoubted son.
‚Ä≠     Say truth in this then: What‚Äôs this feasting here?
‚Ä≠  What all this rout?  Is all this nuptial cheer?
‚Ä≠  Or else some friendly banquet made by thee?
‚Ä≠  For here no shots are, where all sharers be.
‚Ä≠  Past measure contumeliously this crew
‚Ä≠  Fare through thy house; which should th‚Äô ingenuous view
‚Ä≠  Of any good or wise man come and find,
‚Ä≠  (Impiety seeing play‚Äôd in ev‚Äôry kind)
‚Ä≠  He could not but through ev‚Äôry vein be mov‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Again Telemachus: ‚ÄúMy guest much lov‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Since you demand and sift these sights so far,
‚Ä≠  I grant ‚Äôtwere fit a house so regular,
‚Ä≠  Rich, and so faultless once in government,
‚Ä≠  Should still at all parts the same form present
‚Ä≠  That gave it glory while her lord was here.
‚Ä≠  But now the Gods, that us displeasure bear,
‚Ä≠  Have otherwise appointed, and disgrace
‚Ä≠  My father most of all the mortal race.
‚Ä≠  For whom I could not mourn so were he dead,
‚Ä≠  Amongst his fellow-captains slaughter√©d
‚Ä≠  By common enemies, or in the hands
‚Ä≠  Of his kind friends had ended his commands,
‚Ä≠  After he had egregiously bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His pow‚Äôr and order in a war so vow‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And to his tomb all Greeks their grace had done,
‚Ä≠  That to all ages he might leave his son
‚Ä≠  Immortal honour; but now Harpies have
‚Ä≠  Digg‚Äôd in their gorges his abhorr√©d grave.
‚Ä≠  Obscure, inglorious, death hath made his end,
‚Ä≠  And me, for glories, to all griefs contend.
‚Ä≠  Nor shall I any more mourn him alone,
‚Ä≠  The Gods have giv‚Äôn me other cause of moan.
‚Ä≠  For look how many optimates remain
‚Ä≠  In Samos, or the shores Dulichian,
‚Ä≠  Shady Zacynthus, or how many bear
‚Ä≠  Rule in the rough brows of this island here;
‚Ä≠  So many now my mother and this house
‚Ä≠  At all parts make defam‚Äôd and ruinous;
‚Ä≠  And she her hateful nuptials nor denies,
‚Ä≠  Nor will despatch their importunities,
‚Ä≠  Though she beholds them spoil still as they feast
‚Ä≠  All my free house yields, and the little rest
‚Ä≠  Of my dead sire in me perhaps intend
‚Ä≠  To bring ere long to some untimely end.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This Pallas sigh‚Äôd and answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúO,‚Äù  said she,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúAbsent Ulysses is much miss‚Äôd by thee,
‚Ä≠  That on these shameless suitors he might lay
‚Ä≠  His wreakful hands.  Should he now come, and stay
‚Ä≠  In thy court‚Äôs first gates, arm‚Äôd with helm and shield,
‚Ä≠  And two such darts as I have seen him wield,
‚Ä≠  When first I saw him in our Taphian court,
‚Ä≠  Feasting, and doing his desert‚Äôs disport;
‚Ä≠  When from Ephyrus he return‚Äôd by us
‚Ä≠  From Ilus, son to Centaur Mermerus,
‚Ä≠  To whom he travell‚Äôd through the wat‚Äôry dreads,
‚Ä≠  For bane to poison his sharp arrows‚Äô heads,
‚Ä≠  That death, but touch‚Äôd, caus‚Äôd; which he would not give,
‚Ä≠  Because he fear‚Äôd the Gods that ever live
‚Ä≠  Would plague such death with death; and yet their fear
‚Ä≠  Was to my father‚Äôs bosom not so dear
‚Ä≠  As was thy father‚Äôs love; (for what he sought
‚Ä≠  My loving father found him to a thought.)
‚Ä≠  If such as then Ulysses might but meet
‚Ä≠  With these proud wooers, all were at his feet
‚Ä≠  But instant dead men, and their nuptialls
‚Ä≠  Would prove as bitter as their dying galls.
‚Ä≠  But these things in the Gods‚Äô knees are repos‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  If his return shall see with wreak inclos‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  These in his house, or he return no more;
‚Ä≠  And therefore I advise thee to explore
‚Ä≠  All ways thyself, to set these wooers gone;
‚Ä≠  To which end give me fit attenti√≥n:
‚Ä≠  To-morrow into solemn council call
‚Ä≠  The Greek hero√´s, and declare to all
‚Ä≠  (The Gods being witness) what thy pleasure is.
‚Ä≠  Command to towns of their nativity
‚Ä≠  These frontless wooers.  If thy mother‚Äôs mind
‚Ä≠  Stands to her second nuptials so inclin‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Return she to her royal father‚Äôs tow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  Where th‚Äô one of these may wed her, and her dow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  Make rich, and such as may consort with grace
‚Ä≠  So dear a daughter of so great a race
‚Ä≠  And thee I warn as well (if thou as well
‚Ä≠  Wilt hear and follow) take thy best-built sail,
‚Ä≠  With twenty oars mann‚Äôd, and haste t‚Äô inquire
‚Ä≠  Where the abode is of thy absent sire,
‚Ä≠  If any can inform thee, or thine ear
‚Ä≠  From Jove the fame of his retreat may hear,
‚Ä≠  For chiefly Jove gives all that honours men.
‚Ä≠     To Pylos first be thy addression then,
‚Ä≠  To god-like Nestor; thence to Sparta haste,
‚Ä≠  To gold-lock‚Äôd Menelaus, who was last
‚Ä≠  Of all the brass-arm‚Äôd Greeks that sail‚Äôd from Troy;
‚Ä≠  And try from both these, if thou canst enjoy
‚Ä≠  News of thy sire‚Äôs return‚Äôd life anywhere,
‚Ä≠  Though sad thou suffer‚Äôst in his search a year.
‚Ä≠  If of his death thou hear‚Äôst, return thou home,
‚Ä≠  And to his memory erect a tomb,
‚Ä≠  Performing parent-rites, of feast and game,
‚Ä≠  Pompous, and such as best may fit his fame;
‚Ä≠  And then thy mother a fit husband give.
‚Ä≠  These past, consider how thou mayst deprive
‚Ä≠  Of worthless life these wooers in thy house,
‚Ä≠  By open force, or projects enginous.
‚Ä≠  Things childish fit not thee; th‚Äô art so no more.
‚Ä≠  Hast thou not heard, how all men did adore
‚Ä≠  Divine Orestes, after he had slain
‚Ä≠  √Ügisthus murd‚Äôring by a treach‚Äôrous train
‚Ä≠  His famous father?  Be then, my most lov‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Valiant and manly, ev‚Äôry way approv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  As great as he.  I see thy person fit,
‚Ä≠  Noble thy mind, and excellent thy wit,
‚Ä≠  All giv‚Äôn thee so to use and manage here
‚Ä≠  That ev‚Äôn past death they may their memories bear.
‚Ä≠  In meantime I‚Äôll descend to ship and men,
‚Ä≠  That much expect me.  Be observant then
‚Ä≠  Of my advice, and careful to maintain
‚Ä≠  In equal acts thy royal father‚Äôs reign.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Telemachus replied: ‚ÄúYou ope, fair guest,
‚Ä≠  A friend‚Äôs heart in your speech, as well exprest
‚Ä≠  As might a father serve t‚Äô inform his son;
‚Ä≠  All which sure place have in my memory won.
‚Ä≠  Abide yet, though your voyage calls away,
‚Ä≠  That, having bath‚Äôd, and dignified your stay
‚Ä≠  With some more honour, you may yet beside
‚Ä≠  Delight your mind by being gratified
‚Ä≠  With some rich present taken in your way,
‚Ä≠  That, as a jewel, your respect may lay
‚Ä≠  Up in your treasury, bestow‚Äôd by me,
‚Ä≠  As free friends use to guests of such degree.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúDetain me not,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúso much inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To haste my voyage.  What thy loved mind
‚Ä≠  Commands to give, at my return this way,
‚Ä≠  Bestow on me, that I directly may
‚Ä≠  Convey it home; which more of price to me
‚Ä≠  The more it asks my recompense to thee.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, away grey-eyed Minerva flew,
‚Ä≠  Like to a mounting lark; and did endue
‚Ä≠  His mind with strength and boldness, and much more
‚Ä≠  Made him his father long for than before;
‚Ä≠  And weighing better who his guest might be,
‚Ä≠  He stood amaz‚Äôd, and thought a Deity
‚Ä≠  Was there descended; to whose will he fram‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His pow‚Äôrs at all parts, and went so inflam‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Amongst the wooers, who were silent set,
‚Ä≠  To hear a poet sing the sad retreat
‚Ä≠  The Greeks perform‚Äôd from Troy; which was from thence
‚Ä≠  Proclaim‚Äôd by Pallas, pain of her offence.
‚Ä≠     When which divine song was perceiv‚Äôd to bear
‚Ä≠  That mournful subject by the list‚Äôning ear
‚Ä≠  Of wise Penelope, Icarius‚Äô seed,
‚Ä≠  Who from an upper room had giv‚Äôn it heed,
‚Ä≠  Down she descended by a winding stair,
‚Ä≠  Not solely, but the state in her repair
‚Ä≠  Two maids of honour made.  And when this queen
‚Ä≠  Of women stoop‚Äôd so low, she might be seen
‚Ä≠  By all her wooers.  In the door, aloof,
‚Ä≠  Ent‚Äôring the hall grac‚Äôd with a goodly roof,
‚Ä≠  She stood, in shade of graceful veils, implied
‚Ä≠  About her beauties; on her either side,
‚Ä≠  Her honour‚Äôd women.  When, to tears mov‚Äôd, thus
‚Ä≠  She chid the sacred singer: ‚ÄúPhemi√ºs,
‚Ä≠  You know a number more of these great deeds
‚Ä≠  Of Gods and men, that are the sacred seeds,
‚Ä≠  And proper subjects, of a poet‚Äôs song,
‚Ä≠  And those due pleasures that to men belong,
‚Ä≠  Besides these facts that furnish Troy‚Äôs retreat,
‚Ä≠  Sing one of those to these, that round your seat
‚Ä≠  They may with silence sit, and taste their wine;
‚Ä≠  But cease this song, that through these ears of mine
‚Ä≠  Conveys deserv‚Äôd occasion to my heart
‚Ä≠  Of endless sorrows, of which the desert
‚Ä≠  In me unmeasur‚Äôd is past all these men,
‚Ä≠  So endless is the memory I retain,
‚Ä≠  And so desertful is that memory,
‚Ä≠  Of such a man as hath a dignity
‚Ä≠  So broad it spreads itself through all the pride
‚Ä≠  Of Greece and Argos.‚Äù  To the queen replied
‚Ä≠  Inspir‚Äôd Telemachus:  ‚ÄúWhy thus envies
‚Ä≠  My mother him that fits societies  [9]
‚Ä≠  With so much harmony, to let him please
‚Ä≠  His own mind in his will to honour these?
‚Ä≠  For these ingenious and first sort of men,  [10]
‚Ä≠  That do immediately from Jove retain
‚Ä≠  Their singing raptures, are by Jove as well
‚Ä≠  Inspir‚Äôd with choice of what their songs impell,
‚Ä≠  Jove‚Äôs will is free in it, and therefore theirs.
‚Ä≠  Nor is this man to blame, that the repairs
‚Ä≠  The Greeks make homeward sings; for his fresh muse
‚Ä≠  Men still most celebrate that sings most news.
‚Ä≠     And therefore in his note your ears employ:
‚Ä≠  For not Ulysses only lost in Troy
‚Ä≠  The day of his return, but numbers more
‚Ä≠  The deadly ruins of his fortunes bore.
‚Ä≠  Go you then in, and take your work in hand,
‚Ä≠  Your web, and distaff; and your maids command
‚Ä≠  To ply their fit work.  Words to men are due,
‚Ä≠  And those reproving counsels you pursue,
‚Ä≠  And most to me of all men, since I bear
‚Ä≠  The rule of all things that are manag‚Äôd here.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  She went amaz‚Äôd away, and in her heart
‚Ä≠  Laid up the wisdom Pallas did impart
‚Ä≠  To her lov‚Äôd son so lately, turn‚Äôd again
‚Ä≠  Up to her chamber, and no more would reign
‚Ä≠  In manly counsels.  To her women she
‚Ä≠  Applied her sway; and to the wooers he
‚Ä≠  Began new orders, other spirits bewray‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Than those in spite of which the wooers sway‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  And (whiles his mother‚Äôs tears still wash‚Äôd her eyes,
‚Ä≠  Till grey Minerva did those tears surprise
‚Ä≠  With timely sleep, and that her wooers did rouse
‚Ä≠  Rude tumult up through all the shady house,
‚Ä≠  Dispos‚Äôd to sleep because their widow was)
‚Ä≠  Telemachus this new-giv‚Äôn spirit did pass
‚Ä≠  On their old insolence:  ‚ÄúHo! you that are,
‚Ä≠  My mother‚Äôs wooers!  much too high ye bear
‚Ä≠  Your petulant spirits; sit; and, while ye may
‚Ä≠  Enjoy me in your banquets, see ye lay
‚Ä≠  These loud notes down, nor do this man the wrong,
‚Ä≠  Because my mother hath disliked his song,
‚Ä≠  To grace her interruption.  ‚ÄôTis a thing
‚Ä≠  Honest, and honour‚Äôd too, to hear one sing
‚Ä≠  Numbers so like the Gods in elegance,
‚Ä≠  As this man flows in.  By the morn‚Äôs first light,  [11]
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll call ye all before me in a Court,
‚Ä≠  That I may clearly banish your resort,
‚Ä≠  With all your rudeness, from these roofs of mine.
‚Ä≠  Away; and elsewhere in your feasts combine.
‚Ä≠  Consume your own goods, and make mutual feast
‚Ä≠  At either‚Äôs house.  Or if ye still hold best,
‚Ä≠  And for your humours‚Äô more suffic√©d fill,
‚Ä≠  To feed, to spoil, because unpunish‚Äôd still,
‚Ä≠  On other findings, spoil; but here I call
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô Eternal Gods to witness, if it fall
‚Ä≠  In my wish‚Äôd reach once to be dealing wreaks,
‚Ä≠  By Jove‚Äôs high bounty, these your present checks
‚Ä≠  To what I give in charge shall add more reins
‚Ä≠  To my revenge hereafter; and the pains
‚Ä≠  Ye then must suffer shall pass all your pride
‚Ä≠  Ever to see redress‚Äôd, or qualified.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     At this all bit their lips, and did admire
‚Ä≠  His words sent from him with such phrase and fire;
‚Ä≠  Which so much mov‚Äôd them that Antinous,
‚Ä≠  Eupitheus‚Äô son, cried out:  ‚ÄúTelemachus!
‚Ä≠  The Gods, I think, have rapt thee to this height
‚Ä≠  Of elocution, and this great conceit
‚Ä≠  Of self-ability.  We all may pray,
‚Ä≠  That Jove invest not in this kingdom‚Äôs sway
‚Ä≠  Thy forward forces, which I see put forth
‚Ä≠  A hot ambition in thee for thy birth.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúBe not offended,‚Äù  he replied,  ‚Äúif I  [12]
‚Ä≠  Shall say, I would assume this empery,
‚Ä≠  If Jove gave leave.  You are not he that sings:
‚Ä≠  _The rule of kingdoms is the worst of things._
‚Ä≠  Nor is it ill, at all, to sway a throne;
‚Ä≠  A man may quickly gain possession
‚Ä≠  Of mighty riches, make a wondrous prize
‚Ä≠  Set of his virtues; but the dignities
‚Ä≠  That deck a king, there are enough beside
‚Ä≠  In this circumfluous isle that want no pride
‚Ä≠  To think them worthy of, as young as I,
‚Ä≠  And old as you are.  An ascent so high
‚Ä≠  My thoughts affect not.  Dead is he that held
‚Ä≠  Desert of virtue to have so excell‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  But of these turrets I will take on me
‚Ä≠  To be the absolute king, and reign as free,
‚Ä≠  As did my father, over all his hand
‚Ä≠  Left here in this house slaves to my command.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,
‚Ä≠  To this made this reply:  ‚ÄúTelemachus!
‚Ä≠  The girlond of this kingdom let the knees
‚Ä≠  Of Deity run for; but the faculties
‚Ä≠  This house is seis‚Äôd of, and the turrets here,
‚Ä≠  Thou shalt be lord of, nor shall any bear
‚Ä≠  The least part off of all thou dost possess,
‚Ä≠  As long as this land is no wilderness.
‚Ä≠  Nor rul‚Äôd by out-laws.  But give these their pass,
‚Ä≠  And tell me, best of princes, who he was
‚Ä≠  That guested here so late?  From whence?  And what
‚Ä≠  In any region boasted he his state?
‚Ä≠  His race?  His country?  Brought he any news
‚Ä≠  Of thy returning father?  Or for dues
‚Ä≠  Of moneys to him made he fit repair?
‚Ä≠  How suddenly he rush‚Äôd into the air,
‚Ä≠  Nor would sustain to stay and make him known!
‚Ä≠  His port show‚Äôd no debauch‚Äôd companion.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúThe return of my lov‚Äôd sire
‚Ä≠  Is past all hope; and should rude Fame inspire
‚Ä≠  From any place a flatt‚Äôring messenger
‚Ä≠  With news of his survival, he should bear
‚Ä≠  No least belief off from my desp‚Äôrate love.
‚Ä≠  Which if a sacred prophet should approve,
‚Ä≠  Call‚Äôd by my mother for her care‚Äôs unrest,
‚Ä≠  It should not move me.  For my late fair guest,
‚Ä≠  He was of old my father‚Äôs, touching here
‚Ä≠  From sea-girt Taphos; and for name doth bear
‚Ä≠  Mentas, the son of wise Anchialus;
‚Ä≠  And governs all the Taphians studious
‚Ä≠  Of navigation.‚Äù  This he said, but knew
‚Ä≠  It was a Goddess.  These again withdrew
‚Ä≠  To dances and attraction of the song;
‚Ä≠  And while their pleasures did the time prolong,
‚Ä≠  The sable Even descended, and did steep
‚Ä≠  The lids of all men in desire of sleep.
‚Ä≠     Telemachus, into a room built high,
‚Ä≠  Of his illustrious court, and to the eye
‚Ä≠  Of circular prospect, to his bed ascended,
‚Ä≠  And in his mind much weighty thought contended
‚Ä≠  Before him Euryclea (that well knew
‚Ä≠  All the observance of a handmaid‚Äôs due,
‚Ä≠  Daughter to Opis Pisenorides)
‚Ä≠  Bore two bright torches; who did so much please
‚Ä≠  La√´rtes in her prime, that, for the price
‚Ä≠  Of twenty oxen, he made merchandise
‚Ä≠  Of her rare beauties; and love‚Äôs equal flame,
‚Ä≠  To her he felt, as to his nuptial dame,
‚Ä≠  Yet never durst he mix with her in bed,
‚Ä≠  So much the anger of his wife he fled.
‚Ä≠  She, now grown old, to young Telemachus
‚Ä≠  Two torches bore, and was obsequious
‚Ä≠  Past all his other maids, and did apply
‚Ä≠  Her service to him from his infancy.
‚Ä≠  His well-built chamber reach‚Äôd, she op‚Äôd the door,
‚Ä≠  He on his bed sat, the soft weeds he wore
‚Ä≠  Put off, and to the diligent old maid
‚Ä≠  Gave all; who fitly all in thick folds laid,
‚Ä≠  And hung them on a beam-pin near the bed,
‚Ä≠  That round about was rich embroidered.
‚Ä≠  Then made she haste forth from him, and did bring
‚Ä≠  The door together with a silver ring,
‚Ä≠  And by a string a bar to it did pull.
‚Ä≠  He, laid, and cover‚Äôd well with curled wool
‚Ä≠  Wov‚Äôn in silk quilts, all night employ‚Äôd his mind
‚Ä≠  About the task that Pallas had design‚Äôd.

‚Ä≠  FINIS LIBRI PRIMI HOM. ODYSS.

‚Ä≠[1] The information or fashion of an absolute man; and necessary (or
‚Ä≠fatal) passage through many afflictions (according with the most
‚Ä≠Sacred Letter) to his natural haven and country, is the whole
‚Ä≠argument and scope of this inimitable and miraculous poem. And
‚Ä≠therefore is the epithet _œÄŒøŒª·ΩêœÑœÅŒøœÄŒøŒΩ_ given him in the first verse:
‚Ä≠_œÄŒøŒª·ΩêœÑœÅŒøœÄŒøœÇ_ signifying, _Homo cujus ingenium velut per multas
‚Ä≠et varias vias vertitur in verum._

‚Ä≠[2] These notes following I am forced to insert (since the words
‚Ä≠they contain differ from all other translations) lest I be thought to
‚Ä≠err out of that ignorance that may perhaps possess my depraver.

‚Ä≠[3] _‚ÄòŒëŒº·ΩëŒºŒøŒΩŒøœÇ_ translated in this place _inculpabilis,_ and made
‚Ä≠the epithet of √Ügisthus, is from the true sense of the word, as it is
‚Ä≠here to be understood; which is quite contrary.  As _·Ω∞ŒΩœÑ·Ω∑Œ∏ŒµŒøœÇ_ is
‚Ä≠to be expounded in some place _Divinus,_ or _Deo similis,_ but in
‚Ä≠another (soon after) _contrarius Deo._  The person to whom the
‚Ä≠epithet is given giving reason to distinguish it.  And so
‚Ä≠_·ΩÄŒªŒø·ΩÅœÜœÅœâŒΩ,_ an epithet given to Atlas, instantly following, in one
‚Ä≠place signifies _mente perniciosus,_ in the next, _qui universa
‚Ä≠mente gerit._

‚Ä≠[4] In this place is Atlas given the epithet _·ΩÄŒªŒø·ΩÅœÜœÅœâŒΩ,_ which
‚Ä≠signifies _qui universa mente agitat,_ here given him for the power
‚Ä≠the stars have in all things.  Yet this receives other interpretation in
‚Ä≠other places, as abovesaid.

‚Ä≠[5] _Œî·ΩêœÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩŒøœÇ_ is here turned by others, _infelix,_ in the general
‚Ä≠collection; when it hath here a particular exposition, applied to
‚Ä≠express Ulysses‚Äô desert errors, _‚ÄòœÄŒ±œÅ·ºÅ œÑ·ΩÅ œÉœÑ·º£ŒΩŒ±Œπ, ut sit, qui vix
‚Ä≠locum invenire potest ubi consistat._

‚Ä≠[6] This is thus translated, the rather to express and approve the
‚Ä≠allegory driven through the whole Odysseys.  Deciphering the
‚Ä≠intangling of the wisest in his affections; and the torments that
‚Ä≠breed in every pious mind; to be thereby hindered to arrive so
‚Ä≠directly as he desires, at the proper and only true natural country
‚Ä≠of every worthy man, whose haven is heaven and the next life, to
‚Ä≠which, this life is but a sea in continual √¶sture and vexation.  The
‚Ä≠words occasioning all this are _ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫Œø·º≥œÇ Œª·ΩÄŒªŒøŒπœÇ: ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫·ΩÄœÇ_
‚Ä≠signifying, _qui languide, et animo remisso rem aliquam gerit;_
‚Ä≠which being the effect of Calypso‚Äôs sweet words in Ulysses, is here
‚Ä≠applied passively to his own sufferance of their operation.

‚Ä≠[7] _·øûŒïœÅŒ∫ŒøœÇ ·ΩÄŒ¥·ΩÄŒΩœÑœâŒΩ,_ viz.  _vallum_ or _clanstrum dentium,_
‚Ä≠which, for the better sound in our language, is here turned, Pale of
‚Ä≠Ivory.  The teeth being that rampire, or pale, given us by nature in
‚Ä≠that part for restraint and compression of our speech, till the
‚Ä≠imagination, appetite, and soul (that ought to rule in their
‚Ä≠examination, before their delivery) have given worthy pass to
‚Ä≠them.  The most grave and divine poet, teaching therein, that not so
‚Ä≠much for the necessary chewing of our sustenance our teeth are
‚Ä≠given us, as for their stay of our words, lest we utter them rashly.

‚Ä≠[8] _Œ§·ΩÄœÉŒøœÇ œÄŒ±√ÆœÇ, Tantus filius._  Pallas thus enforcing her question
‚Ä≠to stir up the son the more to the father‚Äôs worthiness.

‚Ä≠[9] _‚ÄôŒïœÅ·º∞Œ∑œÅŒøœÇ ·ºÄŒøŒπŒ¥·ΩÄœÇ.  Cantor, cujus tam apta est societas
‚Ä≠hominibus._

‚Ä≠[10] _‚ÄôŒëŒΩŒ¥œÅ·ºÄœÉŒπŒΩ ·ºÄŒªœÜŒ∑œÉœÑ·æîœÉŒπŒΩ.  ‚ÄôŒëŒªœÜŒ∑œÉœÑ·æîœÉŒπŒΩ_ is an epithet proper to
‚Ä≠poets for their first finding out of arts and documents tending to
‚Ä≠elocution and government inspired only by Jove, and are here
‚Ä≠called the first of men, since first they gave rules to manly life, and
‚Ä≠have their information immediately from Jove (as Plato in Ione
‚Ä≠witnesseth); the word deduced from _·ºÖŒªœÜŒ±,_ which is taken for
‚Ä≠him _qui primas teneat aliqu√¢ in re,_ and will _·ºÄŒªœÜŒ∑œÉœÑ·øÉœÉŒπŒΩ_ then
‚Ä≠be sufficiently expressed with _ingeniosis,_ than which no
‚Ä≠exposition goes further.

‚Ä≠[11] _‚ÄôŒóœâŒ∏ŒµŒΩ, prima luce._

‚Ä≠[12] Upon this answer of Telemachus, because it hath so sudden a
‚Ä≠change and is so far let down from his late height of heat, altering
‚Ä≠and tempering so commandingly his affections I thought not amiss
‚Ä≠to insert here Spondanus‚Äô further annotations, which is this:
‚Ä≠_Prudenter Telemachus joco furorem Antinoi ac asperitatem
‚Ä≠emolliit.  Nam ita dictum illius interpretatur, ut existimetur censere
‚Ä≠jocos√® ilia etiam ab Antinoo adversum se pronunciata.  Et primum
‚Ä≠ironic√® se Regem esse exoptat propter commoda qu√¶ Reges solent
‚Ä≠comitari.  Ne tamen invidiam in se ambitionis concitet, testatur se
‚Ä≠regnum, Ithac√¶ non ambire, mortuo Ulysse, cum id alii possidere
‚Ä≠queant se longe pr√¶stantiores ac digniores: hoc unum ait se moliri,
‚Ä≠ut propriarum √¶dium et bonorum solus sit dominus, iis exclusis, ac
‚Ä≠ejectis, qui vi illa occupare ac disperdere conantur._



‚Ä≠  THE SECOND BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Telemachus to court doth call
‚Ä≠  The Wooers, and commands them all
‚Ä≠  To leave his house; and taking then
‚Ä≠  From wise Minerva ship and men,
‚Ä≠  And all things fit for him beside,
‚Ä≠  That Euryclea could provide
‚Ä≠  For sea-rites till he found his sire,
‚Ä≠  He hoists sail; when Heav‚Äôn stoops his fire.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _Œ≤Œ∑œÑŒ±._
‚Ä≠     The old Maid‚Äôs store
‚Ä≠        The voyage cheers.
‚Ä≠     The ship leaves shore,
‚Ä≠        Minerva steers.

‚Ä≠  Now when with rosy fingers, th‚Äô early born
‚Ä≠  And thrown through all the air, appear‚Äôd the Morn,
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô lov‚Äôd son from his bed appear‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  His weeds put on, and did about him gird
‚Ä≠  His sword that thwart his shoulders hung, and tied
‚Ä≠  To his fair feet fair shoes, and all parts plied
‚Ä≠  For speedy readiness: who, when he trod
‚Ä≠  The open earth, to men show‚Äôd like a God.
‚Ä≠     The heralds then he straight charg‚Äôd to consort
‚Ä≠  The curl‚Äôd-head Greeks, with loud calls, to a Court.
‚Ä≠  They summon‚Äôd; th‚Äô other came in utmost haste.
‚Ä≠  Who all assembled, and in one heap plac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  He likewise came to council, and did bear
‚Ä≠  In his fair hand his iron-headed spear.
‚Ä≠  Nor came alone, nor with men-troops prepar‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  But two fleet dogs made both his train and guard.
‚Ä≠  Pallas supplied with her high wisdom‚Äôs grace,
‚Ä≠  That all men‚Äôs wants supplies, State‚Äôs painted face.
‚Ä≠  His ent‚Äôring presence all men did admire;
‚Ä≠  Who took seat in the high throne of his sire,
‚Ä≠  To which the grave peers gave him rev‚Äôrend way.
‚Ä≠  Amongst whom, an Egyptian hero√´
‚Ä≠  (Crook√©d with age, and full of skill) begun
‚Ä≠  The speech to all; who had a loved son
‚Ä≠  That with divine Ulysses did ascend
‚Ä≠  His hollow fleet to Troy; to serve which end,
‚Ä≠  He kept fair horse, and was a man-at-arms,
‚Ä≠  And in the cruel Cyclop‚Äôs stern alarms
‚Ä≠  His life lost by him in his hollow cave,
‚Ä≠  Whose entrails open‚Äôd his abhorr√©d grave,
‚Ä≠  And made of him, of all Ulysses‚Äô train,
‚Ä≠  His latest supper, being latest slain;
‚Ä≠  His name was Antiphus, And this old man,
‚Ä≠  This crook√©d-grown, this wise Egyptian,
‚Ä≠  Had three sons more; of which one riotous
‚Ä≠  A wooer was, and call‚Äôd Eurynomus;
‚Ä≠  The other two took both his own wish‚Äôd course.
‚Ä≠  Yet both the best fates weigh‚Äôd not down the worse,
‚Ä≠  But left the old man mindful still of moan;
‚Ä≠  Who, weeping, thus bespake the Session:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHear, Ithacensians, all I fitly say:
‚Ä≠  Since our divine Ulysses‚Äô parting day
‚Ä≠  Never was council call‚Äôd, nor session,
‚Ä≠  And now by whom is this thus undergone?
‚Ä≠  Whom did necessity so much compell,
‚Ä≠  Of young or old?  Hath anyone heard tell
‚Ä≠  Of any coming army, that he thus now
‚Ä≠  May openly take boldness to avow,
‚Ä≠  First having heard it?  Or will any here
‚Ä≠  Some motion for the public good prefer?
‚Ä≠  Some worth of note there is in this command;
‚Ä≠  And, methinks, it must be some good man‚Äôs hand
‚Ä≠  That‚Äôs put to it, that either hath direct
‚Ä≠  Means to assist, or, for his good affect,
‚Ä≠  Hopes to be happy in the proof he makes;
‚Ä≠  And that Jove grant, whate‚Äôer he undertakes.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Telemachus (rejoicing much to hear
‚Ä≠  The good hope and opinion men did bear
‚Ä≠  Of his young actions) no longer sat,
‚Ä≠  But long‚Äôd t‚Äô approve what this man pointed at,
‚Ä≠  And make his first proof in a cause so good;
‚Ä≠  And in the council‚Äôs chief place up he stood;
‚Ä≠  When straight Pisenor (herald to his sire,
‚Ä≠  And learn‚Äôd in counsels) felt his heart on fire
‚Ä≠  To hear him speak, and put into his hand
‚Ä≠  The sceptre that his father did command;
‚Ä≠  Then, to the old Egyptian turn‚Äôd, he spoke:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúFather, not far he is that undertook
‚Ä≠  To call this Council; whom you soon shall know.
‚Ä≠  Myself, whose wrongs my griefs will make me show,
‚Ä≠  Am he that author‚Äôd this assembly here.
‚Ä≠  Nor have I heard of any army near,
‚Ä≠  Of which, being first told, I might iterate,
‚Ä≠  Nor for the public good can aught relate,
‚Ä≠  Only mine own affairs all this procure,
‚Ä≠  That in my house a double ill endure;
‚Ä≠  One, having lost a father so renown‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Whose kind rule once with‚Äô your command was crown‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  The other is, what much more doth augment
‚Ä≠  His weighty loss, the ruin imminent
‚Ä≠  Of all my house by it, my goods all spent.
‚Ä≠  And of all this the wooers, that are sons
‚Ä≠  To our chief peers, are the confusi√≥ns,
‚Ä≠  Importuning my mother‚Äôs marri√°ge
‚Ä≠  Against her will; nor dares their blood‚Äôs bold rage
‚Ä≠  Go to Icarius‚Äô, her father‚Äôs, court,
‚Ä≠  That, his will ask‚Äôd in kind and comely sort,
‚Ä≠  He may endow his daughter with a dow‚Äôr,
‚Ä≠  And, she consenting, at his pleasure‚Äôs pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  Dispose her to a man, that, thus behav‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  May have fit grace, and see her honour sav‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  But these, in none but my house, all their lives
‚Ä≠  Resolve to spend; slaught‚Äôring my sheep and beeves,
‚Ä≠  And with my fattest goats lay feast on feast,
‚Ä≠  My gen‚Äôrous wine consuming as they list.
‚Ä≠  A world of things they spoil, here wanting one,
‚Ä≠  That, like Ulysses, quickly could set gone
‚Ä≠  These peace-plagues from his house, that spoil like war;
‚Ä≠  Whom my pow‚Äôrs are unfit to urge so far,
‚Ä≠  Myself immartial.  But, had I the pow‚Äôr,
‚Ä≠  My will should serve me to exempt this hour
‚Ä≠  From out my life-time.  For, past patience,
‚Ä≠  Base deeds are done here, that exceed defence
‚Ä≠  Of any honour.  Falling is my house,
‚Ä≠  Which you should shame to see so ruinous.
‚Ä≠  Rev‚Äôrence the censures that all good men give,
‚Ä≠  That dwell about you; and for fear to live
‚Ä≠  Expos‚Äôd to heav‚Äôn‚Äôs wrath (that doth ever pay
‚Ä≠  Pains for joys forfeit) even by Jove I pray,
‚Ä≠  Or Themis, both which pow‚Äôrs have to restrain,
‚Ä≠  Or gather, councils, that ye will abstain
‚Ä≠  From further spoil, and let me only waste
‚Ä≠  In that most wretched grief I have embrac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  For my lost father.  And though I am free
‚Ä≠  From meriting your outrage, yet, if he,
‚Ä≠  Good man, hath ever with a hostile heart
‚Ä≠  Done ill to any Greek, on me convert
‚Ä≠  Your like hostility, and vengeance take
‚Ä≠  Of his ill on my life, and all these make
‚Ä≠  Join in that justice; but, to see abus‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Those goods that do none ill but being ill-us‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Exceeds all right.  Yet better ‚Äôtis for me,
‚Ä≠  My whole possessions and my rents to see
‚Ä≠  Consum‚Äôd by you, than lose my life and all;
‚Ä≠  For on your rapine a revenge may fall,
‚Ä≠  While I live; and so long I may complain
‚Ä≠  About the city, till my goods again,
‚Ä≠  Oft ask‚Äôd, may be with all amends repaid.
‚Ä≠  But in the mean space your misrule hath laid
‚Ä≠  Griefs on my bosom, that can only speak,
‚Ä≠  And are denied the instant pow‚Äôr of wreak.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, his sceptre ‚Äôgainst the ground he threw,
‚Ä≠  And tears still‚Äôd from him; which mov‚Äôd all the crew,
‚Ä≠  The court struck silent, not a man did dare
‚Ä≠  To give a word that might offend his ear.
‚Ä≠  Antinous only in this sort replied:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHigh spoken, and of spirit unpacified,
‚Ä≠  How have you sham‚Äôd us in this speech of yours!
‚Ä≠  Will you brand us for an offence not ours?
‚Ä≠  Your mother, first in craft, is first in cause.
‚Ä≠  Three years are past, and near the fourth now draws,
‚Ä≠  Since first she mock‚Äôd the peers Achaian.
‚Ä≠  All she made hope, and promis‚Äôd ev‚Äôry man,
‚Ä≠  Sent for us ever, left love‚Äôs show in nought,
‚Ä≠  But in her heart conceal‚Äôd another thought.
‚Ä≠  Besides, as curious in her craft, her loom
‚Ä≠  She with a web charg‚Äôd, hard to overcome,
‚Ä≠  And thus bespake us: ‚ÄòYouths, that seek my bed,
‚Ä≠  Since my divine spouse rests amongst the dead,
‚Ä≠  Hold on your suits but till I end, at most,
‚Ä≠  This funeral weed, lest what is done be lost.
‚Ä≠  Besides, I purpose, that when th‚Äô austere fate
‚Ä≠  Of bitter death shall take into his state
‚Ä≠  Laertes the hero√´, it shall deck
‚Ä≠  His royal corse, since I should suffer check
‚Ä≠  In ill report of ev‚Äôry common dame,
‚Ä≠  If one so rich should show in death his shame.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  This speech she us‚Äôd; and this did soon persuade
‚Ä≠  Our gentle minds.  But this a work she made
‚Ä≠  So hugely long, undoing still in night,
‚Ä≠  By torches, all she did by day‚Äôs broad light,
‚Ä≠  That three years her deceit div‚Äôd past our view,
‚Ä≠  And made us think that all she feign‚Äôd was true.
‚Ä≠  But when the fourth year came, and those sly hours
‚Ä≠  That still surprise at length dames‚Äô craftiest powers,
‚Ä≠  One of her women, that knew all, disclos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The secret to us, that she still unloos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Her whole day‚Äôs fair affair in depth of night.
‚Ä≠  And then no further she could force her sleight,
‚Ä≠  But, of necessity, her work gave end.
‚Ä≠  And thus, by me, doth ev‚Äôry other friend,
‚Ä≠  Professing love to her, reply to thee;
‚Ä≠  That ev‚Äôn thyself, and all Greeks else, may see,
‚Ä≠  That we offend not in our stay, but she.
‚Ä≠  To free thy house then, send her to her sire,
‚Ä≠  Commanding that her choice be left entire
‚Ä≠  To his election, and one settled will.
‚Ä≠  Nor let her vex with her illusions still
‚Ä≠  Her friends that woo her, standing on her wit,
‚Ä≠  Because wise Pallas hath giv‚Äôn wills to it
‚Ä≠  So full of art, and made her understand
‚Ä≠  All works in fair skill of a lady‚Äôs hand.
‚Ä≠  But (for her working mind) we read of none
‚Ä≠  Of all the old world, in which Greece hath shown
‚Ä≠  Her rarest pieces, that could equal her:
‚Ä≠  Tyro, Alcmena, and Mycena were
‚Ä≠  To hold comparison in no degree,
‚Ä≠  For solid brain, with wise Penelope.
‚Ä≠  And yet, in her delays of us, she shows
‚Ä≠  No prophet‚Äôs skill with all the wit she owes;
‚Ä≠  For all this time thy goods and victuals go
‚Ä≠  To utter ruin; and shall ever so,
‚Ä≠  While thus the Gods her glorious mind dispose.
‚Ä≠  Glory herself may gain, but thou shalt lose
‚Ä≠  Thy longings ev‚Äôn for necessary food,
‚Ä≠  For we will never go where lies our good,
‚Ä≠  Nor any other where, till this delay
‚Ä≠  She puts on all she quits with th‚Äô endless stay
‚Ä≠  Of some one of us, that to all the rest
‚Ä≠  May give free farewell with his nuptial feast.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The wise young prince replied:  ‚ÄúAntinous!
‚Ä≠  I may by no means turn out of my house
‚Ä≠  Her that hath brought me forth and nourish‚Äôd me.
‚Ä≠  Besides, if quick or dead my father be
‚Ä≠  In any region, yet abides in doubt;
‚Ä≠  And ‚Äôtwill go hard, my means being so run out,
‚Ä≠  To tender to Icarius again,
‚Ä≠  If he again my mother must maintain
‚Ä≠  In her retreat, the dow‚Äôr she brought with her.
‚Ä≠  And then a double ill it will confer,
‚Ä≠  Both from my father and from God on me,
‚Ä≠  When, thrust out of her house, on her bent knee,
‚Ä≠  My mother shall the horrid Furies raise
‚Ä≠  With imprecations, and all men dispraise
‚Ä≠  My part in her exposure.  Never then
‚Ä≠  Will I perform this counsel.  If your spleen
‚Ä≠  Swell at my courses, once more I command
‚Ä≠  Your absence from my house; some other‚Äôs hand
‚Ä≠  Charge with your banquets; on your own goods eat,
‚Ä≠  And either other mutually in treat,
‚Ä≠  At either of your houses, with your feast.
‚Ä≠  But if ye still esteem more sweet and best
‚Ä≠  Another‚Äôs spoil, so you still wreakless live,
‚Ä≠  Gnaw, vermin-like, things sacred, no laws give  [1]
‚Ä≠  To your devouring; it remains that I
‚Ä≠  Invoke each Ever-living Deity,
‚Ä≠  And vow, if Jove shall deign in any date
‚Ä≠  Pow‚Äôr of like pains for pleasure so past rate,
‚Ä≠  From thenceforth look, where ye have revell‚Äôd so
‚Ä≠  Unwreak‚Äôd, your ruins all shall undergo.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus spake Telemachus; t‚Äô assure whose threat,
‚Ä≠  Far-seeing Jove upon their pinions set
‚Ä≠  Two eagles from the high brows of a hill,
‚Ä≠  That, mounted on the Winds, together still
‚Ä≠  Their strokes extended; but arriving now
‚Ä≠  Amidst the Council, over ev‚Äôry brow
‚Ä≠  Shook their thick wings and, threat‚Äôning death‚Äôs cold fears,
‚Ä≠  Their necks and cheeks tore with their eager seres;
‚Ä≠  Then, on the court‚Äôs right hand away they flew,
‚Ä≠  Above both court and city.  With whose view,
‚Ä≠  And study what events they might foretell
‚Ä≠  The Council into admiration fell.
‚Ä≠  The old hero√´, Halitherses, then,
‚Ä≠  The son of Nestor, that of all old men,
‚Ä≠  His peers in that court, only could foresee
‚Ä≠  By flight of fowls man‚Äôs fixed destiny,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTwixt them and their amaze, this interpos‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHear, Ithacensians, all your doubts disclos‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  The Wooers most are touch‚Äôd in this ostent,
‚Ä≠  To whom are dangers great and imminent;
‚Ä≠  For now not long more shall Ulysses bear
‚Ä≠  Lack of his most lov‚Äôd, but fills some place near,
‚Ä≠  Addressing to these Wooers fate and death.
‚Ä≠  And many more this mischief menaceth
‚Ä≠  Of us inhabiting this famous isle.
‚Ä≠  Let us consult yet, in this long forewhile,
‚Ä≠  How to ourselves we may prevent this ill.
‚Ä≠  Let these men rest secure, and revel still;
‚Ä≠  Though they might find it safer, if with us
‚Ä≠  They would in time prevent what threats them thus;
‚Ä≠  Since not without sure trial I foretell
‚Ä≠  These coming storms, but know their issue well.
‚Ä≠  For to Ulysses all things have event,
‚Ä≠  As I foretold him, when for Ilion went
‚Ä≠  The whole Greek fleet together, and with them
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô abundant-in-all-counsels took the stream.
‚Ä≠  I told him, that, when much ill he had past,
‚Ä≠  And all his men were lost, he should at last,
‚Ä≠  The twentieth year, turn home, to all unknown;
‚Ä≠  All which effects are to perfection grown.‚Äù
‚Ä≠      Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,
‚Ä≠  Oppos‚Äôd this man‚Äôs presage, and answer‚Äôd thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHence, great in years, go, prophesy at home,
‚Ä≠  Thy children teach to shun their ills to come.
‚Ä≠  In these superior far to thee am I.
‚Ä≠  A world of fowls beneath the sun-beams fly
‚Ä≠  That are not fit t‚Äô inform a prophecy.
‚Ä≠  Besides, Ulysses perish‚Äôd long ago;
‚Ä≠  And would thy fates to thee had destin‚Äôd so,
‚Ä≠  Since so thy so much prophecy had spar‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Thy wronging of our rights, which, for reward
‚Ä≠  Expected home with thee, hath summon‚Äôd us
‚Ä≠  Within the anger of Telemachus.
‚Ä≠  But this I will presage, which shall be true:
‚Ä≠  If any spark of anger chance t‚Äô ensue
‚Ä≠  Thy much old art in these deep auguries,
‚Ä≠  In this young man incens√©d by thy lies,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn to himself his anger shall confer
‚Ä≠  The greater anguish, and thine own ends err
‚Ä≠  From all their objects; and, besides, thine age
‚Ä≠  Shall feel a pain, to make thee curse presage
‚Ä≠  With worthy cause, for it shall touch thee near.
‚Ä≠  But I will soon give end to all our fear,
‚Ä≠  Preventing whatsoever chance can fall,
‚Ä≠  In my suit to the young prince for us all,
‚Ä≠  To send his mother to her father‚Äôs house,
‚Ä≠  That he may sort her out a worthy spouse,
‚Ä≠  And such a dow‚Äôr bestow, as may befit
‚Ä≠  One lov‚Äôd, to leave her friends and follow it.
‚Ä≠  Before which course be, I believe that none
‚Ä≠  Of all the Greeks will cease th‚Äô ambiti√≥n
‚Ä≠  Of such a match.  For, chance what can to us,
‚Ä≠  We no man fear, no not Telemachus,
‚Ä≠  Though ne‚Äôer so greatly spoken.  Nor care we
‚Ä≠  For any threats of austere prophecy,
‚Ä≠  Which thou, old dotard, vaunt‚Äôst of so in vain.
‚Ä≠  And thus shalt thou in much more hate remain;
‚Ä≠  For still the Gods shall bear their ill expense,
‚Ä≠  Nor ever be dispos‚Äôd by competence,
‚Ä≠  Till with her nuptials she dismiss our suits,
‚Ä≠  Our whole lives‚Äô days shall sow hopes for such fruits.
‚Ä≠  Her virtues we contend to, nor will go
‚Ä≠  To any other, be she never so
‚Ä≠  Worthy of us, and all the worth we owe.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd him: ‚ÄúEurymachus, and all
‚Ä≠  Ye gen‚Äôrous Wooers, now, in general,
‚Ä≠  I see your brave resolves, and will no more
‚Ä≠  Make speech of these points, and, much less, implore.
‚Ä≠  It is enough, that all the Grecians here,
‚Ä≠  And all the Gods besides, just witness bear,
‚Ä≠  What friendly premonitions have been spent
‚Ä≠  On your forbearance, and their vain event.
‚Ä≠  Yet, with my other friends, let love prevail
‚Ä≠  To fit me with a vessel free of sail,
‚Ä≠  And twenty men, that may divide to me
‚Ä≠  My ready passage through the yielding sea
‚Ä≠  For Sparta, and Amathoan Pylos‚Äô shore,
‚Ä≠  I now am bound, in purpose to explore
‚Ä≠  My long-lack‚Äôd father, and to try if fame
‚Ä≠  Or Jove, most author of man‚Äôs honour‚Äôd name,
‚Ä≠  With his return and life may glad mine ear,
‚Ä≠  Though toil‚Äôd in that proof I sustain a year.
‚Ä≠  If dead I hear him, nor of more state, here
‚Ä≠  Retir‚Äôd to my lov‚Äôd country, I will rear
‚Ä≠  A sepulchre to him, and celebrate
‚Ä≠  Such royal parent-rites, as fits his state;
‚Ä≠  And then my mother to a spouse dispose.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he sat; and to the rest arose
‚Ä≠  Mentor, that was Ulysses‚Äô chosen friend,
‚Ä≠  To whom, when he set forth, he did commend
‚Ä≠  His c√≥mplete family, and whom he will‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To see the mind of his old sire fulfill‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  All things conserving safe, till his retreat.
‚Ä≠  Who, tender of his charge, and seeing so set
‚Ä≠  In slight care of their king his subjects there,
‚Ä≠  Suff‚Äôring his son so much contempt to bear,
‚Ä≠  Thus gravely, and with zeal, to him began:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúNo more let any sceptre-bearing man,
‚Ä≠  Benevolent, or mild, or human be,
‚Ä≠  Nor in his mind form acts of piety,
‚Ä≠  But ever feed on blood, and facts unjust
‚Ä≠  Commit, ev‚Äôn to the full swing of his lust,
‚Ä≠  Since of divine Ulysses no man now,
‚Ä≠  Of all his subjects, any thought doth show.
‚Ä≠  All whom he govern‚Äôd, and became to them,
‚Ä≠  Rather than one that wore a diadem,
‚Ä≠  A most indulgent father.  But, for all
‚Ä≠  That can touch me, within no envy fall
‚Ä≠  These insolent Wooers, that in violent kind
‚Ä≠  Commit things foul by th‚Äô ill wit of the mind,
‚Ä≠  And with the hazard of their heads devour
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô house, since his returning hour
‚Ä≠  They hold past hope.  But it affects me much,
‚Ä≠  Ye dull plebeians, that all this doth touch
‚Ä≠  Your free states nothing; who, struck dumb, afford
‚Ä≠  These Wooers not so much wreak as a word,
‚Ä≠  Though few, and you with only number might
‚Ä≠  Extinguish to them the profaned light.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Evenor‚Äôs son, Leocritus, replied:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúMentor!  the railer, made a fool with pride,
‚Ä≠  What language giv‚Äôst thou that would quiet us
‚Ä≠  With putting us in storm, exciting thus
‚Ä≠  The rout against us?  Who, though more than we,
‚Ä≠  Should find it is no easy victory
‚Ä≠  To drive men, habited in feast, from feasts,
‚Ä≠  No not if Ithacus himself such guests
‚Ä≠  Should come and find so furnishing his Court,
‚Ä≠  And hope to force them from so sweet a fort.
‚Ä≠  His wife should little joy in his arrive,
‚Ä≠  Though much she wants him; for, where she alive
‚Ä≠  Would her‚Äôs enjoy, there death should claim his rights.
‚Ä≠  _He must be conquer‚Äôd that with many fights._
‚Ä≠  Thou speak‚Äôst unfit things.  To their labours then
‚Ä≠  Disperse these people; and let these two men,
‚Ä≠  Mentor and Halitherses, that so boast
‚Ä≠  From the beginning to have govern‚Äôd most
‚Ä≠  In friendship of the father, to the son
‚Ä≠  Confirm the course he now affects to run.
‚Ä≠  But my mind says, that, if he would but use
‚Ä≠  A little patience, he should here hear news
‚Ä≠  Of all things that his wish would understand,
‚Ä≠  But no good hope for of the course in hand.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, the Council rose; when ev‚Äôry peer
‚Ä≠  And all the people in dispersion were
‚Ä≠  To houses of their own; the Wooers yet
‚Ä≠  Made to Ulysses‚Äô house their old retreat.
‚Ä≠     Telemachus, apart from all the prease,
‚Ä≠  Prepar‚Äôd to shore, and, in the aged seas
‚Ä≠  His fair hands wash‚Äôd, did thus to Pallas pray:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúHear me, O Goddess, that but yesterday
‚Ä≠  Didst deign access to me at home, and lay
‚Ä≠  Grave charge on me to take ship, and inquire
‚Ä≠  Along the dark seas for mine absent sire!
‚Ä≠  Which all the Greeks oppose; amongst whom most
‚Ä≠  Those that are proud still at another‚Äôs cost,
‚Ä≠  Past measure, and the civil rights of men,
‚Ä≠  My mother‚Äôs Wooers, my repulse maintain.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus spake he praying; when close to him came
‚Ä≠  Pallas, resembling Mentor both in frame
‚Ä≠  Of voice and person, and advis‚Äôd him thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúThose Wooers well might know, Telemachus,
‚Ä≠  Thou wilt not ever weak and childish be,
‚Ä≠  If to thee be instill‚Äôd the faculty
‚Ä≠  Of mind and body that thy father grac‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  And if, like him, there be in thee enchac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Virtue to give words works, and works their end.
‚Ä≠  This voyage, that to them thou didst commend,
‚Ä≠  Shall not so quickly, as they idly ween,
‚Ä≠  Be vain, or giv‚Äôn up, for their opposite spleen.
‚Ä≠  But, if Ulysses nor Penelope
‚Ä≠  Were thy true parents, I then hope in thee
‚Ä≠  Of no more urging thy attempt in hand;
‚Ä≠  For few, that rightly bred on both sides stand,
‚Ä≠  Are like their parents, many that are worse,
‚Ä≠  And most few better.  Those then that the nurse
‚Ä≠  Or mother call true-born yet are not so,
‚Ä≠  Like worthy sires much less are like to grow.
‚Ä≠  But thou show‚Äôst now that in thee fades not quite
‚Ä≠  Thy father‚Äôs wisdom; and that future light
‚Ä≠  Shall therefore show thee far from being unwise,
‚Ä≠  Or touch‚Äôd with stain of bastard cowardice.
‚Ä≠  Hope therefore says, that thou wilt to the end
‚Ä≠  Pursue the brave act thou didst erst intend.
‚Ä≠  But for the foolish Wooers, they bewray
‚Ä≠  They neither counsel have nor soul, since they
‚Ä≠  Are neither wise nor just, and so must needs
‚Ä≠  Rest ignorant how black above their heads
‚Ä≠  Fate hovers holding Death, that one sole day
‚Ä≠  Will make enough to make them all away.
‚Ä≠  For thee, the way thou wishest shall no more
‚Ä≠  Fly thee a step; I, that have been before
‚Ä≠  Thy father‚Äôs friend, thine likewise now will be,
‚Ä≠  Provide thy ship myself, and follow thee.
‚Ä≠  Go thou then home, and sooth each Wooer‚Äôs vein,
‚Ä≠  But under hand fit all things for the main;
‚Ä≠  Wine in as strong and sweet casks as you can,
‚Ä≠  And meal, the very marrow of a man,
‚Ä≠  Which put in good sure leather sacks, and see
‚Ä≠  That with sweet food sweet vessels still agree.
‚Ä≠  I from the people straight will press for you
‚Ä≠  Free voluntaries; and, for ships, enow
‚Ä≠  Sea-circled Ithaca contains, both new
‚Ä≠  And old-built; all which I‚Äôll exactly view,
‚Ä≠  And choose what one soever most doth please;
‚Ä≠  Which rigg‚Äôd, we‚Äôll straight launch, and assay the seas.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This spake Jove‚Äôs daughter, Pallas; whose voice heard,
‚Ä≠  No more Telemachus her charge deferr‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  But hasted home, and, sad at heart, did see
‚Ä≠  Amidst his hall th‚Äô insulting Wooers flea
‚Ä≠  Goats, and roast swine.  ‚ÄôMongst whom, Antinous
‚Ä≠  Careless, discov‚Äôring in Telemachus
‚Ä≠  His grudge to see them, laugh‚Äôd, met, took his hand,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúHigh-spoken, with the mind so mann‚Äôd!
‚Ä≠  Come, do as we do, put not up your spirits
‚Ä≠  With these low trifles, nor our loving merits
‚Ä≠  In gall of any hateful purpose steep,
‚Ä≠  But eat egregiously, and drink as deep.
‚Ä≠  The things thou think‚Äôst on, all at full shall be
‚Ä≠  By th‚Äô Achives thought on, and perform‚Äôd to thee;
‚Ä≠  Ship, and choice oars, that in a trice will land
‚Ä≠  Thy hasty fleet on heav‚Äônly Pylos‚Äô sand,
‚Ä≠  And at the fame of thy illustrious sire.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúMen, whom pride did so inspire,
‚Ä≠  Are not fit consorts for an humble guest;
‚Ä≠  Nor are constrain‚Äôd men merry at their feast.
‚Ä≠  Is ‚Äôt not enough, that all this time ye have
‚Ä≠  Op‚Äôd in your entrails my chief goods a grave,
‚Ä≠  And, while I was a child, made me partake?
‚Ä≠  My now more growth more grown my mind doth make,
‚Ä≠  And, hearing speak more judging men than you,
‚Ä≠  Perceive how much I was misgovern‚Äôd now.
‚Ä≠  I now will try if I can bring ye home
‚Ä≠  An ill Fate to consort you; if it come
‚Ä≠  From Pylos, or amongst the people here.
‚Ä≠  But thither I resolve, and know that there
‚Ä≠  I shall not touch in vain.  Nor will I stay,
‚Ä≠  Though in a merchant‚Äôs ship I steer my way;
‚Ä≠  Which shows in your sights best; since me ye know
‚Ä≠  Incapable of ship, or men to row.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, his hand he coyly snatch‚Äôd away
‚Ä≠  From forth Antinous‚Äô hand.  The rest the day
‚Ä≠  Spent through the house with banquets; some with jests,
‚Ä≠  And some with railings, dignifying their feasts.
‚Ä≠  To whom a jest-proud youth the wit began:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúTelemachus will kill us ev‚Äôry man.
‚Ä≠  From Sparta, to the very Pylian sand,
‚Ä≠  He will raise aids to his impetuous hand.
‚Ä≠  O he affects it strangely! Or he means
‚Ä≠  To search Ephyra‚Äôs fat shores, and from thence
‚Ä≠  Bring deathful poisons, which amongst our bowls
‚Ä≠  Will make a general shipwrack of our souls.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Another said:  ‚ÄúAlas, who knows but he
‚Ä≠  Once gone, and erring like his sire at sea,
‚Ä≠  May perish like him, far from aid of friends,
‚Ä≠  And so he makes us work?  For all the ends
‚Ä≠  Left of his goods here we shall share, the house
‚Ä≠  Left to his mother and her chosen spouse.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus they; while he a room ascended, high
‚Ä≠  And large, built by his father, where did lie
‚Ä≠  Gold and brass heap‚Äôd up, and in coffers were
‚Ä≠  Rich robes, great store of odorous oils, and there
‚Ä≠  Stood tuns of sweet old wines along the wall,
‚Ä≠  Neat and divine drink, kept to cheer with all
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô old heart, if he turn‚Äôd again
‚Ä≠  From labours fatal to him to sustain.
‚Ä≠  The doors of plank were, their close exquisite,
‚Ä≠  Kept with a double key, and day and night
‚Ä≠  A woman lock‚Äôd within; and that was she
‚Ä≠  Who all trust had for her sufficiency,
‚Ä≠  Old Euryclea, one of Opis‚Äô race,
‚Ä≠  Son to Pisenor, and in passing grace
‚Ä≠  With grey Minerva; her the prince did call,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúNurse! Draw me the most sweet of all
‚Ä≠  The wine thou keep‚Äôst; next that which for my sire
‚Ä≠  Thy care reserves, in hope he shall retire.
‚Ä≠  Twelve vessels fill me forth, and stop them well.
‚Ä≠  Then into well-sew‚Äôd sacks of fine ground meal
‚Ä≠  Pour twenty measures.  Nor, to anyone
‚Ä≠  But thee thyself, let this design be known.
‚Ä≠  All this see got together; I it all
‚Ä≠  In night will fetch off, when my mother shall
‚Ä≠  Ascend her high room, and for sleep prepare.
‚Ä≠  Sparta and Pylos I must see, in care
‚Ä≠  To find my father.‚Äù  Out Euryclea cried,
‚Ä≠  And ask‚Äôd with tears:  ‚ÄúWhy is your mind applied.
‚Ä≠  Dear son, to this course?  Whither will you go?
‚Ä≠  So far off leave us, and belov√©d so,
‚Ä≠  So only?  And the sole hope of your race?
‚Ä≠  Royal Ulysses, far from the embrace
‚Ä≠  Of his kind country, in a land unknown
‚Ä≠  Is dead; and, you from your lov‚Äôd country gone,
‚Ä≠  The Wooers will with some deceit assay
‚Ä≠  To your destruction, making then their prey
‚Ä≠  Of all your goods.  Where, in your own y‚Äôare strong,
‚Ä≠  Make sure abode.  It fits not you so young
‚Ä≠  To suffer so much by the aged seas,
‚Ä≠  And err in such a wayless wilderness.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúBe cheer‚Äôd, lov‚Äôd nurse,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúfor, not without
‚Ä≠  The will of God, go my attempts about.
‚Ä≠  Swear therefore, not to wound my mother‚Äôs ears
‚Ä≠  With word of this, before from heav‚Äôn appears
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô elev‚Äônth or twelfth light, or herself shall please
‚Ä≠  To ask of me, or hears me put to seas,
‚Ä≠  Lest her fair body with her woe be wore.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     To this the great oath of the Gods she swore;
‚Ä≠  Which having sworn, and of it every due
‚Ä≠  Perform‚Äôd to full, to vessels wine she drew,
‚Ä≠  And into well-sew‚Äôd sacks pour‚Äôd foody meal.
‚Ä≠  In mean time he, with cunning to conceal
‚Ä≠  All thought of this from others, himself bore
‚Ä≠  In broad house, with the Wooers, as before.
‚Ä≠     Then grey-eyed Pallas other thoughts did own,
‚Ä≠  And like Telemachus trod through the town,
‚Ä≠  Commanding all his men in th‚Äô even to be
‚Ä≠  Aboard his ship.  Again then question‚Äôd she
‚Ä≠  No√´non, fam‚Äôd for aged Phronius‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  About his ship; who all things to be done
‚Ä≠  Assur‚Äôd her freely should.  The sun then set,
‚Ä≠  And sable shadows slid through ev‚Äôry street,
‚Ä≠  When forth they launch‚Äôd, and soon aboard did bring
‚Ä≠  All arms, and choice of ev‚Äôry needful thing
‚Ä≠  That fits a well-rigg‚Äôd ship.  The Goddess then
‚Ä≠  Stood in the port‚Äôs extreme part, where her men,
‚Ä≠  Nobly appointed, thick about her came,
‚Ä≠  Whose ev‚Äôry breast she did with spirit enflame.
‚Ä≠  Yet still fresh projects laid the grey-eyed Dame.
‚Ä≠     Straight to the house she hasted, and sweet sleep
‚Ä≠  Pour‚Äôd on each Wooer; which so laid in steep
‚Ä≠  Their drowsy temples, that each brow did nod,
‚Ä≠  As all were drinking, and each hand his load,
‚Ä≠  The cup, let fall.  All start up, and to bed,
‚Ä≠  Nor more would watch, when sleep so surfeited
‚Ä≠  Their leaden eye-lids.  Then did Pallas call
‚Ä≠  Telemachus, in body, voice, and all,
‚Ä≠  Resembling Mentor, from his native nest,
‚Ä≠  And said, that all his arm‚Äôd men were addrest
‚Ä≠  To use their oars, and all expected now
‚Ä≠  He should the spirit of a soldier show.
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúCome then,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúno more let us defer
‚Ä≠  Our honour‚Äôd action.‚Äù  Then she took on her
‚Ä≠  A ravish‚Äôd spirit, and led as she did leap;
‚Ä≠  And he her most haste took out step by step.
‚Ä≠     Arrived at sea and ship, they found ashore
‚Ä≠  The soldiers that their fashion‚Äôd-long hair wore;
‚Ä≠  To whom the prince said: ‚ÄúCome, my friends, let‚Äôs bring
‚Ä≠  Our voyage‚Äôs provision; ev‚Äôry thing
‚Ä≠  Is heap‚Äôd together in our court; and none,
‚Ä≠  No not my mother, nor her maids, but one
‚Ä≠  Knows our intention.‚Äù This express‚Äôd, he led,
‚Ä≠  The soldiers close together followed;
‚Ä≠  And all together brought aboard their store.
‚Ä≠  Aboard the prince went; Pallas still before
‚Ä≠  Sat at the stern, he close to her, the men
‚Ä≠  Up hasted after.  He and Pallas then
‚Ä≠  Put from the shore.  His soldiers then he bad
‚Ä≠  See all their arms fit; which they heard, and had.
‚Ä≠     A beechen mast, then, in the hollow base
‚Ä≠  They put, and hoisted, fix‚Äôd it in its place
‚Ä≠  With cables; and with well-wreath‚Äôd halsers hoise
‚Ä≠  Their white sails, which grey Pallas now employs
‚Ä≠  With full and fore-gales through the dark deep main.
‚Ä≠  The purple waves, so swift cut, roar‚Äôd again
‚Ä≠  Against the ship sides, that now ran and plow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The rugged seas up.  Then the men bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Their arms about the ship, and sacrifice
‚Ä≠  With crown‚Äôd wine-cups to th‚Äô endless Deities
‚Ä≠  They offer‚Äôd up.  Of all yet thron‚Äôd above,
‚Ä≠  They most observ‚Äôd the grey-eyed seed of Jove;
‚Ä≠  Who, from the evening till the morning rose,
‚Ä≠  And all day long their voyage did dispose.

‚Ä≠  THE THIRD BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Telemachus, and Heav‚Äôn‚Äôs wise Dame
‚Ä≠  That never husband had, now came
‚Ä≠  To Nestor; who his either guest
‚Ä≠  Receiv‚Äôd at the religious feast
‚Ä≠  He made to Neptune, on his shore;
‚Ä≠  And there told what was done before
‚Ä≠  The Trojan turrets, and the state
‚Ä≠  Of all the Greeks since Ilion‚Äôs fate.
‚Ä≠  This book these three of greatest place
‚Ä≠  Doth serve with many a varied grace.
‚Ä≠  Which past, Minerva takes her leave.
‚Ä≠  Whose state when Nestor doth perceive,
‚Ä≠  With sacrifice he makes it known,
‚Ä≠  Where many a pleasing rite is shown.
‚Ä≠  Which done, Telemachus hath gain‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A chariot of him; who ordain‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Pisistratus, his son, his guide
‚Ä≠  To Sparta; and when starry eyed
‚Ä≠  The ample heav‚Äôn began to be,
‚Ä≠  All house-rites to afford them free,
‚Ä≠  In Pheris, Diocles did please,
‚Ä≠  His surname Ortilochides.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _Œì·ºÄŒºŒºŒ±._
‚Ä≠     Ulysses‚Äô son
‚Ä≠        With Nestor lies,
‚Ä≠     To Sparta gone;
‚Ä≠        Thence Pallas flies.

‚Ä≠  The sun now left the great and goodly lake,
‚Ä≠  And to the firm heav‚Äôn bright ascent did make,
‚Ä≠  To shine as well upon the mortal birth,
‚Ä≠  Inhabiting the plow‚Äôd life-giving earth,
‚Ä≠  As on the ever-treaders upon death.
‚Ä≠  And now to Pylos, that so garnisheth
‚Ä≠  Herself with buildings, old Neleus‚Äô town,
‚Ä≠  The prince and Goddess come had strange sights shown,
‚Ä≠  For, on the marine shore, the people there
‚Ä≠  To Neptune, that the azure locks doth wear,
‚Ä≠  Beeves that were wholly black gave holy flame.
‚Ä≠  Nine seats of state they made to his high name;
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôry seat set with five hundred men,
‚Ä≠  And each five hundred was to furnish then
‚Ä≠  With nine black oxen ev‚Äôry sacred seat.
‚Ä≠  These of the entrails only pleas‚Äôd to eat,
‚Ä≠  And to the God enflam‚Äôd the fleshy thighs.
‚Ä≠     By this time Pallas with the sparkling eyes,
‚Ä≠  And he she led, within the haven bore,
‚Ä≠  Struck sail, cast anchor, and trod both the shore,
‚Ä≠  She first, he after.  Then said Pallas:  ‚ÄúNow
‚Ä≠  No more befits thee the least bashful brow;
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô embolden which this act is put on thee,
‚Ä≠  To seek thy father both at shore and sea,
‚Ä≠  And learn in what clime he abides so close,
‚Ä≠  Or in the pow‚Äôr of what Fate doth repose.
‚Ä≠     Come then, go right to Nestor; let us see,
‚Ä≠  If in his bosom any counsel be,
‚Ä≠  That may inform us. Pray him not to trace
‚Ä≠  The common courtship, and to speak in grace
‚Ä≠  Of the demander, but to tell the truth;
‚Ä≠  Which will delight him, and commend thy youth
‚Ä≠  For such prevention; for he loves no lies,
‚Ä≠  Nor will report them, being truly wise.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúMentor!  how, alas!  shall I
‚Ä≠  Present myself?   How greet his gravity?
‚Ä≠  My youth by no means that ripe form affords,
‚Ä≠  That can digest my mind‚Äôs instinct in words
‚Ä≠  Wise, and beseeming th‚Äô ears of one so sage.
‚Ä≠  Youth of most hope blush to use words with age.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She said:  ‚ÄúThy mind will some conceit impress,
‚Ä≠  And something God will prompt thy towardness;
‚Ä≠  For, I suppose, thy birth, and breeding too,
‚Ä≠  Were not in spite of what the Gods could do.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, she swiftly went before, and he
‚Ä≠  Her steps made guides, and follow‚Äôd instantly.
‚Ä≠  When soon they reach‚Äôd the Pylian throngs and seats,
‚Ä≠  Where Nestor with his sons sat; and the meats,
‚Ä≠  That for the feast serv‚Äôd, round about them were
‚Ä≠  Adherents dressing, all their sacred cheer,
‚Ä≠  Being roast and boil‚Äôd meats.  When the Pylians saw
‚Ä≠  These strangers come, in thrust did all men draw
‚Ä≠  About their entry, took their hands, and pray‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  They both would sit; their entry first assay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By Nestor‚Äôs son, Pisistratus.  In grace
‚Ä≠  Of whose repair, he gave them honour‚Äôd place
‚Ä≠  Betwixt his sire and brother Thrasymed,
‚Ä≠  Who sat at feast on soft fells that were spread
‚Ä≠  Along the sea sands, kerv‚Äôd, and reach‚Äôd to them
‚Ä≠  Parts of the inwards, and did make a stream
‚Ä≠  Of spritely wine into a golden bowl;
‚Ä≠  Which to Minerva with a gentle soul
‚Ä≠  He gave, and thus spake:  ‚ÄúEre you eat, fair guest,
‚Ä≠  Invoke the Seas‚Äô King, of whose sacred feast
‚Ä≠  Your travel hither makes ye partners now;
‚Ä≠  When, sacrificing as becomes, bestow
‚Ä≠  This bowl of sweet wine on your friend, that he
‚Ä≠  May likewise use these rites of piety;
‚Ä≠  For I suppose his youth doth prayers use,
‚Ä≠  Since all men need the Gods.  But you I choose
‚Ä≠  First in this cup‚Äôs disposure, since his years
‚Ä≠  Seem short of yours, who more like me appears.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Thus gave he her the cup of pleasant wine;
‚Ä≠  And since a wise and just man did design
‚Ä≠  The golden bowl first to her free receit,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn to the Goddess it did add delight,
‚Ä≠  Who thus invok‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúHear thou, whose vast embrace
‚Ä≠  Enspheres the whole earth, nor disdain thy grace
‚Ä≠  To us that ask it in performing this:
‚Ä≠  To Nestor first, and these fair sons of his,
‚Ä≠  Vouchsafe all honour; and, next them, bestow
‚Ä≠  On all these Pylians, that have offer‚Äôd now
‚Ä≠  This most renowned hecatomb to thee,
‚Ä≠  Remuneration fit for them, and free;
‚Ä≠  And lastly deign Telemachus and me,
‚Ä≠  The work perform‚Äôd for whose effect we came,
‚Ä≠  Our safe return, both with our ship and fame.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Thus pray‚Äôd she; and herself herself obey‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  In th‚Äô end performing all for which she pray‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  And now, to pray, and do as she had done,
‚Ä≠  She gave the fair round bowl t‚Äô Ulysses‚Äô son.
‚Ä≠     The meat then dress‚Äôd, and drawn, and serv‚Äôd t‚Äô each guest,
‚Ä≠  They celebrated a most sumptuous feast.
‚Ä≠  When appetite to wine and food allay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Horse-taming Nestor then began, and said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúNow life‚Äôs desire is serv‚Äôd, as far as fare,
‚Ä≠  Time fits me to enquire what guests these are.
‚Ä≠  Fair guests, what are ye?  And for what coast tries
‚Ä≠  Your ship the moist deeps?  For fit merchandise?
‚Ä≠  Or rudely coast ye, like our men of prise,
‚Ä≠  The rough seas tempting, desperately erring,
‚Ä≠  The ill of others in their good conferring?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The wise prince now his boldness did begin,
‚Ä≠  For Pallas‚Äô self had harden‚Äôd him within,
‚Ä≠  By this device of travel to explore
‚Ä≠  His absent father; which two girlonds wore;
‚Ä≠  His good by manage of his spirits; and then
‚Ä≠  To gain him high grace in th‚Äô accounts of men.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO Nestor!  still in whom Nel√´us lives!
‚Ä≠  And all the glory of the Greeks survives,
‚Ä≠  You ask from whence we are, and I relate:
‚Ä≠  From Ithaca (whose seat is situate
‚Ä≠  Where Neius, the renown√©d mountain, rears
‚Ä≠  His haughty forehead, and the honour bears
‚Ä≠  To be our sea-mark) we assay‚Äôd the waves.
‚Ä≠  The business, I must tell, our own good craves,
‚Ä≠  And not the public.  I am come t‚Äô enquire,
‚Ä≠  If, in the fame that best men doth inspire
‚Ä≠  Of my most-suff‚Äôring father, I may hear
‚Ä≠  Some truth of his estate now, who did bear
‚Ä≠  The name, being join‚Äôd in fight with you alone,
‚Ä≠  To even with earth the height of Ilion.
‚Ä≠  Of all men else, that any name did bear,
‚Ä≠  And fought for Troy, the sev‚Äôral ends we hear;
‚Ä≠  But his death Jove keeps from the world unknown,
‚Ä≠  The certain fame thereof being told by none;
‚Ä≠  If on the continent by enemies slain,
‚Ä≠  Or with the waves eat of the ravenous main.
‚Ä≠  For his love ‚Äôtis that to your knees I sue,
‚Ä≠  That you would please, out of your own clear view,
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô assure his sad end; or say, if your ear
‚Ä≠  Hath heard of the unhappy wanderer,
‚Ä≠  To too much sorrow whom his mother bore.
‚Ä≠  You then by all your bounties I implore,
‚Ä≠  (If ever to you deed or word hath stood,
‚Ä≠  By my good father promis‚Äôd, render‚Äôd good
‚Ä≠  Amongst the Trojans, where ye both have tried
‚Ä≠  The Grecian suff‚Äôrance) that in nought applied
‚Ä≠  To my respect or pity you will glose,
‚Ä≠  But uncloth‚Äôd truth to my desires disclose.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO my much-lov‚Äôd,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúsince you renew
‚Ä≠  Remembrance of the miseries that grew
‚Ä≠  Upon our still-in-strength-opposing Greece
‚Ä≠  Amongst Troy‚Äôs people, I must touch a piece
‚Ä≠  Of all our woes there, either in the men
‚Ä≠  Achilles brought by sea and led to gain
‚Ä≠  About the country, or in us that fought
‚Ä≠  About the city, where to death were brought
‚Ä≠  All our chief men, as many as were there.
‚Ä≠  There Mars-like Ajax lies; Achilles there;
‚Ä≠  There the in-counsel-like-the-Gods, his friend;
‚Ä≠  There my dear son Antilochus took end,
‚Ä≠  Past measure swift of foot, and staid in fight.
‚Ä≠  A number more that ills felt infinite;
‚Ä≠  Of which to reckon all, what mortal man,
‚Ä≠  If five or six years you should stay here, can
‚Ä≠  Serve such enquiry?  You would back again,
‚Ä≠  Affected with unsufferable pain,
‚Ä≠  Before you heard it.  Nine years sieg‚Äôd we them,
‚Ä≠  With all the depth and sleight of stratagem
‚Ä≠  That could be thought.  Ill knit to ill past end.
‚Ä≠  Yet still they toil‚Äôd us; nor would yet Jove send
‚Ä≠  Rest to our labours, nor will scarcely yet.
‚Ä≠  But no man liv‚Äôd, that would in public set
‚Ä≠  His wisdom by Ulysses‚Äô policy,
‚Ä≠  As thought his equal; so excessively
‚Ä≠  He stood superior all ways.  If you be
‚Ä≠  His son indeed, mine eyes ev‚Äôn ravish me
‚Ä≠  To admiration.  And in all consent
‚Ä≠  Your speech puts on his speech‚Äôs ornament.
‚Ä≠  Nor would one say, that one so young could use,
‚Ä≠  Unless his son, a rhetoric so profuse.
‚Ä≠  And while we liv‚Äôd together, he and I
‚Ä≠  Never in speech maintain‚Äôd diversity;
‚Ä≠  Nor sat in council but, by one soul led,
‚Ä≠  With spirit and prudent counsel furnish√©d
‚Ä≠  The Greeks at all hours, that, with fairest course,
‚Ä≠  What best became them, they might put in force.
‚Ä≠  But when Troy‚Äôs‚Äô high tow‚Äôrs we had levell‚Äôd thus,
‚Ä≠  We put to sea, and God divided us.
‚Ä≠  And then did Jove our sad retreat devise;
‚Ä≠  For all the Greeks were neither just nor wise,
‚Ä≠  And therefore many felt so sharp a fate,
‚Ä≠  Sent from Minerva‚Äôs most pernicious hate;
‚Ä≠  Whose mighty Father can do fearful things.
‚Ä≠  By whose help she betwixt the brother kings
‚Ä≠  Let fall contention; who in council met
‚Ä≠  In vain, and timeless, when the sun was set,
‚Ä≠  And all the Greeks call‚Äôd, that came charg‚Äôd with wine.
‚Ä≠  Yet then the kings would utter their design,
‚Ä≠  And why they summon‚Äôd.  Menelaus, he
‚Ä≠  Put all in mind of home, and cried, To sea.
‚Ä≠  But Agamemnon stood on contraries,
‚Ä≠  Whose will was, they should stay and sacrifice
‚Ä≠  Whole hecatombs to Pallas, to forego
‚Ä≠  Her high wrath to them.  Fool!  that did not know
‚Ä≠  She would not so be won; for not with ease
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô Eternal Gods are turn‚Äôd from what they please.
‚Ä≠  So they, divided, on foul language stood.
‚Ä≠  The Greeks in huge rout rose, their wine-heat blood
‚Ä≠  Two ways affecting.  And, that night‚Äôs sleep too,
‚Ä≠  We turn‚Äôd to studying either other‚Äôs woe;
‚Ä≠  When Jove besides made ready woes enow.
‚Ä≠  Morn came, we launch‚Äôd, and in our ships did stow
‚Ä≠  Our goods, and fair-girt women.  Half our men
‚Ä≠  The people‚Äôs guide, Atrides, did contain,
‚Ä≠  And half, being now aboard, put forth to sea.
‚Ä≠  A most free gale gave all ships prosp‚Äôrous way.
‚Ä≠  God settled then the huge whale-bearing lake,
‚Ä≠  And Tenedos we reach‚Äôd; where, for time‚Äôs sake,
‚Ä≠  We did divine rites to the Gods.  But Jove,
‚Ä≠  Inexorable still, bore yet no love
‚Ä≠  To our return, but did again excite
‚Ä≠  A second sad contention, that turn‚Äôd quite
‚Ä≠  A great part of us back to sea again;
‚Ä≠  Which were th‚Äô abundant-in-all-counsels man,
‚Ä≠  Your matchless father, who, to gratify
‚Ä≠  The great Atrides, back to him did fly.
‚Ä≠  But I fled all, with all that follow‚Äôd me,
‚Ä≠  Because I knew God studied misery,
‚Ä≠  To hurl amongst us.  With me likewise fled
‚Ä≠  Martial Tydides.  I the men he led
‚Ä≠  Gat to go with him.  Winds our fleet did bring
‚Ä≠  To Lesbos, where the yellow-headed king,
‚Ä≠  Though late, yet found us, as we put to choice
‚Ä≠  A tedious voyage; if we sail should hoise
‚Ä≠  Above rough Chius, left on our left hand,
‚Ä≠  To th‚Äô isle of Psyria, or that rugged land
‚Ä≠  Sail under, and for windy Mimas steer.
‚Ä≠  We ask‚Äôd of God that some ostent might clear
‚Ä≠  Our cloudy business, who gave us sign,
‚Ä≠  And charge, that all should, in a middle line,
‚Ä≠  The sea cut for Eub≈ìa, that with speed
‚Ä≠  Our long-sustain‚Äôd infortune might be freed.
‚Ä≠  Then did a whistling wind begin to rise,
‚Ä≠  And swiftly flew we through the fishy skies,
‚Ä≠  Till to Ger√¶stus we in night were brought;
‚Ä≠  Where, through the broad sea since we safe had wrought,
‚Ä≠  At Neptune‚Äôs altars many solid thighs
‚Ä≠  Of slaughter‚Äôd bulls we burn‚Äôd for sacrifice.
‚Ä≠     The fourth day came, when Tydeus‚Äô son did greet
‚Ä≠  The haven of Argos with his c√≥mplete fleet.
‚Ä≠  But I for Pylos straight steer‚Äôd on my course;
‚Ä≠  Nor ever left the wind his foreright force,
‚Ä≠  Since God fore-sent it first.  And thus I came,
‚Ä≠  Dear son, to Pylos, uninform‚Äôd by fame,
‚Ä≠  Nor know one sav‚Äôd by Fate, or overcome.
‚Ä≠  Whom I have heard of since, set here at home,
‚Ä≠  As fits, thou shalt be taught, nought left unshown.
‚Ä≠     The expert spear-men, ev‚Äôry Myrmidon,
‚Ä≠  Led by the brave heir of the mighty-soul‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Unpeer‚Äôd Achilles, safe of home got hold;
‚Ä≠  Safe Philoctetes, P≈ìan‚Äôs famous seed;
‚Ä≠  And safe Idomen√¶us his men led
‚Ä≠  To his home, Crete, who fled the arm√©d field,
‚Ä≠  Of whom yet none the sea from him withheld.
‚Ä≠     Atrides, you have both heard, though ye be
‚Ä≠  His far-off dwellers, what an end had he,
‚Ä≠  Done by √Ügisthus to a bitter death;
‚Ä≠  Who miserably paid for forc√©d breath,
‚Ä≠  Atrides leaving a good son, that dyed,
‚Ä≠  In blood of that deceitful parricide,
‚Ä≠  His wreakful sword.  And thou my friend, as he
‚Ä≠  For this hath his fame, the like spirit in thee
‚Ä≠  Assume at all parts.  Fair and great, I see,
‚Ä≠  Thou art in all hope, make it good to th‚Äô end,
‚Ä≠  That after-times as much may thee commend.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúO thou greatest grace of Greece,
‚Ä≠  Orestes made that wreak his master-piece,
‚Ä≠  And him the Greeks will give a master-praise,
‚Ä≠  Verse finding him to last all after-days.
‚Ä≠  And would to God the Gods would favour me
‚Ä≠  With his performance, that my injury,
‚Ä≠  Done by my mother‚Äôs Wooers, being so foul,
‚Ä≠  I might revenge upon their ev‚Äôry soul;
‚Ä≠  Who, pressing me with contumelies, dare
‚Ä≠  Such things as past the pow‚Äôr of utt‚Äôrance are.
‚Ä≠  But Heav‚Äôn‚Äôs great Pow‚Äôrs have grac‚Äôd my destiny
‚Ä≠  With no such honour.  Both my sire and I
‚Ä≠  Are born to suffer everlastingly.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúBecause you name those Wooers, friend,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúReport says, many such, in spite of thee,
‚Ä≠  Wooing thy mother, in thy house commit
‚Ä≠  The ills thou nam‚Äôst.  But say:  Proceedeth it
‚Ä≠  From will in thee to bear so foul a foil?
‚Ä≠  Or from thy subjects‚Äô hate, that wish thy spoil,
‚Ä≠  And will not aid thee, since their spirits rely,
‚Ä≠  Against thy rule, on some grave augury?
‚Ä≠  What know they, but at length thy father may
‚Ä≠  Come, and with violence their violence pay;
‚Ä≠  Or he alone, or all the Greeks with him?
‚Ä≠  But if Minerva now did so esteem
‚Ä≠  Thee, as thy father in times past; whom, past
‚Ä≠  All measure, she with glorious favours grac‚Äôt
‚Ä≠  Amongst the Trojans, where we suffer‚Äôd so;
‚Ä≠  (O!  I did never see, in such clear show,
‚Ä≠  The Gods so grace a man, as she to him,
‚Ä≠  To all our eyes, appear‚Äôd in all her trim)
‚Ä≠  If so, I say, she would be pleas‚Äôd to love,
‚Ä≠  And that her mind‚Äôs care thou so much couldst move,
‚Ä≠  As did thy father, ev‚Äôry man of these
‚Ä≠  Would lose in death their seeking marriages.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO father,‚Äù  answer‚Äôd he,  ‚Äúyou make amaze
‚Ä≠  Seize me throughout.  Beyond the height of phrase
‚Ä≠  You raise expression; but ‚Äôtwill never be,
‚Ä≠  That I shall move in any Deity
‚Ä≠  So blest an honour.  Not by any means,
‚Ä≠  If Hope should prompt me, or blind Confidence,
‚Ä≠  (The Gods of Fools) or ev‚Äôry Deity
‚Ä≠  Should will it; for ‚Äôtis past my destiny.‚Äù
‚Ä≠      The burning-eyed Dame answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúWhat a speech
‚Ä≠  Hath past the teeth-guard Nature gave to teach
‚Ä≠  Fit question of thy words before they fly!
‚Ä≠  God easily can  [1]  (when to mortal eye
‚Ä≠  He‚Äôs furthest off) a mortal satisfy;
‚Ä≠  And does the more still.  For thy car‚Äôd-for sire,
‚Ä≠  I rather wish, that I might home retire,
‚Ä≠  After my suff‚Äôrance of a world of woes,
‚Ä≠  Far off, and then my glad eyes might disclose
‚Ä≠  The day of my return, then straight retire,
‚Ä≠  And perish standing by my household fire;
‚Ä≠  As Agamemnon did, that lost his life
‚Ä≠  By false √Ügisthus, and his falser wife.
‚Ä≠     For Death to come at length, ‚Äôtis due to all;
‚Ä≠  Nor can the Gods themselves, when Fate shall call
‚Ä≠  Their most-lov‚Äôd man, extend his vital breath
‚Ä≠  Beyond the fix‚Äôd bounds of abhorr√©d Death.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúMentor!‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúlet‚Äôs dwell no more on this,
‚Ä≠  Although in us the sorrow pious is.
‚Ä≠  No such return, as we wish, Fates bequeath
‚Ä≠  My erring father; whom a present death
‚Ä≠  The Deathless have decreed.  I‚Äôll now use speech
‚Ä≠  That tends to other purpose; and beseech
‚Ä≠  Instruction of grave Nestor, since he flows
‚Ä≠  Past shore in all experience, and knows
‚Ä≠  The sleights and wisdoms, and whose heights aspire
‚Ä≠  Others, as well as my commended sire,
‚Ä≠  Whom Fame reports to have commanded three
‚Ä≠  Ages of men, and doth in sight to me
‚Ä≠  Show like th‚Äô Immortals.  Nestor!  the renown
‚Ä≠  Of old Neleius, make the clear truth known,
‚Ä≠  How the most-great-in-empire, Atreus‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  Sustain‚Äôd the act of his destruction,
‚Ä≠  Where then was Menelaus?  How was it
‚Ä≠  That false √Ügisthus, being so far unfit
‚Ä≠  A match for him, could his death so enforce?
‚Ä≠  Was he not then in Argos?  or his course
‚Ä≠  With men so left, to let a coward breathe
‚Ä≠  Spirit enough to dare his brother‚Äôs death?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell thee truth in all, fair son,‚Äù  said he:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúRight well was this event conceiv‚Äôd by thee.
‚Ä≠  If Menelaus in his brother‚Äôs house
‚Ä≠  Had found the idle liver with his spouse,
‚Ä≠  Arriv‚Äôd from Troy, he had not liv‚Äôd, nor dead
‚Ä≠  Had the digg‚Äôd heap pour‚Äôd on his lustful head,
‚Ä≠  But fowls and dogs had torn him in the fields,
‚Ä≠  Far off of Argos; not a dame it yields
‚Ä≠  Had giv‚Äôn him any tear, so foul his fact
‚Ä≠  Show‚Äôd ev‚Äôn to women.  Us Troy‚Äôs wars had rack‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To ev‚Äôry sinew‚Äôs sufferance, while he
‚Ä≠  In Argos‚Äô uplands liv‚Äôd, from those works free,
‚Ä≠  And Agamemnon‚Äôs wife with force of word
‚Ä≠  Flatter‚Äôd and soften‚Äôd, who, at first, abhorr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A fact so infamous.  The heav‚Äônly dame
‚Ä≠  A good mind had, but was in blood to blame.
‚Ä≠  There was a poet, to whose care the king
‚Ä≠  His queen committed, and in ev‚Äôry thing,
‚Ä≠  When he from Troy went, charg‚Äôd him to apply
‚Ä≠  Himself in all guard to her dignity.
‚Ä≠  But when strong Fate so wrapt-in her effects,
‚Ä≠  That she resolv‚Äôd to leave her fit respects,
‚Ä≠  Into a desert isle her guardian led,
‚Ä≠  There left, the rapine of the vultures fed.
‚Ä≠  Then brought he willing home his will‚Äôs won prize,
‚Ä≠  On sacred altars offer‚Äôd many thighs,
‚Ä≠  Hung in the God‚Äôs fanes many ornaments,
‚Ä≠  Garments and gold, that he the vast events
‚Ä≠  Of such a labour to his wish had brought,
‚Ä≠  As neither fell into his hope nor thought.
‚Ä≠     At last, from Troy sail‚Äôd Sparta‚Äôs king and I,
‚Ä≠  Both holding her untouch‚Äôd.  And, that his eye
‚Ä≠  Might see no worse of her, when both were blown
‚Ä≠  To sacred Sunium, of Minerva‚Äôs town
‚Ä≠  The goodly promontory, with his shafts severe
‚Ä≠  Augur Apollo slew him that did steer
‚Ä≠  Atrides‚Äô ship, as he the stern did guide,
‚Ä≠  And she the full speed of her sail applied.
‚Ä≠  He was a man that nati√≥ns of men
‚Ä≠  Excell‚Äôd in safe guide of a vessel, when
‚Ä≠  A tempest rush‚Äôd in on the ruffled seas;
‚Ä≠  His name was Phrontis Onetorides.
‚Ä≠  And thus was Menelaus held from home,
‚Ä≠  Whose way he thirsted so to overcome,
‚Ä≠  To give his friend the earth, being his pursuit,
‚Ä≠  And all his exequies to execute.
‚Ä≠  But sailing still the wine-hued seas,  [2]  to reach
‚Ä≠  Some shore for fit performance, he did fetch
‚Ä≠  The steep mount of the Malians, and there,
‚Ä≠  With open voice, offended Jupiter
‚Ä≠  Proclaim‚Äôd the voyage his repugnant mind,
‚Ä≠  And pour‚Äôd the puffs out of a shrieking wind,
‚Ä≠  That nourish‚Äôd billows heighten‚Äôd like to hills;
‚Ä≠  And with the fleet‚Äôs division fulfills
‚Ä≠  His hate proclaim‚Äôd; upon a part of Crete
‚Ä≠  Casting the navy, where the sea-waves meet
‚Ä≠  Rough Jardanus, and where the Cydons live.
‚Ä≠     There is a rock, on which the sea doth drive,
‚Ä≠  Bare, and all broken, on the confines set
‚Ä≠  Of Gortys, that the dark seas likewise fret;
‚Ä≠  And hither sent the South a horrid drift
‚Ä≠  Of waves against the top, that was the left
‚Ä≠  Of that torn cliff as far as Ph√¶stus‚Äô strand.
‚Ä≠  A little stone the great sea‚Äôs rage did stand.
‚Ä≠  The men here driv‚Äôn ‚Äòscap‚Äôd hard the ship‚Äôs sore shocks,
‚Ä≠  The ships themselves being wrack‚Äôd against the rocks,
‚Ä≠  Save only five, that blue fore-castles bore,
‚Ä≠  Which wind and water cast on Egypt‚Äôs shore.
‚Ä≠  When he (there victling well, and store of gold
‚Ä≠  Aboard his ships brought) his wild way did hold,
‚Ä≠  And t‚Äô other languag‚Äôd men was forc‚Äôd to roam.
‚Ä≠  Mean space √Ügisthus made sad work at home,
‚Ä≠  And slew his brother, forcing to his sway
‚Ä≠  Atrides‚Äô subjects, and did sev‚Äôn years lay
‚Ä≠  His yoke upon the rich Mycenian state.
‚Ä≠  But in the eighth, to his affrighting fate,
‚Ä≠  Divine Orestes home from Athens came,
‚Ä≠  And what his royal father felt, the same
‚Ä≠  He made the false √Ügisthus groan beneath.
‚Ä≠  _Death evermore is the reward of death._
‚Ä≠     Thus having slain him, a sepulchral feast
‚Ä≠  He made the Argives for his lustful guest,
‚Ä≠  And for his mother whom he did detest.
‚Ä≠  The self-same day upon him stole the king
‚Ä≠  Good-at-a-martial-shout, and goods did bring,
‚Ä≠  As many as his freighted fleet could bear.
‚Ä≠  But thou, my son, too long by no means err,
‚Ä≠  Thy goods left free for many a spoilful guest,
‚Ä≠  Lest they consume some, and divide the rest,
‚Ä≠  And thou, perhaps, besides, thy voyage lose.
‚Ä≠  To Menelaus yet thy course dispose
‚Ä≠  I wish and charge thee; who but late arriv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  From such a shore and men, as to have liv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In a return from them he never thought,
‚Ä≠  And whom black whirlwinds violently brought
‚Ä≠  Within a sea so vast, that in a year
‚Ä≠  Not any fowl could pass it anywhere,
‚Ä≠  So huge and horrid was it.  But go thou
‚Ä≠  With ship and men (or, if thou pleasest now
‚Ä≠  To pass by land, there shall be brought for thee
‚Ä≠  Both horse and chariot, and thy guides shall be
‚Ä≠  My sons themselves) to Sparta the divine,
‚Ä≠  And to the king whose locks like amber shine.
‚Ä≠  Intreat the truth of him, nor loves he lies,
‚Ä≠  Wisdom in truth is, and he‚Äôs passing wise.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, the Sun went down, and up rose Night,
‚Ä≠  When Pallas spake:  ‚ÄúO father, all good right
‚Ä≠  Bear thy directions.  But divide we now
‚Ä≠  The sacrifices‚Äô tongues, mix wines, and vow
‚Ä≠  To Neptune, and the other Ever-Blest,
‚Ä≠  That, having sacrific‚Äôd, we may to rest.
‚Ä≠  The fit hour runs now, light dives out of date,
‚Ä≠  At sacred feasts we must not sit too late.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She said; they heard; the heralds water gave;
‚Ä≠  The youths crown‚Äôd cups with wine, and let all have
‚Ä≠  Their equal shares, beginning from the cup
‚Ä≠  Their parting banquet.  All the tongues cut up,
‚Ä≠  The fire they gave them, sacrific‚Äôd, and rose,
‚Ä≠  Wine, and divine rites us‚Äôd, to each dispose;
‚Ä≠  Minerva and Telemachus desir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  They might to ship be, with his leave, retir‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     He, mov‚Äôd with that, provok‚Äôd thus their abodes:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúNow Jove forbid, and all the long-liv‚Äôd Gods,
‚Ä≠  Your leaving me, to sleep aboard a ship;
‚Ä≠  As I had drunk of poor Penia‚Äôs whip,
‚Ä≠  Even to my nakedness, and had nor sheet
‚Ä≠  Nor cov‚Äôring in my house; that warm nor sweet
‚Ä≠  A guest, nor I myself, had means to sleep;
‚Ä≠  Where I, both weeds and wealthy cov‚Äôrings keep
‚Ä≠  For all my guests.  Nor shall Fame ever say,
‚Ä≠  The dear son of the man Ulysses lay
‚Ä≠  All night a-ship-board here while my days shine,
‚Ä≠  Or in my court whiles any son of mine
‚Ä≠  Enjoys survival, who shall guests receive,
‚Ä≠  Whomever my house hath a nook to leave.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúMy much-lov‚Äôd father,‚Äù  said Minerva,  ‚Äúwell
‚Ä≠  All this becomes thee.  But persuade to dwell
‚Ä≠  This night with thee thy son Telemachus,
‚Ä≠  For more convenient is the course for us,
‚Ä≠  That he may follow to thy house and rest,
‚Ä≠  And I may board our black-sail, that addrest
‚Ä≠  At all parts I may make our men, and cheer
‚Ä≠  All with my presence, since of all men there
‚Ä≠  I boast myself the senior, th‚Äô others are
‚Ä≠  Youths, that attend in free and friendly care
‚Ä≠  Great-soul‚Äôd Telemachus, and are his peers
‚Ä≠  In fresh similitude of form and years.
‚Ä≠  For their confirmance, I will therefore now
‚Ä≠  Sleep in our black bark.  But, when light shall show
‚Ä≠  Her silver forehead, I intend my way
‚Ä≠  Amongst the Caucons, men that are to pay
‚Ä≠  A debt to me, nor small, nor new.  For this,
‚Ä≠  Take you him home; whom in the morn dismiss,
‚Ä≠  With chariot and your sons, and give him horse
‚Ä≠  Ablest in strength, and of the speediest course‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, away she flew, form‚Äôd like the fowl
‚Ä≠  Men call the ossifrage; when ev‚Äôry soul
‚Ä≠  Amaze invaded; even th‚Äô old man admir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  The youth‚Äôs hand took, and said:  ‚ÄúO most desir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  My hope says thy proof will no coward show,
‚Ä≠  Nor one unskill‚Äôd in war, when Deities now
‚Ä≠  So young attend thee, and become thy guides;
‚Ä≠  Nor any of the heav‚Äôn-hous‚Äôd States besides,
‚Ä≠  But Tritogenia‚Äôs self, the Seed of Jove,
‚Ä≠  The great-in-prey, that did in honour move
‚Ä≠  So much about thy father, amongst all
‚Ä≠  The Grecian army.  Fairest queen, let fall
‚Ä≠  On me like favours! Give me good renown!
‚Ä≠  Which, as on me, on my lov‚Äôd wife let down,
‚Ä≠  And all my children.  I will burn to thee
‚Ä≠  An ox right bred, broad-headed, and yoke-free,
‚Ä≠  To no man‚Äôs hand yet humbled.  Him will I,
‚Ä≠  His horns in gold hid, give thy Deity.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus pray‚Äôd he, and she heard; and home he led
‚Ä≠  His sons, and all his heaps of kindered.
‚Ä≠  Who ent‚Äôring his court royal, ev‚Äôry one
‚Ä≠  He marshall‚Äôd in his sev‚Äôral seat and throne;
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôry one, so kindly come, he gave
‚Ä≠  His sweet-wine cup; which none was let to have
‚Ä≠  Before his ‚Äòleventh year landed him from Troy;
‚Ä≠  Which now the butleress had leave t‚Äô employ,
‚Ä≠  Who therefore pierc‚Äôd it, and did give it vent.
‚Ä≠  Of this the old duke did a cup present
‚Ä≠  To ev‚Äôry guest; made his Maid many a pray‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  That wears the shield fring‚Äôd with his nurse‚Äôs hair,
‚Ä≠  And gave her sacrifice.  With this rich wine
‚Ä≠  And food suffic‚Äôd, sleep all eyes did decline,
‚Ä≠  And all for home went; but his court alone
‚Ä≠  Telemachus, divine Ulysses‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  Must make his lodging, or not please his heart.
‚Ä≠     A bed, all chequer‚Äôd with elaborate art,
‚Ä≠  Within a portico that rung like brass,
‚Ä≠  He brought his guest to; and his bedfere was
‚Ä≠  Pisistratus, the martial guide of men,
‚Ä≠  That liv‚Äôd, of all his sons, unwed till then.
‚Ä≠  Himself lay in a by-room, far above,
‚Ä≠  His bed made by his barren wife, his love.
‚Ä≠     The rosy-finger‚Äôd Morn no sooner shone,
‚Ä≠  But up he rose, took air, and sat upon
‚Ä≠  A seat of white and goodly polish‚Äôd stone,
‚Ä≠  That such a gloss as richest ointments wore,
‚Ä≠  Before his high gates; where the counsellor
‚Ä≠  That match‚Äôd the Gods (his father) us‚Äôd to sit,
‚Ä≠  Who now, by fate forc‚Äôd, stoop‚Äôd as low as it.
‚Ä≠  And here sat Nestor, holding in his hand
‚Ä≠  A sceptre; and about him round did stand,
‚Ä≠  As early up, his sons‚Äô troop; Perseus,
‚Ä≠  The god-like Thrasymed, and Aretus,
‚Ä≠  Echephron, Stratius, and sixth and last
‚Ä≠  Pisistratus, and by him (half embrac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Still as they came) divine Telemachus;
‚Ä≠  To these spake Nestor, old Gerenius:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHaste, lov√©d sons, and do me a desire,
‚Ä≠  That, first of all the Gods, I may aspire
‚Ä≠  To Pallas‚Äô favour, who vouchsaf‚Äôd to me
‚Ä≠  At Neptune‚Äôs feast her sight so openly.
‚Ä≠  Let one to field go, and an ox with speed
‚Ä≠  Cause hither brought, which let the herdsman lead;
‚Ä≠  Another to my dear guest‚Äôs vessel go,
‚Ä≠  And all his soldiers bring, save only two;
‚Ä≠  A third the smith that works in gold command
‚Ä≠  (Laertius) to attend, and lend his hand,
‚Ä≠  To plate the both horns round about with gold;
‚Ä≠  The rest remain here close.  But first, see told
‚Ä≠  The maids within, that they prepare a feast,
‚Ä≠  Set seats through all the court, see straight addrest
‚Ä≠  The purest water, and get fuel fell‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, not one but in the service held
‚Ä≠  Officious hand.  The ox came led from field;
‚Ä≠  The soldiers troop‚Äôd from ship; the smith he came,
‚Ä≠  And those tools brought that serv‚Äôd the actual frame
‚Ä≠  His art conceiv‚Äôd, brought anvil, hammers brought,
‚Ä≠  Fair tongs, and all, with which the gold was wrought.
‚Ä≠  Minerva likewise came, to set the crown
‚Ä≠  On that kind sacrifice, and make ‚Äôt her own.
‚Ä≠     Then th‚Äô old knight Nestor gave the smith the gold,
‚Ä≠  With which he straight did both the horns infold,
‚Ä≠  And trimm‚Äôd the off‚Äôring so, the Goddess joy‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  About which thus were Nestor‚Äôs sons employ‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠  Divine Echephron, and fair Stratius,
‚Ä≠  Held both the horns.  The water odorous,
‚Ä≠  In which they wash‚Äôd, what to the rites was vow‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Aretus, in a caldron all bestrow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With herbs and flowers, serv‚Äôd in from th‚Äô holy room
‚Ä≠  Where all were drest, and whence the rites must come.
‚Ä≠  And after him a hallow‚Äôd virgin came,
‚Ä≠  That brought the barley-cake, and blew the flame.
‚Ä≠  The axe, with which the ox should both be fell‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  And cut forth, Thrasymed stood by and held.
‚Ä≠  Perseus the vessel held that should retain
‚Ä≠  The purple liquor of the off‚Äôring slain.
‚Ä≠     Then wash‚Äôd the pious father, then the cake
‚Ä≠  (Of barley, salt, and oil, made) took, and brake,
‚Ä≠  Ask‚Äôd many a boon of Pallas, and the state
‚Ä≠  Of all the off‚Äôring did initiate,
‚Ä≠  In three parts cutting off the hair, and cast
‚Ä≠  Amidst the flame.  All th‚Äô invocation past,
‚Ä≠  And all the cake broke, manly Thrasymed
‚Ä≠  Stood near, and sure, and such a blow he laid
‚Ä≠  Aloft the off‚Äôring, that to earth he sunk,
‚Ä≠  His neck-nerves sunder‚Äôd, and his spirits shrunk.
‚Ä≠  Out shriek‚Äôd the daughters, daughter-in-laws, and wife
‚Ä≠  Of three-ag‚Äôd Nestor, who had eldest life
‚Ä≠  Of Clymen‚Äôs daughters, chaste Eurydice.
‚Ä≠  The ox on broad earth then laid laterally
‚Ä≠  They held, while duke Pisistratus the throat
‚Ä≠  Dissolv‚Äôd, and set the sable blood afloat,
‚Ä≠  And then the life the bones left.  Instantly
‚Ä≠  They cut him up; apart flew either thigh,
‚Ä≠  That with the fat they dubb‚Äôd, with art alone,
‚Ä≠  The throat-brisk, and the sweet-bread pricking on.
‚Ä≠  Then Nestor broil‚Äôd them on the coal-turn‚Äôd wood,
‚Ä≠  Pour‚Äôd black wine on; and by him young men stood,
‚Ä≠  That spits fine-pointed held, on which, when burn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The solid thighs were, they transfix‚Äôd, and turn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The inwards, cut in cantles; which, the meat
‚Ä≠  Vow‚Äôd to the Gods consum‚Äôd, they roast and eat.
‚Ä≠     In mean space, Polycast√© (call‚Äôd the fair,
‚Ä≠  Nestor‚Äôs young‚Äôst daughter) bath‚Äôd Ulysses‚Äô heir;
‚Ä≠  Whom having cleans‚Äôd, and with rich balms bespread,
‚Ä≠  She cast a white shirt quickly o‚Äôer his head,
‚Ä≠  And then his weeds put on; when forth he went,
‚Ä≠  And did the person of a God present,
‚Ä≠  Came, and by Nestor took his honour‚Äôd seat,
‚Ä≠  This pastor of the people.  Then, the meat
‚Ä≠  Of all the spare parts roasted, off they drew,
‚Ä≠  Sat, and fell to.  But soon the temp‚Äôrate few
‚Ä≠  Rose, and in golden bowls fill‚Äôd others wine.
‚Ä≠  Till, when the rest felt thirst of feast decline,
‚Ä≠  Nestor his sons bad fetch his high-man‚Äôd horse,
‚Ä≠  And them in chariot join, to run the course
‚Ä≠  The prince resolv‚Äôd.  Obey‚Äôd, as soon as heard,
‚Ä≠  Was Nestor by his sons, who straight prepar‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Both horse and chariot.  She that kept the store,
‚Ä≠  Both bread and wine, and all such viands more,
‚Ä≠  As should the feast of Jove-fed kings compose,
‚Ä≠  Purvey‚Äôd the voyage.  To the rich coach rose
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô son, and close to him ascended
‚Ä≠  The duke Pisistratus, the reins intended,
‚Ä≠  And scourg‚Äôd, to force to field, who freely flew;
‚Ä≠  And left the town that far her splendour threw,
‚Ä≠  Both holding yoke, and shook it all the day.
‚Ä≠  But now the sun set, dark‚Äôning ev‚Äôry way,
‚Ä≠  When they to Pheris came; and in the house
‚Ä≠  Of Diocles (the son t‚Äô Orsilochus,
‚Ä≠  Whom flood Alph√´us got) slept all that night;
‚Ä≠  Who gave them each due hospitable rite.
‚Ä≠  But when the rosy-finger‚Äôd Morn arose,
‚Ä≠  They went to coach, and did their horse inclose,
‚Ä≠  Drave forth the fore-court, and the porch that yields
‚Ä≠  Each breath a sound, and to the fruitful fields
‚Ä≠  Rode scourging still their willing flying steeds,
‚Ä≠  Who strenuously perform‚Äôd their wonted speeds.
‚Ä≠  Their journey ending just when sun went down,
‚Ä≠  And shadows all ways through the earth were thrown.

‚Ä≠  THE FOURTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Receiv‚Äôd now in the Spartan court,
‚Ä≠  Telemachus prefers report
‚Ä≠  To Menelaus of the throng
‚Ä≠  Of Wooers with him, and their wrong.
‚Ä≠  Atrides tells the Greeks‚Äô retreat,
‚Ä≠  And doth a prophecy repeat
‚Ä≠  That Proteus made, by which he knew
‚Ä≠  His brother‚Äôs death; and then doth show
‚Ä≠  How with Calypso liv‚Äôd the sire
‚Ä≠  Of his young guest.  The Wooers conspire
‚Ä≠  Their prince‚Äôs death. Whose treach‚Äôry known,
‚Ä≠  Penelope in tears doth drown.
‚Ä≠  Whom Pallas by a dream doth cheer,
‚Ä≠  And in similitude appear
‚Ä≠  Of fair Iphthima, known to be
‚Ä≠  The sister of Penelope.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _Œî·ºêŒªœÑŒ±._
‚Ä≠     Here of the sire
‚Ä≠        The son doth hear.
‚Ä≠     The Wooers conspire.
‚Ä≠        The Mother‚Äôs fear.

‚Ä≠  In Laced√¶mon now, the nurse of whales,  [1]
‚Ä≠  These two arriv‚Äôd, and found at festivals,
‚Ä≠  With mighty concourse, the renown√©d king,
‚Ä≠  His son and daughter jointly marrying.
‚Ä≠  Alector‚Äôs daughter he did give his son,
‚Ä≠  Strong Megapenthes, who his life begun
‚Ä≠  By Menelaus‚Äô bondmaid; whom he knew
‚Ä≠  In years when Helen could no more renew
‚Ä≠  In issue like divine Hermione,
‚Ä≠  Who held in all fair form as high degree
‚Ä≠  As golden Venus.  Her he married now
‚Ä≠  To great Achilles‚Äô son, who was by vow
‚Ä≠  Betroth‚Äôd to her at Troy, And thus the Gods
‚Ä≠  To constant loves give nuptial periods.
‚Ä≠  Whose state here past, the Myrmidons‚Äô rich town
‚Ä≠  (Of which she shar‚Äôd in the imperial crown)
‚Ä≠  With horse and chariots he resign‚Äôd her to.
‚Ä≠  Mean space, the high huge house with feast did flow
‚Ä≠  Of friends and neighbours, joying with the king.
‚Ä≠  Amongst whom did a heav‚Äônly poet sing,
‚Ä≠  And touch his harp.  Amongst whom likewise danc‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Two, who in that dumb motion advanc‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Would prompt the singer what to sing and play.  [2]
‚Ä≠  All this time in the utter court did stay,
‚Ä≠  With horse and chariot, Telemachus,
‚Ä≠  And Nestor‚Äôs noble son Pisistratus.
‚Ä≠  Whom Eteoneus, coming forth, descried,
‚Ä≠  And, being a servant to the king, most tried
‚Ä≠  In care and his respect, he ran and cried:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúGuests, Jove-kept Menelaus, two such men
‚Ä≠  As are for form of high Saturnius‚Äô strain.
‚Ä≠  Inform your pleasure, if we shall unclose
‚Ä≠  Their horse from coach, or say they must dispose
‚Ä≠  Their way to some such house, as may embrace
‚Ä≠  Their known arrival with more welcome grace?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He, angry, answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúThou didst never show
‚Ä≠  Thyself a fool, Boethides, till now;
‚Ä≠  But now, as if turn‚Äôd child, a childish speech
‚Ä≠  Vents thy vain spirits.  We ourselves now reach
‚Ä≠  Our home by much spent hospitality
‚Ä≠  Of other men; nor know if Jove will try
‚Ä≠  With other after-wants our state again;
‚Ä≠  And therefore from our feast no more detain
‚Ä≠  Those welcome guests, but take their steeds from coach,
‚Ä≠  And with attendance guide in their approach.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he rush‚Äôd abroad, and call‚Äôd some more
‚Ä≠  Tried in such service, that together bore
‚Ä≠  Up to the guests, and took their steeds that swet
‚Ä≠  Beneath their yokes from coach; at mangers set,
‚Ä≠  Wheat and white barley gave them mix‚Äôd; and plac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Their chariot by a wall so clear, it cast
‚Ä≠  A light quite through it.  And then they led
‚Ä≠  Their guests to the divine house; which so fed
‚Ä≠  Their eyes at all parts with illustrious sights,
‚Ä≠  That admiration seiz‚Äôd them.  Like the lights
‚Ä≠  The sun and moon gave, all the palace threw
‚Ä≠  A lustre through it.  Satiate with whose view,
‚Ä≠  Down to the king‚Äôs most bright-kept baths they went,
‚Ä≠  Where handmaids did their services present,
‚Ä≠  Bath‚Äôd, balm‚Äôd them, shirts and well-napt weeds put on,
‚Ä≠  And by Atrides‚Äô side set each his throne.
‚Ä≠  Then did the handmaid-royal water bring,
‚Ä≠  And to a laver, rich and glittering,
‚Ä≠  Of massy gold, pour‚Äôd; which she plac‚Äôd upon
‚Ä≠  A silver caldron, into which might run
‚Ä≠  The water as they wash‚Äôd.  Then set she near
‚Ä≠  A polish‚Äôd table, on which all the cheer
‚Ä≠  The present could afford a rev‚Äôrend dame,
‚Ä≠  That kept the larder, set.  A cook then came,
‚Ä≠  And divers dishes, borne thence, serv‚Äôd again;
‚Ä≠  Furnish‚Äôd the board with bowls of gold.  And then,
‚Ä≠  His right hand giv‚Äôn the guests, Atrides said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúEat, and be cheerful.  Appetite allay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  I long to ask, of what stock ye descend;
‚Ä≠  For not from parents whose race nameless end
‚Ä≠  We must derive your offspring.  Men obscure
‚Ä≠  Could get none such as you.  The portraiture
‚Ä≠  Of Jove-sustain‚Äôd and sceptre-bearing kings
‚Ä≠  Your either person in his presence brings.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  An ox‚Äôs fat chine then they up did lift,
‚Ä≠  And set before the guests; which was a gift,
‚Ä≠  Sent as an honour to the king‚Äôs own taste.
‚Ä≠  They saw yet ‚Äôtwas but to be eaten plac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And fell to it.  But food and wine‚Äôs care past,
‚Ä≠  Telemachus thus prompted Nestor‚Äôs son,
‚Ä≠  (His ear close laying, to be heard of none):  [3]
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúConsider, thou whom most of my mind esteems,
‚Ä≠  The brass-work here, how rich it is in beams,
‚Ä≠  And how, besides, it makes the whole house sound;
‚Ä≠  What gold, and amber, silver, ivory, round
‚Ä≠  Is wrought about it.  Out of doubt, the hall
‚Ä≠  Of Jupiter Olympius hath of all
‚Ä≠  This state the like.  How many infinites
‚Ä≠  Take up to admiration all men‚Äôs sights!‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Atrides over-heard, and said:  ‚ÄúLov‚Äôd son,
‚Ä≠  No mortal must affect contenti√≥n
‚Ä≠  With Jove, whose dwellings are of endless date.
‚Ä≠  Perhaps of men some one may emulate,
‚Ä≠  Or none, my house, or me; for I am one
‚Ä≠  That many a grave extreme have undergone,
‚Ä≠  Much error felt by sea, and till th‚Äô eighth year,
‚Ä≠  Had never stay, but wander‚Äôd far and near,
‚Ä≠  Cyprus, Ph≈ìnicia, and Sidonia,
‚Ä≠  And fetch‚Äôd the far-off √Üthiopia,
‚Ä≠  Reach‚Äôd the Erembi of Arabia,
‚Ä≠  And Lybia, where with horns ewes yean their lambs,
‚Ä≠  Which ev‚Äôry full year ewes are three times dams,
‚Ä≠  Where neither king, nor shepherd, want comes near
‚Ä≠  Of cheese, or flesh, or sweet milk; all the year
‚Ä≠  They ever milk their ewes.  And here while I
‚Ä≠  Err‚Äôd, gath‚Äôring means to live, one, murd‚Äôrously,
‚Ä≠  Unwares, unseen, bereft my brother‚Äôs life,
‚Ä≠  Chiefly betray‚Äôd by his abhorr√©d wife.
‚Ä≠  So hold I, not enjoying, what you see.
‚Ä≠  And of your fathers, if they living be,
‚Ä≠  You must have heard this, since my suff‚Äôrings were
‚Ä≠  So great and famous; from this palace here
‚Ä≠  (So rarely-well-built, furnish√©d so well,
‚Ä≠  And substanc√©d with such a precious deal
‚Ä≠  Of well-got treasure) banish‚Äôd by the doom
‚Ä≠  Of Fate, and erring as I had no home.
‚Ä≠  And now I have, and use it, not to take
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô entire delight it offers, but to make
‚Ä≠  Continual wishes, that a triple part
‚Ä≠  Of all it holds were wanting, so my heart
‚Ä≠  Were eas‚Äôd of sorrows, taken for their deaths
‚Ä≠  That fell at Troy, by their reviv√©d breaths.
‚Ä≠  And thus sit I here weeping, mourning still
‚Ä≠  Each least man lost; and sometimes make mine ill,
‚Ä≠  In paying just tears for their loss, my joy.
‚Ä≠  Sometimes I breathe my woes, for in annoy
‚Ä≠  The pleasure soon admits satiety.
‚Ä≠  But all these men‚Äôs wants wet not so mine eye,
‚Ä≠  Though much they move me, as one sole man‚Äôs miss,
‚Ä≠  For which my sleep and meat ev‚Äôn loathsome is
‚Ä≠  In his renew‚Äôd thought, since no Greek hath won
‚Ä≠  Grace for such labours as La√´rtes‚Äô son
‚Ä≠  Hath wrought and suffer‚Äôd, to himself nought else
‚Ä≠  But future sorrows forging, to me hells
‚Ä≠  For his long absence, since I cannot know
‚Ä≠  If life or death detain him; since such woe
‚Ä≠  For his love, old La√´rtes, his wise wife,
‚Ä≠  And poor young son sustains, whom new with life
‚Ä≠  He left as sireless.‚Äù  This speech grief to tears
‚Ä≠  (Pour‚Äôd from the son‚Äôs lids on the earth) his ears,
‚Ä≠  Told of the father, did excite; who kept
‚Ä≠  His cheeks dry with his red weed as he wept,
‚Ä≠  His both hands us‚Äôd therein.  Atrides then
‚Ä≠  Began to know him, and did strife retain,
‚Ä≠  If he should let himself confess his sire,
‚Ä≠  Or with all fitting circumstance enquire.
‚Ä≠     While this his thoughts disputed, forth did shine,
‚Ä≠  Like to the golden distaff-deck‚Äôd Divine,
‚Ä≠  From her bed‚Äôs high and odoriferous room,
‚Ä≠  Helen.  To whom, of an elaborate loom,
‚Ä≠  Adresta set a chair; Alcippe brought
‚Ä≠  A piece of tapestry of fine wool wrought;
‚Ä≠  Phylo a silver cabinet conferr‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Giv‚Äôn by Alcandra, nuptially endear‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To lord Polybius, whose abode in Thebes
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô √Ügyptian city was, where wealth in heaps
‚Ä≠  His famous house held, out of which did go,
‚Ä≠  In gift t‚Äô Atrides, silver bath-tubs two,
‚Ä≠  Two tripods, and of fine gold talents ten.
‚Ä≠  His wife did likewise send to Helen then
‚Ä≠  Fair gifts, a distaff that of gold was wrought,
‚Ä≠  And that rich cabinet that Phylo brought,
‚Ä≠  Round, and with gold ribb‚Äôd, now of fine thread full;
‚Ä≠  On which extended (crown‚Äòd with finest wool,
‚Ä≠  Of violet gloss) the golden distaff-lay.
‚Ä≠     She took her state-chair, and a foot-stool‚Äôs stay
‚Ä≠  Had for her feet; and of her husband thus
‚Ä≠  Ask‚Äôd to know all things:  ‚ÄúIs it known to us,
‚Ä≠  King Menelaus, whom these men commend
‚Ä≠  Themselves for, that our court now takes to friend?
‚Ä≠  I must affirm, be I deceiv‚Äôd or no,
‚Ä≠  I never yet saw man nor woman so
‚Ä≠  Like one another, as this man is like
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô son.  With admiration strike
‚Ä≠  His looks my thoughts, that they should carry now
‚Ä≠  Pow‚Äôr to persuade me thus, who did but know,
‚Ä≠  When newly he was born, the form they bore.
‚Ä≠  But ‚Äôtis his father‚Äôs grace, whom more and more
‚Ä≠  His grace resembles, that makes me retain
‚Ä≠  Thought that he now is like Telemachus, then
‚Ä≠  Left by his sire, when Greece did undertake
‚Ä≠  Troy‚Äôs bold war for my impudency‚Äôs sake.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúNow wife, what you think I know,
‚Ä≠  The true cast of his father‚Äôs eye doth show
‚Ä≠  In his eyes‚Äô order.  Both his head and hair,
‚Ä≠  His hands and feet, his very father‚Äôs are.
‚Ä≠  Of whom, so well remember‚Äôd, I should now
‚Ä≠  Acknowledge for me his continual flow
‚Ä≠  Of cares and perils, yet still patient.
‚Ä≠  But I should too much move him, that doth vent
‚Ä≠  Such bitter tears for that which hath been spoke,
‚Ä≠  Which, shunning soft show, see how he would cloak,
‚Ä≠  And with his purple weed his weepings hide.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Then Nestor‚Äôs son, Pisistratus, replied:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúGreat pastor of the people, kept of God!
‚Ä≠  He is Ulysses‚Äô son, but his abode
‚Ä≠  Not made before here, and he modest too,
‚Ä≠  He holds it an indignity to do
‚Ä≠  A deed so vain, to use the boast of words,
‚Ä≠  Where your words are on wing; whose voice affords
‚Ä≠  Delight to us as if a God did break
‚Ä≠  The air amongst us, and vouchsafe to speak.
‚Ä≠  But me my father, old duke Nestor, sent
‚Ä≠  To be his consort hither; his content
‚Ä≠  Not to be heighten‚Äôd so as with your sight,
‚Ä≠  In hope that therewith words and actions might
‚Ä≠  Inform his comforts from you, since he is
‚Ä≠  Extremely griev‚Äôd and injur‚Äôd by the miss
‚Ä≠  Of his great father; suff‚Äôring ev‚Äôn at home,
‚Ä≠  And few friends found to help him overcome
‚Ä≠  His too weak suff‚Äôrance, now his sire is gone;
‚Ä≠  Amongst the people, not afforded one
‚Ä≠  To check the miseries that mate him thus.
‚Ä≠  And this the state is of Telemachus.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO Gods,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúhow certain, now, I see
‚Ä≠  My house enjoys that friend‚Äôs son, that for me
‚Ä≠  Hath undergone so many willing fights!
‚Ä≠  Whom I resolv‚Äôd, past all the Grecian knights,
‚Ä≠  To hold in love, if our return by seas
‚Ä≠  The far-off Thunderer did ever please
‚Ä≠  To grant our wishes.  And to his respect
‚Ä≠  A palace and a city to erect,
‚Ä≠  My vow had bound me; whither bringing then
‚Ä≠  His riches, and his son, and all his men,
‚Ä≠  From barren Ithaca, (some one sole town
‚Ä≠  Inhabited about him batter‚Äôd down)
‚Ä≠  All should in Argos live.  And there would I
‚Ä≠  Ease him of rule, and take the empery
‚Ä≠  Of all on me.  And often here would we,
‚Ä≠  Delighting, loving either‚Äôs company,
‚Ä≠  Meet and converse; whom nothing should divide,
‚Ä≠  Till death‚Äôs black veil did each all over hide.
‚Ä≠  But this perhaps hath been a mean to take
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn God himself with envy; who did make
‚Ä≠  Ulysses therefore only the unblest,
‚Ä≠  That should not reach his loved country‚Äôs rest.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     These woes made ev‚Äôry one with woe in love;
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn Argive Helen wept, the Seed of Jove;
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô son wept; Atreus‚Äô son did weep;
‚Ä≠  And Nestor‚Äôs son his eyes in tears did steep,
‚Ä≠  But his tears fell not from the present cloud
‚Ä≠  That from Ulysses was exhal‚Äôd, but flow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  From brave Antilochus‚Äô remember‚Äôd due,
‚Ä≠  Whom the renown‚Äôd Son of the Morning slew,
‚Ä≠  Which yet he thus excus‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúO Atreus‚Äô son!
‚Ä≠  Old Nestor says, there lives not such a one
‚Ä≠  Amongst all mortals as Atrides is
‚Ä≠  For deathless wisdom.  ‚ÄôTis a praise of his,
‚Ä≠  Still giv‚Äôn in your remembrance, when at home
‚Ä≠  Our speech concerns you.  Since then overcome
‚Ä≠  You please to be with sorrow, ev‚Äôn to tears,
‚Ä≠  That are in wisdom so exempt from peers,
‚Ä≠  Vouchsafe the like effect in me excuse,
‚Ä≠  If it be lawful, I affect no use
‚Ä≠  Of tears thus after meals; at least, at night;
‚Ä≠  But when the morn brings forth, with tears, her light,
‚Ä≠  It shall not then impair me to bestow
‚Ä≠  My tears on any worthy‚Äôs overthrow.
‚Ä≠  It is the only rite that wretched men
‚Ä≠  Can do dead friends, to cut hair, and complain.
‚Ä≠  But Death my brother took, whom none could call
‚Ä≠  The Grecian coward, you best knew of all.
‚Ä≠  I was not there, nor saw, but men report
‚Ä≠  Antilochus excell‚Äôd the common sort
‚Ä≠  For footmanship, or for the chariot race,
‚Ä≠  Or in the fight for hardy hold of place.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO friend,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúsince thou hast spoken so,
‚Ä≠  At all parts as one wise should say and do,
‚Ä≠  And like one far beyond thyself in years,
‚Ä≠  Thy words shall bounds be to our former tears.
‚Ä≠  O he is questionless a right-born son,
‚Ä≠  That of his father hath not only won
‚Ä≠  The person but the wisdom; and that sire
‚Ä≠  Complete himself that hath a son entire,
‚Ä≠  Jove did not only his full fate adorn,
‚Ä≠  When he was wedded, but when he was born.
‚Ä≠  As now Saturnius, through his life‚Äôs whole date,
‚Ä≠  Hath Nestor‚Äôs bliss rais‚Äôd to as steep a state,
‚Ä≠  Both in his age to keep in peace his house,
‚Ä≠  And to have children wise and valorous.
‚Ä≠  But let us not forget our rear feast thus.
‚Ä≠  Let some give water here.  Telemachus!
‚Ä≠  The morning shall yield time to you and me
‚Ä≠  To do what fits, and reason mutually.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, the careful servant of the king,
‚Ä≠  Asphalion, pour‚Äôd on th‚Äô issue of the spring;
‚Ä≠  And all to ready feast set ready hand.
‚Ä≠  But Helen now on new device did stand,
‚Ä≠  Infusing straight a medicine to their wine,
‚Ä≠  That, drowning care and angers; did decline
‚Ä≠  All thought of ill.  Who drunk her cup could shed
‚Ä≠  All that day not a tear, no not if dead
‚Ä≠  That day his father or his mother were,
‚Ä≠  Not if his brother, child, or chiefest dear,
‚Ä≠  He should see murder‚Äôd then before his face.
‚Ä≠  Such useful medicines, only borne in grace
‚Ä≠  Of what was good, would Helen ever have.
‚Ä≠  And this juice to her Polydamna gave
‚Ä≠  The wife of Thoon, an √Ügyptian born,
‚Ä≠  Whose rich earth herbs of medicine do adorn
‚Ä≠  In great abundance.  Many healthful are,
‚Ä≠  And many baneful.  Ev‚Äôry man is there
‚Ä≠  A good physician out of Nature‚Äôs grace,
‚Ä≠  For all the nation sprung of P√¶on‚Äôs race.
‚Ä≠     When Helen then her medicine had infus‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  She bad pour wine to it, and this speech us‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAtrides, and these good men‚Äôs sons, great Jove
‚Ä≠  Makes good and ill one after other move,
‚Ä≠  In all things earthly; for he can do all.
‚Ä≠  The woes past, therefore, he so late let fall,
‚Ä≠  The comforts he affords us let us take;
‚Ä≠  Feast, and, with fit discourses, merry make.
‚Ä≠  Nor will I other use.  As then our blood
‚Ä≠  Griev‚Äôd for Ulysses, since he was so good,
‚Ä≠  Since he was good, let us delight to hear
‚Ä≠  How good he was, and what his suff‚Äôrings were;
‚Ä≠  Though ev‚Äôry fight, and ev‚Äôry suff‚Äôring deed,
‚Ä≠  Patient Ulysses underwent, exceed
‚Ä≠  My woman‚Äôs pow‚Äôr to number, or to name.
‚Ä≠  But what he did, and suffer‚Äôd, when he came
‚Ä≠  Amongst the Trojans, where ye Grecians all
‚Ä≠  Took part with suff‚Äôrance, I in part can call
‚Ä≠  To your kind memories.  How with ghastly wounds
‚Ä≠  Himself he mangled, and the Trojan bounds,
‚Ä≠  Thrust thick with enemies, adventur‚Äôd on,
‚Ä≠  His royal shoulders having cast upon
‚Ä≠  Base abject weeds, and enter‚Äôd like a slave.
‚Ä≠  Then, beggar-like, he did of all men crave,
‚Ä≠  And such a wretch was, as the whole Greek fleet
‚Ä≠  Brought not besides.  And thus through ev‚Äôry street
‚Ä≠  He crept discov‚Äôring, of no one man known.
‚Ä≠  And yet through all this diff‚Äôrence, I alone
‚Ä≠  Smoked his true person, talk‚Äôd with him; but he
‚Ä≠  Fled me with wiles still.  Nor could we agree,
‚Ä≠  Till I disclaim‚Äôd him quite; and so (as mov‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With womanly remorse of one that prov‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  So wretched an estate, whate‚Äôer he were)
‚Ä≠  Won him to take my house.  And yet ev‚Äôn there,
‚Ä≠  Till freely I, to make him doubtless, swore
‚Ä≠  A pow‚Äôrful oath, to let him reach the shore
‚Ä≠  Of ships and tents before Troy understood,
‚Ä≠  I could not force on him his proper good.
‚Ä≠  But then I bath‚Äôd and sooth‚Äôd him, and he then
‚Ä≠  Confess‚Äôd, and told me all; and, having slain
‚Ä≠  A number of the Trojan guards, retir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And reach‚Äôd the fleet, for sleight and force admir‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Their husbands‚Äô deaths by him the Trojan wives
‚Ä≠  Shriek‚Äôd for; but I made triumphs for their lives,
‚Ä≠  For then my heart conceiv‚Äôd, that once again
‚Ä≠  I should reach home; and yet did still retain
‚Ä≠  Woe for the slaughters Venus made for me,
‚Ä≠  When both my husband, my Hermione,
‚Ä≠  And bridal room, she robb‚Äôd of so much right,
‚Ä≠  And drew me from my country with her sleight,
‚Ä≠  Though nothing under heaven I here did need,
‚Ä≠  That could my fancy or my beauty feed.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Her husband said:  ‚ÄúWife!  what you please to tell
‚Ä≠  Is true at all parts, and becomes you well;
‚Ä≠  And I myself, that now may say have seen
‚Ä≠  The minds and manners of a world of men,
‚Ä≠  And great heroes, measuring many a ground,
‚Ä≠  Have never, by these eyes that light me, found
‚Ä≠  One with a bosom so to be belov‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  As that in which th‚Äô accomplish‚Äôd spirit mov‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of patient Ulysses.  What, brave man,
‚Ä≠  He both did act, and suffer, when he wan
‚Ä≠  The town of Ilion, in the brave-built horse,
‚Ä≠  When all we chief states of the Grecian force
‚Ä≠  Were hous‚Äôd together, bringing death and Fate
‚Ä≠  Amongst the Trojans, you, wife, may relate;
‚Ä≠  For you, at last, came to us; God, that would
‚Ä≠  The Trojans‚Äô glory give, gave charge you should
‚Ä≠  Approach the engine; and Deiphobus,
‚Ä≠  The god-like, follow‚Äôd.  Thrice ye circled us
‚Ä≠  With full survey of it; and often tried
‚Ä≠  The hollow crafts that in it were implied.  [4]
‚Ä≠  When all the voices of their wives in it
‚Ä≠  You took on you with voice so like and fit,
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôry man by name so visited,
‚Ä≠  That I, Ulysses, the king Diomed,
‚Ä≠  (Set in the midst, and hearing how you call‚Äôd)
‚Ä≠  Tydides, and myself (as half appall‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With your remorseful plaints) would passing fain
‚Ä≠  Have broke our silence, rather than again
‚Ä≠  Endure, respectless, their so moving cries.
‚Ä≠  But Ithacus our strongest phantasies
‚Ä≠  Contain‚Äôd within us from the slenderest noise,
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôry man there sat without a voice.
‚Ä≠  Anticlus only would have answer‚Äôd thee,
‚Ä≠  But his speech Ithacus incessantly
‚Ä≠  With strong hand held in, till, Minerva‚Äôs call
‚Ä≠  Charging thee off, Ulysses sav‚Äôd us all.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Telemachus replied:  ‚ÄúMuch greater is
‚Ä≠  My grief, for hearing this high praise of his.
‚Ä≠  For all this doth not his sad death divert,
‚Ä≠  Nor can, though in him swell‚Äôd an iron heart.
‚Ä≠  Prepare, and lead then, if you please, to rest:
‚Ä≠  Sleep, that we hear not, will content us best.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Then Argive Helen made her handmaid go,
‚Ä≠  And put fair bedding in the portico,
‚Ä≠  Lay purple blankets on, rugs warm and soft,
‚Ä≠  And cast an arras coverlet aloft.
‚Ä≠     They torches took, made haste, and made the bed;
‚Ä≠  When both the guests were to their lodgings led
‚Ä≠  Within a portico without the house.
‚Ä≠  Atrides, and his large-train-wearing spouse,
‚Ä≠  The excellent of women, for the way,
‚Ä≠  In a retir‚Äôd receit, together lay.
‚Ä≠  The Morn arose; the king rose, and put on
‚Ä≠  His royal weeds, his sharp sword hung upon
‚Ä≠  His ample shoulders, forth his chamber went,
‚Ä≠  And did the person of a God present.
‚Ä≠     Telemachus accosts him, who begun
‚Ä≠  Speech of his journey‚Äôs proposition:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAnd what, my young Ulyssean hero√´,
‚Ä≠  Provok‚Äôd thee on the broad back of the sea,
‚Ä≠  To visit Laced√¶mon the divine?
‚Ä≠  Speak truth, some public [good] or only thine?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI come,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúto hear, if any fame
‚Ä≠  Breath‚Äôd of my father to thy notice came.
‚Ä≠  My house is sack‚Äôd, my fat works of the field
‚Ä≠  Are all destroy‚Äôd; my house doth nothing yield
‚Ä≠  But enemies, that kill my harmless sheep,
‚Ä≠  And sinewy oxen, nor will ever keep
‚Ä≠  Their steels without them.  And these men are they
‚Ä≠  That woo my mother, most inhumanly
‚Ä≠  Committing injury on injury.
‚Ä≠  To thy knees therefore I am come, t‚Äô attend
‚Ä≠  Relation of the sad and wretched end
‚Ä≠  My erring father felt, if witness‚Äôd by
‚Ä≠  Your own eyes, or the certain news that fly
‚Ä≠  From others‚Äô knowledges.  For, more than is
‚Ä≠  The usual heap of human miseries,
‚Ä≠  His mother bore him to.  Vouchsafe me then,
‚Ä≠  Without all ruth of what I can sustain,
‚Ä≠  The plain and simple truth of all you know.
‚Ä≠  Let me beseech so much, if ever vow
‚Ä≠  Was made, and put in good effect to you,
‚Ä≠  At Troy, where suff‚Äôrance bred you so much smart,
‚Ä≠  Upon my father good Ulysses‚Äô part,
‚Ä≠  And quit it now to me (himself in youth)
‚Ä≠  Unfolding only the unclos√©d truth.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He, deeply sighing, answer‚Äôd him:  ‚ÄúO shame,
‚Ä≠  That such poor vassals should affect the fame
‚Ä≠  To share the joys of such a worthy‚Äôs bed!
‚Ä≠  As when a hind, her calves late farrow√©d,
‚Ä≠  To give suck, enters the bold lion‚Äôs den,
‚Ä≠  He roots of hills and herby vallies then
‚Ä≠  For food (there feeding) hunting; but at length
‚Ä≠  Returning to his cavern, gives his strength
‚Ä≠  The lives of both the mother and her brood
‚Ä≠  In deaths indecent; so the Wooers‚Äô blood
‚Ä≠  Must pay Ulysses‚Äô pow‚Äôrs as sharp an end.
‚Ä≠  O would to Jove, Apollo, and thy friend
‚Ä≠  The wise Minerva, that thy father were
‚Ä≠  As once he was, when he his spirits did rear
‚Ä≠  Against Philomelides, in a fight
‚Ä≠  Perform‚Äôd in well-built Lesbos, where, down-right
‚Ä≠  He strook the earth with him, and gat a shout
‚Ä≠  Of all the Grecians!  O, if now full out
‚Ä≠  He were as then, and with the Wooers coped,
‚Ä≠  Short-liv‚Äôd they all were, and their nuptials hoped
‚Ä≠  Would prove as desp‚Äôrate.  But, for thy demand
‚Ä≠  Enforc‚Äôd with pray‚Äôrs, I‚Äôll let thee understand
‚Ä≠  The truth directly, nor decline a thought,
‚Ä≠  Much less deceive, or sooth thy search in ought;
‚Ä≠  But what the old and still-true-spoken God,
‚Ä≠  That from the sea breathes oracles abroad,
‚Ä≠  Disclos‚Äôd to me, to thee I‚Äôll all impart,
‚Ä≠  Nor hide one word from thy sollicitous heart.
‚Ä≠      I was in √Ügypt, where a mighty time
‚Ä≠  The Gods detain‚Äôd me, though my natural clime
‚Ä≠  I never so desir‚Äôd, because their homes
‚Ä≠  I did not greet with perfect hecatombs.
‚Ä≠  For they will put men evermore in mind,
‚Ä≠  How much their masterly commandments bind.
‚Ä≠     There is, besides, a certain island, call‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Pharos, that with the high-wav‚Äôd sea is wall‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Just against √Ügypt, and so much remote,
‚Ä≠  As in a whole day, with a fore-gale smote,
‚Ä≠  A hollow ship can sail.  And this isle bears
‚Ä≠  A port most portly, where sea-passengers
‚Ä≠  Put in still for fresh water, and away
‚Ä≠  To sea again.  Yet here the Gods did stay
‚Ä≠  My fleet full twenty days; the winds, that are
‚Ä≠  Masters at sea, no prosp‚Äôrous puff would spare
‚Ä≠  To put us off; and all my victuals here
‚Ä≠  Had quite corrupted, as my men‚Äôs minds were,
‚Ä≠  Had not a certain Goddess giv‚Äôn regard,
‚Ä≠  And pitied me in an estate so hard;
‚Ä≠  And ‚Äôtwas Idothea, honour‚Äôd Proteus‚Äô seed,
‚Ä≠  That old sea-farer.  Her mind I make bleed
‚Ä≠  With my compassion, when (walk‚Äôd all alone,
‚Ä≠  From all my soldiers, that were ever gone
‚Ä≠  About the isle on fishing with hooks bent;
‚Ä≠  Hunger their bellies on her errand sent)
‚Ä≠  She came close to me, spake, and thus began:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄòOf all men thou art the most foolish man!
‚Ä≠  Or slack in business, or stay‚Äôst here of choice,
‚Ä≠  And dost in all thy suff‚Äôrances rejoice,
‚Ä≠  That thus long liv‚Äôst detain‚Äôd here, and no end
‚Ä≠  Canst give thy tarriance?  Thou dost much offend
‚Ä≠  The minds of all thy fellows.‚Äô  I replied:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄòWhoever thou art of the Deified,
‚Ä≠  I must affirm, that no way with my will
‚Ä≠  I make abode here; but, it seems, some ill
‚Ä≠  The Gods, inhabiting broad heav‚Äôn, sustain
‚Ä≠  Against my getting off.  Inform me then,
‚Ä≠  For Godheads all things know, what God is he
‚Ä≠  That stays my passage from the fishy sea?‚Äô
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄòStranger,‚Äô said she, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll tell thee true: There lives
‚Ä≠  An old sea-farer in these seas, that gives
‚Ä≠  A true solution of all secrets here,
‚Ä≠  Who deathless Proteus is, th‚Äô √Ügyptian peer,
‚Ä≠  Who can the deeps of all the seas exquire,
‚Ä≠  Who Neptune‚Äôs priest is, and, they say, the sire
‚Ä≠  That did beget me.  Him, if any way
‚Ä≠  Thou couldst inveigle, he would clear display
‚Ä≠  Thy course from hence, and how far off doth lie
‚Ä≠  Thy voyage‚Äôs whole scope through Neptune‚Äôs sky.
‚Ä≠  Informing thee, O God-preserv‚Äôd, beside,
‚Ä≠  If thy desires would so be satisfied,
‚Ä≠  Whatever good or ill hath got event,
‚Ä≠  In all the time thy long and hard course spent,
‚Ä≠  Since thy departure from thy house.‚Äô  This said;
‚Ä≠  Again I answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄòMake the sleights display‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Thy father useth, lest his foresight see,
‚Ä≠  Or his foreknowledge taking note of me,
‚Ä≠  He flies the fixt place of his us‚Äôd abode.
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTis hard for man to countermine with God.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     She straight replied: ‚ÄòI‚Äôll utter truth in all:
‚Ä≠  When heav‚Äôn‚Äôs supremest height the sun doth skall,
‚Ä≠  The old Sea-tell-truth leaves the deeps, and hides
‚Ä≠  Amidst a black storm, when the West Wind chides,
‚Ä≠  In caves still sleeping.  Round about him sleep
‚Ä≠  (With short feet swimming forth the foamy deep)
‚Ä≠  The sea-calves, lovely Halosydnes call‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  From whom a noisome odour is exhal‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Got from the whirl-pools, on whose earth they lie.
‚Ä≠  Here, when the morn illustrates all the sky,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll guide, and seat thee in the fittest place
‚Ä≠  For the performance thou hast now in chace.
‚Ä≠  In mean time, reach thy fleet, and choose out three
‚Ä≠  Of best exploit, to go as aids to thee.
‚Ä≠     But now I‚Äôll show thee all the old God‚Äôs sleights:
‚Ä≠  He first will number, and take all the sights
‚Ä≠  Of those his guard, that on the shore arrives.
‚Ä≠  When having view‚Äôd, and told them forth by fives,
‚Ä≠  He takes place in their midst, and there doth sleep,
‚Ä≠  Like to a shepherd midst his flock of sheep.
‚Ä≠  In his first sleep, call up your hardiest cheer,
‚Ä≠  Vigour and violence, and hold him there,
‚Ä≠  In spite of all his strivings to be gone.
‚Ä≠  He then will turn himself to ev‚Äôry one
‚Ä≠  Of all things that in earth creep and respire,
‚Ä≠  In water swim, or shine in heav‚Äônly fire.
‚Ä≠  Yet still hold you him firm, and much the more
‚Ä≠  Press him from passing.  But when, as before,
‚Ä≠  When sleep first bound his pow‚Äôrs, his form ye see,
‚Ä≠  Then cease your force, and th‚Äô old hero√´ free,
‚Ä≠  And then demand, which heav‚Äôn-born it may be
‚Ä≠  That so afflicts you, hind‚Äôring your retreat,
‚Ä≠  And free sea-passage to your native seat.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This said, she div‚Äôd into the wavy seas,
‚Ä≠  And I my course did to my ships address,
‚Ä≠  That on the sands stuck; where arriv‚Äôd, we made
‚Ä≠  Our supper ready.  Then th‚Äô ambrosian shade
‚Ä≠  Of night fell on us, and to sleep we fell.
‚Ä≠  Rosy Aurora rose; we rose as well,
‚Ä≠  And three of them on whom I most relied,
‚Ä≠  For firm at ev‚Äôry force, I choos‚Äôd, and hied
‚Ä≠  Straight to the many-river-serv√©d seas;
‚Ä≠  And all assistance ask‚Äôd the Deities.
‚Ä≠     Mean time Idothea the sea‚Äôs broad breast
‚Ä≠  Embrac‚Äôd, and brought for me, and all my rest,
‚Ä≠  Four of the sea-calves‚Äô skins but newly flay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  To work a wile which she had fashion√©d
‚Ä≠  Upon her father.  Then, within the sand
‚Ä≠  A covert digging, when these calves should land,
‚Ä≠  She sat expecting.  We came close to her;
‚Ä≠  She plac‚Äôd us orderly, and made us wear
‚Ä≠  Each one his calf‚Äôs skin.  But we then must pass
‚Ä≠  A huge exploit.  The sea-calves‚Äô savour was
‚Ä≠  So passing sour, they still being bred at seas,
‚Ä≠  It much afflicted us; for who can please
‚Ä≠  To lie by one of these same sea-bred whales?
‚Ä≠  But she preserves us, and to memory calls
‚Ä≠  A rare commodity; she fetch‚Äôd to us
‚Ä≠  Ambrosia, that an air most odorous
‚Ä≠  Bears still about it, which she ‚Äònointed round
‚Ä≠  Our either nosthrils, and in it quite drown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The nasty whale-smell.  Then the great event
‚Ä≠  The whole morn‚Äôs date, with spirits patient,
‚Ä≠  We lay expecting.  When bright noon did flame,
‚Ä≠  Forth from the sea in shoals the sea-calves came,
‚Ä≠  And orderly, at last lay down and slept
‚Ä≠  Along the sands.  And then th‚Äô old Sea-God crept
‚Ä≠  From forth the deeps, and found his fat calves there,
‚Ä≠  Survey‚Äôd, and number‚Äôd, and came never near
‚Ä≠  The craft we us‚Äôd, but told us five for calves.
‚Ä≠  His temples then dis-eas‚Äôd with sleep he salves;
‚Ä≠  And in rush‚Äôd we, with an abhorr√©d cry,
‚Ä≠  Cast all our hands about him manfully;
‚Ä≠  And then th‚Äô old Forger all his forms began:
‚Ä≠  First was a lion with a mighty mane,
‚Ä≠  Then next a dragon, a pied panther then,
‚Ä≠  A vast boar next, and suddenly did strain
‚Ä≠  All into water.  Last he was a tree,
‚Ä≠  Curl‚Äôd all at top, and shot up to the sky.
‚Ä≠     We, with resolv‚Äôd hearts, held him firmly still,
‚Ä≠  When th‚Äô old one (held too strait for all his skill
‚Ä≠  To extricate) gave words, and question‚Äôd me:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúWhich of the Gods, O Atreus‚Äô son,‚Äô said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòAdvis‚Äôd and taught thy fortitude this sleight,
‚Ä≠  To take and hold me thus in my despite?‚Äô
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòWhat asks thy wish now?‚Äô I replied.  'Thou know‚Äôst.
‚Ä≠  Why dost thou ask?  What wiles are these thou show‚Äôst?
‚Ä≠  I have within this isle been held for wind
‚Ä≠  A wondrous time, and can by no means find
‚Ä≠  An end to my retention.  It hath spent
‚Ä≠  The very heart in me.  Give thou then vent
‚Ä≠  To doubts thus bound in me, ye Gods know all,
‚Ä≠  Which of the Godheads doth so foully fall
‚Ä≠  On my addression home, to stay me here,
‚Ä≠  Avert me from my way, the fishy clear
‚Ä≠  Barr‚Äôd to my passage?‚Äô  He replied:  ‚ÄòOf force,
‚Ä≠  If to thy home thou wishest free recourse,
‚Ä≠  To Jove, and all the other Deities,
‚Ä≠  Thou must exhibit solemn sacrifice;
‚Ä≠  And then the black sea for thee shall be clear,
‚Ä≠  Till thy lov‚Äôd country‚Äôs settled reach.  But where
‚Ä≠  Ask these rites thy performance?  ‚ÄôTis a fate
‚Ä≠  To thee and thy affairs appropriate,
‚Ä≠  That thou shalt never see thy friends, nor tread
‚Ä≠  Thy country‚Äôs earth, nor see inhabited
‚Ä≠  Thy so magnificent house, till thou make good
‚Ä≠  Thy voyage back to the √Ügyptian flood,
‚Ä≠  Whose waters fell from Jove, and there hast giv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  To Jove, and all Gods housed in ample heav‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  Devoted hecatombs, and then free ways
‚Ä≠  Shall open to thee, clear‚Äôd of all delays.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This told he; and, methought, he brake my heart,
‚Ä≠  In such a long and hard course to divert
‚Ä≠  My hope for home, and charge my back retreat
‚Ä≠  As far as √Ügypt.  I made answer yet:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄòFather, thy charge I‚Äôll perfect; but before
‚Ä≠  Resolve me truly, if their natural shore
‚Ä≠  All those Greeks, and their ships, do safe enjoy,
‚Ä≠  That Nestor and myself left, when from Troy
‚Ä≠  We first rais‚Äôd sail?  Or whether any died
‚Ä≠  At sea a death unwish‚Äôd?  Or, satisfied,
‚Ä≠  When war was past, by friends embrac‚Äôd, in peace
‚Ä≠  Resign‚Äôd their spirits?  He made answer: ‚ÄòCease
‚Ä≠  To ask so far.  It fits thee not to be
‚Ä≠  So cunning in thine own calamity.
‚Ä≠  Nor seek to learn what learn‚Äôd thou shouldst forget.
‚Ä≠  Men‚Äôs knowledges have proper limits set,
‚Ä≠  And should not prease into the mind of God.
‚Ä≠  But ‚Äôtwill not long be, as my thoughts abode,
‚Ä≠  Before thou buy this curious skill with tears.
‚Ä≠  Many of those, whose states so tempt thine ears,
‚Ä≠  Are stoop‚Äôd by death, and many left alive,
‚Ä≠  One chief of which in strong hold doth survive,
‚Ä≠  Amidst the broad sea.  Two, in their retreat,
‚Ä≠  Are done to death.  I list not to repeat
‚Ä≠  Who fell at Troy, thyself was there in fight,
‚Ä≠  But in return swift Ajax lost the light,
‚Ä≠  In his long-oar‚Äôd ship.  Neptune, yet, awhile
‚Ä≠  Saft him unwrack‚Äôd, to the Gyr√¶an isle,
‚Ä≠  A mighty-rock removing from his way.
‚Ä≠  And surely he had ‚Äòscap‚Äôd the fatal day,
‚Ä≠  In spite of Pallas, if to that foul deed
‚Ä≠  He in her fane did, (when he ravish√©d
‚Ä≠  The Trojan prophetess) he had not here
‚Ä≠  Adjoin‚Äôd an impious boast, that he would bear,
‚Ä≠  Despite the Gods, his ship safe through the waves
‚Ä≠  Then rais‚Äôd against him.  These his impious braves
‚Ä≠  When Neptune heard, in his strong hand he took
‚Ä≠  His massy trident, and so soundly strook
‚Ä≠  The rock Gyr√¶an, that in two it cleft;
‚Ä≠  Of which one fragment on the land he left,
‚Ä≠  The other fell into the troubled seas;
‚Ä≠  At which first rush‚Äôd Ajax O√Øliades,
‚Ä≠  And split his ship, and then himself afloat
‚Ä≠  Swum on the rough waves of the world‚Äôs vast mote,
‚Ä≠  Till having drunk a salt cup for his sin,
‚Ä≠  There perish‚Äôd he.  Thy brother yet did win
‚Ä≠  The wreath from death, while in the waves they strove,
‚Ä≠  Afflicted by the rev‚Äôrend wife of Jove.
‚Ä≠  But when the steep mount of the Malian shore
‚Ä≠  He seem‚Äôd to reach, a most tempestuous blore,
‚Ä≠  Far to the fishy world that sighs so sore,
‚Ä≠  Straight ravish‚Äôd him again as far away,
‚Ä≠  As to th‚Äô extreme bounds where the Agrians stay,
‚Ä≠  Where first Thyestes dwelt, but then his son
‚Ä≠  √Ügisthus Thyestiades liv‚Äôd.  This done,
‚Ä≠  When his return untouch‚Äôd appear‚Äôd again,
‚Ä≠  Back turn‚Äôd the Gods the wind, and set him then
‚Ä≠  Hard by his house.  Then, full of joy, he left
‚Ä≠  His ship, and close t‚Äô his country earth he cleft,
‚Ä≠  Kiss‚Äôd it, and wept for joy, pour‚Äôd tear on tear,
‚Ä≠  To set so wishedly his footing there.
‚Ä≠  But see, a sentinel that all the year
‚Ä≠  Crafty √Ügisthus in a watchtow‚Äôr set
‚Ä≠  To spy his landing, for reward as great
‚Ä≠  As two gold talents, all his pow‚Äôrs did call
‚Ä≠  To strict remembrance of his charge, and all
‚Ä≠  Discharg‚Äôd at first sight, which at first he cast
‚Ä≠  On Agamemnon, and with all his haste
‚Ä≠  Inform‚Äôd √Ügisthus.  He an instant train
‚Ä≠  Laid for his slaughter: Twenty chosen men
‚Ä≠  Of his plebeians he in ambush laid;
‚Ä≠  His other men he charg‚Äôd to see purvey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A feast; and forth, with horse and chariots grac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  He rode t‚Äô invite him, but in heart embrac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Horrible welcomes, and to death did bring,
‚Ä≠  With treach‚Äôrous slaughter, the unwary king,
‚Ä≠  Receiv‚Äôd him at a feast, and, like an ox
‚Ä≠  Slain at his manger, gave him bits and knocks.
‚Ä≠  No one left of Atrides‚Äô train, nor one
‚Ä≠  Sav‚Äôd to √Ügisthus, but himself alone,
‚Ä≠  All strew‚Äôd together there the bloody court.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  This said, my soul he sunk with his report,
‚Ä≠  Flat on the sands I fell, tears spent their store,
‚Ä≠  I light abhorr‚Äôd, my heart would live no more.
‚Ä≠     When dry of tears, and tir‚Äôd of tumbling there,
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô old Tell-truth thus my daunted spirits did cheer:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄòNo more spend tears nor time, O Atreus‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  With ceaseless weeping never wish was won,
‚Ä≠  Use uttermost assay to reach thy home,
‚Ä≠  And all unwares upon the murderer come,
‚Ä≠  For torture, taking him thyself alive;
‚Ä≠  Or let Orestes, that should far out-strive
‚Ä≠  Thee in fit vengeance, quickly quit the light
‚Ä≠  Of such a dark soul, and do thou the rite
‚Ä≠  Of burial to him with a funeral feast.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     With these last words I fortified my breast,
‚Ä≠  In which again a gen‚Äôrous spring began
‚Ä≠  Of fitting comfort, as I was a man;
‚Ä≠  But, as a brother, I must ever mourn.
‚Ä≠  Yet forth I went, and told him the return
‚Ä≠  Of these I knew; but he had nam‚Äôd a third,
‚Ä≠  Held on the broad sea, still with life inspir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Whom I besought to know, though likewise dead,
‚Ä≠  And I must mourn alike.  He answer√©d:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄòHe is Laertes‚Äô son; whom I beheld
‚Ä≠  In nymph Calypso‚Äôs palace, who compell‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His stay with her, and, since he could not see
‚Ä≠  His country earth, he mourn‚Äôd incessantly.
‚Ä≠  For he had neither ship instruct with oars,
‚Ä≠  Nor men to fetch him from those stranger shores.
‚Ä≠  Where leave we him, and to thy self descend,
‚Ä≠  Whom not in Argos Fate nor Death shall end,
‚Ä≠  But the immortal ends of all the earth,
‚Ä≠  So rul‚Äôd by them that order death by birth,
‚Ä≠  The fields Elysian, Fate to thee will give;
‚Ä≠  Where Rhadamanthus rules, and where men live
‚Ä≠  A never-troubled life, where snow, nor show‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  Nor irksome Winter spends his fruitless pow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  But from the ocean Zephyr still resumes
‚Ä≠  A constant breath, that all the fields perfumes.
‚Ä≠  Which, since thou marriedst Helen, are thy hire,
‚Ä≠  And Jove himself is by her side thy sire.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This said; he div‚Äôd the deepsome wat‚Äôry heaps;
‚Ä≠  I and my tried men took us to our ships,
‚Ä≠  And worlds of thoughts I varied with my steps.
‚Ä≠     Arriv‚Äôd and shipp‚Äôd, the silent solemn night
‚Ä≠  And sleep bereft us of our visual light.
‚Ä≠  At morn, masts, sails, rear‚Äôd, we sat, left the shores,
‚Ä≠  And beat the foamy ocean with our oars.
‚Ä≠     Again then we the Jove-fall‚Äôn flood did fetch,
‚Ä≠  As far as √Ügypt; where we did beseech
‚Ä≠  The Gods with hecatombs; whose angers ceast,
‚Ä≠  I tomb‚Äôd my brother that I might be blest.
‚Ä≠     All rites perform‚Äôd, all haste I made for home,
‚Ä≠  And all the prosp‚Äôrous winds about were come,
‚Ä≠  I had the passport now of ev‚Äôry God,
‚Ä≠  And here clos‚Äôd all these labours‚Äô period.
‚Ä≠     Here stay then till th‚Äô eleventh or twelfth day‚Äôs light,
‚Ä≠  And I‚Äôll dismiss thee well, gifts exquisite
‚Ä≠  Preparing for thee, chariot, horses three,
‚Ä≠  A cup of curious frame to serve for thee
‚Ä≠  To serve th‚Äô immortal Gods with sacrifice,
‚Ä≠  Mindful of me while all suns light thy skies.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúStay me not too long time here,
‚Ä≠  Though I could sit attending all the year.
‚Ä≠  Nor should my house, nor parents, with desire,
‚Ä≠  Take my affections from you, so on fire
‚Ä≠  With love to hear you are my thoughts; but so
‚Ä≠  My Pylian friends I shall afflict with woe
‚Ä≠  Who mourn ev‚Äôn this stay.  Whatsoever be
‚Ä≠  The gifts your grace is to bestow on me,
‚Ä≠  Vouchsafe them such as I may bear and save
‚Ä≠  For your sake ever.  Horse, I list not have,
‚Ä≠  To keep in Ithaca, but leave them here,
‚Ä≠  To your soil‚Äôs dainties, where the broad fields bear
‚Ä≠  Sweet cypers grass, where men-fed lote doth flow,
‚Ä≠  Where wheat-like spelt, and wheat itself, doth grow,
‚Ä≠  Where barley, white, and spreading like a tree;
‚Ä≠  But Ithaca hath neither ground to be,
‚Ä≠  For any length it comprehends, a race
‚Ä≠  To try a horse‚Äôs speed, nor any place
‚Ä≠  To make him fat in; fitter far to feed
‚Ä≠  A cliff-bred goat, than raise or please a steed.
‚Ä≠  Of all isles, Ithaca doth least provide
‚Ä≠  Or meads to feed a horse, or ways to ride.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He, smiling, said:  ‚ÄúOf good blood art thou, son.
‚Ä≠  What speech, so young!  What observati√≥n
‚Ä≠  Hast thou made of the world!  I well am pleas‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To change my gifts to thee, as being confess‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Unfit indeed, my store is such I may.
‚Ä≠  Of all my house-gifts then, that up I lay
‚Ä≠  For treasure there, I will bestow on thee
‚Ä≠  The fairest, and of greatest price to me.
‚Ä≠  I will bestow on thee a rich carv‚Äôd cup,
‚Ä≠  Of silver all, but all the brims wrought up
‚Ä≠  With finest gold; it was the only thing
‚Ä≠  That the heroical Sidonian king
‚Ä≠  Presented to me, when we were to part
‚Ä≠  At his receipt of me, and ‚Äôtwas the art
‚Ä≠  Of that great Artist that of heav‚Äôn is free;
‚Ä≠  And yet ev‚Äôn this will I bestow on thee.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This speech thus ended, guests came, and did bring
‚Ä≠  Muttons, for presents, to the God-like king,
‚Ä≠  And spirit-prompting wine, that strenuous makes.
‚Ä≠  Their riband-wreathed wives brought fruit and cakes.
‚Ä≠     Thus in this house did these their feast apply;
‚Ä≠  And in Ulysses‚Äô house activity
‚Ä≠  The Wooers practis‚Äôd; tossing of the spear,
‚Ä≠  The stone, and hurling; thus delighted, where
‚Ä≠  They exercis‚Äôd such insolence before,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn in the court that wealthy pavements wore
‚Ä≠  Antinous did still their strifes decide,
‚Ä≠  And he that was in person deified
‚Ä≠  Eurymachus; both ring-leaders of all,
‚Ä≠  For in their virtues they were principal.
‚Ä≠     These by No√´mon, son to Phronius,
‚Ä≠  Were sided now, who made the question thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAntinous!  Does any friend here know,
‚Ä≠  When this Telemachus returns, or no,
‚Ä≠  From sandy Pylos?  He made bold to take
‚Ä≠  My ship with him; of which, I now should make
‚Ä≠  Fit use myself, and sail in her as far
‚Ä≠  As spacious Elis, where of mine there are
‚Ä≠  Twelve delicate mares, and under their sides go
‚Ä≠  Laborious mules, that yet did never know
‚Ä≠  The yoke, nor labour; some of which should bear
‚Ä≠  The taming now, if I could fetch them there.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This speech the rest admir‚Äôd, nor dream‚Äôd that he
‚Ä≠  Nele√Øan Pylos ever thought to see,
‚Ä≠  But was at field about his flocks‚Äô survey,
‚Ä≠  Or thought his herdsmen held him so away.
‚Ä≠  Eupitheus son, Antinous, then replied:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúWhen went he, or with what train dignified?
‚Ä≠  Of his selected Ithacensian youth?
‚Ä≠  Prest men, or bond men, were they?  Tell the truth.
‚Ä≠  Could he effect this?  Let me truly know.
‚Ä≠  To gain thy vessel did he violence show,
‚Ä≠  And us‚Äôd her ‚Äôgainst thy will?  or had her free,
‚Ä≠  When fitting question he had made with thee?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     No√´mon answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúI did freely give
‚Ä≠  My vessel to him.  Who deserves to live
‚Ä≠  That would do other, when such men as he
‚Ä≠  Did in distress ask?  He should churlish be
‚Ä≠  That would deny him.  Of our youth the best
‚Ä≠  Amongst the people, to the interest
‚Ä≠  His charge did challenge in them, giving way,
‚Ä≠  With all the tribute all their pow‚Äôrs could pay.
‚Ä≠  Their captain, as he took the ship, I knew,
‚Ä≠  Who Mentor was, or God.  A Deity‚Äôs shew
‚Ä≠  Mask‚Äôd in his likeness.  But, to think ‚Äôtwas he,
‚Ä≠  I much admire, for I did clearly see,
‚Ä≠  But yester-morning, God-like Mentor here;
‚Ä≠  Yet th‚Äô other ev‚Äôning he took shipping there,
‚Ä≠  And went for Pylos.‚Äù  Thus went he for home,
‚Ä≠  And left the rest with envy overcome;
‚Ä≠  Who sat, and pastime left.  Eupitheus son,
‚Ä≠  Sad, and with rage his entrails overrun,
‚Ä≠  His eyes like flames, thus interpos‚Äôd his speech:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúStrange thing!  An action of how proud a reach
‚Ä≠  Is here committed by Telemachus!
‚Ä≠  A boy, a child, and we, a sort of us,
‚Ä≠  Vow‚Äôd ‚Äôgainst his voyage, yet admit it thus!
‚Ä≠  With ship and choice youth of our people too!
‚Ä≠  But let him on, and all his mischief do,
‚Ä≠  Jove shall convert upon himself his pow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  Before their ill presum‚Äôd he brings on ours.
‚Ä≠  Provide me then a ship, and twenty men
‚Ä≠  To give her manage, that, against again
‚Ä≠  He turns for home, on th‚Äô Ithacensian seas,
‚Ä≠  Or cliffy Samian, I may interprease,
‚Ä≠  Way-lay, and take him, and make all his craft
‚Ä≠  Sail with his ruin for his father saft.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This all applauded, and gave charge to do,
‚Ä≠  Rose, and to greet Ulysses‚Äô house did go.
‚Ä≠  But long time past not, ere Penelope
‚Ä≠  Had notice of their far-fetch‚Äôd treachery.
‚Ä≠  Medon the herald told her, who had heard
‚Ä≠  Without the hall how they within conferr‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And hasted straight to tell it to the queen,
‚Ä≠  Who, from the entry having Medon seen,
‚Ä≠  Prevents him thus:  ‚ÄúNow herald, what affair
‚Ä≠  Intend the famous Wooers, in your repair?
‚Ä≠  To tell Ulysses‚Äô maids that they must cease
‚Ä≠  From doing our work, and their banquets dress?
‚Ä≠  I would to heav‚Äôn, that, leaving wooing me,
‚Ä≠  Nor ever troubling other company,
‚Ä≠  Here might the last feast be, and most extreme,
‚Ä≠  That ever any shall address for them.
‚Ä≠  They never meet but to consent in spoil,
‚Ä≠  And reap the free fruits of another‚Äôs toil.
‚Ä≠  O did they never, when they children were,
‚Ä≠  What to their fathers was Ulysses, hear?
‚Ä≠  Who never did ‚Äôgainst anyone proceed
‚Ä≠  With unjust usage, or in word or deed?
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTis yet with other kings another right,
‚Ä≠  One to pursue with love, another spite;
‚Ä≠  He still yet just, nor would, though might, devour,
‚Ä≠  Nor to the worst did ever taste of pow‚Äôr.
‚Ä≠  But their unrul‚Äôd acts show their minds‚Äô estate.
‚Ä≠  Good turns receiv‚Äôd once, thanks grow out of date.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Medon, the learn‚Äôd in wisdom, answer‚Äôd her:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúI wish, O queen, that their ingratitudes were
‚Ä≠  Their worst ill towards you; but worse by far,
‚Ä≠  And much more deadly, their endeavours are,
‚Ä≠  Which Jove will fail them in.  Telemachus
‚Ä≠  Their purpose is, as he returns to us,
‚Ä≠  To give their sharp steels in a cruel death;
‚Ä≠  Who now is gone to learn, if fame can breathe
‚Ä≠  News of his sire, and will the Pylian shore,
‚Ä≠  And sacred Sparta, in his search explore.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This news dissolv‚Äôd to her both knees and heart,
‚Ä≠  Long silence held her ere one word would part,
‚Ä≠  Her eyes stood full of tears, her small soft voice
‚Ä≠  All late use lost; that yet at last had choice
‚Ä≠  Of wonted words, which briefly thus she us‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúWhy left my son his mother?  Why refus‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His wit the solid shore, to try the seas,
‚Ä≠  And put in ships the trust of his distress,
‚Ä≠  That are at sea to men unbridled horse,
‚Ä≠  And run, past rule, their far-engag√©d course,
‚Ä≠  Amidst a moisture past all mean unstaid?
‚Ä≠  No need compell‚Äôd this.  Did he it, afraid
‚Ä≠  To live and leave posterity his name?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI know not,‚Äù  he replied,  ‚Äúif th‚Äô humour came
‚Ä≠  From current of his own instinct, or flow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  From others‚Äô instigations; but he vow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Attempt to Pylos, or to see descried
‚Ä≠  His sire‚Äôs return, or know what death he died.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he took him to Ulysses‚Äô house
‚Ä≠  After the Wooers; the Ulyssean spouse,
‚Ä≠  Run through with woes, let Torture seize her mind,
‚Ä≠  Nor in her choice of state chairs stood inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To take her seat, but th‚Äô abject threshold chose
‚Ä≠  Of her fair chamber for her loath‚Äôd repose,
‚Ä≠  And mourn‚Äôd most wretch-like.  Round about her fell
‚Ä≠  Her handmaids, join‚Äôd in a continuate yell.
‚Ä≠  From ev‚Äôry corner of the palace, all
‚Ä≠  Of all degrees tun‚Äôd to her comfort‚Äôs fall
‚Ä≠  Their own dejections; to whom her complaint
‚Ä≠  She thus enforc‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúThe Gods, beyond constraint
‚Ä≠  Of any measure, urge these tears on me;
‚Ä≠  Nor was there ever dame of my degree
‚Ä≠  So past degree griev‚Äôd.  First, a lord so good,
‚Ä≠  That had such hardy spirits in his blood,
‚Ä≠  That all the virtues was adorn‚Äôd withall,
‚Ä≠  That all the Greeks did their superior call,
‚Ä≠  To part with thus, and lose!  And now a son,
‚Ä≠  So worthily belov‚Äôd, a course to run
‚Ä≠  Beyond my knowledge; whom rude tempests have
‚Ä≠  Made far from home his most inglorious grave!
‚Ä≠  Unhappy wenches, that no one of all
‚Ä≠  (Though in the reach of ev‚Äôry one must fall
‚Ä≠  His taking ship) sustain‚Äôd the careful mind,
‚Ä≠  To call me from my bed, who this design‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  And most vow‚Äôd course in him had either stay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  How much soever hasted, or dead laid
‚Ä≠  He should have left me.  Many a man I have,
‚Ä≠  That would have call‚Äôd old Dolius my slave,
‚Ä≠  (That keeps my orchard, whom my father gave
‚Ä≠  At my departure) to have run, and told
‚Ä≠  Laertes this; to try if he could hold
‚Ä≠  From running through the people, and from tears,
‚Ä≠  In telling them of these vow‚Äôd murderers;
‚Ä≠  That both divine Ulysses‚Äô hope, and his,
‚Ä≠  Resolv‚Äôd to end in their conspiracies.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     His nurse then, Euryclea, made reply:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúDear sov‚Äôreign, let me with your own hands die,
‚Ä≠  Or cast me off here, I‚Äôll not keep from thee
‚Ä≠  One word of what I know.  He trusted me
‚Ä≠  With all his purpose, and I gave him all
‚Ä≠  The bread and wine for which he pleas‚Äôd to call.
‚Ä≠  But then a mighty oath he made me swear,
‚Ä≠  Not to report it to your royal ear
‚Ä≠  Before the twelfth day either should appear,
‚Ä≠  Or you should ask me when you heard him gone.
‚Ä≠  Impair not then your beauties with your moan,
‚Ä≠  But wash, and put untear-stain‚Äôd garments on,
‚Ä≠  Ascend your chamber with your ladies here,
‚Ä≠  And pray the seed of goat-nurs‚Äôd Jupiter,
‚Ä≠  Divine Athenia, to preserve your son,
‚Ä≠  And she will save him from confusi√≥n,
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô old king, to whom your hopes stand so inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  For his grave counsels, you perhaps may find
‚Ä≠  Unfit affected, for his age‚Äôs sake.
‚Ä≠  But heav‚Äôn-kings wax not old, and therefore make
‚Ä≠  Fit pray‚Äôrs to them; for my thoughts never will
‚Ä≠  Believe the heav‚Äônly Pow‚Äôrs conceit so ill
‚Ä≠  The seed of righteous Arcesiades,
‚Ä≠  To end it utterly, but still will please
‚Ä≠  In some place evermore some one of them
‚Ä≠  To save, and deck him with a diadem,
‚Ä≠  Give him possession of erected tow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  And far-stretch‚Äôd fields, crown‚Äôd all of fruits and flowr‚Äôs.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This eas‚Äôd her heart, and dried her humorous eyes,
‚Ä≠  When having wash‚Äôd, and weeds of sacrifice
‚Ä≠  Pure, and unstain‚Äôd with her distrustful tears,
‚Ä≠  Put on, with all her women-ministers
‚Ä≠  Up to a chamber of most height she rose,
‚Ä≠  And cakes of salt and barley did impose
‚Ä≠  Within a wicker basket; all which broke
‚Ä≠  In decent order, thus she did invoke:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúGreat Virgin of the goat-preserv√©d God,
‚Ä≠  If ever the inhabited abode
‚Ä≠  Of wise Ulysses held the fatted thighs
‚Ä≠  Of sheep and oxen, made thy sacrifice
‚Ä≠  By his devotion, hear me, nor forget
‚Ä≠  His pious services, but safe see set
‚Ä≠  His dear son on these shores, and banish hence
‚Ä≠  These Wooers past all mean in insolence.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, she shriek‚Äôd, and Pallas heard her pray‚Äôr.
‚Ä≠  The Wooers broke with tumult all the air
‚Ä≠  About the shady house; and one of them,
‚Ä≠  Whose pride his youth had made the more extreme,
‚Ä≠  Said:  ‚ÄúNow the many-wooer-honour‚Äôd queen
‚Ä≠  Will surely satiate her delayful spleen,
‚Ä≠  And one of us in instant nuptials take.
‚Ä≠  Poor dame, she dreams not, what design we make
‚Ä≠  Upon the life and slaughter of her son.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     So said he; but so said was not so done;
‚Ä≠  Whose arrogant spirit in a vaunt so vain
‚Ä≠  Antinous chid, and said:  ‚ÄúFor shame, contain
‚Ä≠  These braving speeches.  Who can tell who hears?
‚Ä≠  Are we not now in reach of others‚Äô ears?
‚Ä≠  If our intentions please us, let us call
‚Ä≠  Our spirits up to them, and let speeches fall.
‚Ä≠  By watchful danger men must silent go.
‚Ä≠  What we resolve on, let‚Äôs not say, but do.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said, he choos‚Äôd out twenty men, that bore
‚Ä≠  Best reckoning with him, and to ship and shore
‚Ä≠  All hasted, reach‚Äôd the ship, launch‚Äôd, rais‚Äôd the mast,
‚Ä≠  Put sails in, and with leather loops made fast
‚Ä≠  The oars; sails hoisted, arms their men did bring,
‚Ä≠  All giving speed and form to ev‚Äôrything.
‚Ä≠  Then to the high deeps their rigg‚Äôd vessel driven,
‚Ä≠  They supp‚Äôd, expecting the approaching even.
‚Ä≠     Mean space, Penelope her chamber kept
‚Ä≠  And bed, and neither eat, nor drank, nor slept,
‚Ä≠  Her strong thoughts wrought so on her blameless son,
‚Ä≠  Still in contention, if he should be done
‚Ä≠  To death, or ‚Äòscape the impious Wooers‚Äô design.
‚Ä≠  Look how a lion, whom men-troops combine
‚Ä≠  To hunt, and close him in a crafty ring,
‚Ä≠  Much varied thought conceives, and fear doth sting
‚Ä≠  For urgent danger; so far‚Äôd she, till sleep
‚Ä≠  All juncture of her joints and nerves did steep
‚Ä≠  In his dissolving humour.  When, at rest,
‚Ä≠  Pallas her favours varied, when addrest
‚Ä≠  An idol, that Iphthima did present
‚Ä≠  In structure of her ev‚Äôry lineament,  [5]
‚Ä≠  Great-soul‚Äôd Icarius‚Äô daughter, whom for spouse
‚Ä≠  Eumelus took, that kept in Pheris‚Äô house.
‚Ä≠  This to divine Ulysses‚Äô house she sent,
‚Ä≠  To try her best mean how she might content
‚Ä≠  Mournful Penelope, and make relent
‚Ä≠  The strict addiction in her to deplore.
‚Ä≠  This idol, like a worm, that less or more  [6]
‚Ä≠  Contracts or strains her, did itself convey,
‚Ä≠  Beyond the wards or windings of the key,
‚Ä≠  Into the chamber, and, above her head
‚Ä≠  Her seat assuming, thus she comforted
‚Ä≠  Distress‚Äôd Penelope:  ‚ÄúDoth sleep thus seize
‚Ä≠  Thy pow‚Äôrs, affected with so much dis-ease?
‚Ä≠  The Gods, that nothing troubles, will not see
‚Ä≠  Thy tears nor griefs, in any least degree,
‚Ä≠  Sustain‚Äôd with cause, for they will guard thy son
‚Ä≠  Safe to his wish‚Äôd and native mansi√≥n.
‚Ä≠  Since he is no offender of their states,
‚Ä≠  And they to such are firmer than their fates.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The wise Penelope receiv‚Äôd her thus,
‚Ä≠  Bound with a slumber most delicious,
‚Ä≠  And in the port of dreams:  ‚ÄúO sister, why
‚Ä≠  Repair you hither, since so far off lie
‚Ä≠  Your house and household?  You were never here
‚Ä≠  Before this hour, and would you now give cheer
‚Ä≠  To my so many woes and miseries,
‚Ä≠  Affecting fitly all the faculties
‚Ä≠  My soul and mind hold, having lost before
‚Ä≠  A husband, that of all the virtues bore
‚Ä≠  The palm amongst the Greeks, and whose renown
‚Ä≠  So ample was that Fame the sound hath blown
‚Ä≠  Through Greece and Argos to her very heart?
‚Ä≠  And now again, a son, that did convert
‚Ä≠  My whole pow‚Äôrs to his love, by ship is gone;
‚Ä≠  A tender plant, that yet was never grown
‚Ä≠  To labour‚Äôs taste, nor the commerce of men;
‚Ä≠  For whom more than my husband I complain,
‚Ä≠  And lest he should at any suff‚Äôrance touch
‚Ä≠  (Or in the sea, or by the men so much
‚Ä≠  Estrang‚Äôd to him that must his consorts be)
‚Ä≠  Fear and chill tremblings shake each joint of me.
‚Ä≠  Besides, his danger sets on foes profess‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To way-lay his return, that have address‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Plots for his death.‚Äù  The scarce-discern√©d Dream,
‚Ä≠  Said:  ‚ÄúBe of comfort, nor fears so extreme
‚Ä≠  Let thus dismay thee; thou hast such a mate
‚Ä≠  Attending thee, as some at any rate
‚Ä≠  Would wish to purchase, for her pow‚Äôr is great;
‚Ä≠  Minerva pities thy delights‚Äô defeat,
‚Ä≠  Whose grace hath sent me to foretell thee these.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúIf thou,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúbe of the Goddesses,
‚Ä≠  And heardst her tell thee these, thou mayst as well
‚Ä≠  From her tell all things else.  Deign then to tell,
‚Ä≠  If yet the man to all misfortunes born,
‚Ä≠  My husband, lives, and sees the sun adorn
‚Ä≠  The darksome earth, or hides his wretched head
‚Ä≠  In Pluto‚Äôs house, and lives amongst the dead?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI will not,‚Äù  she replied,  ‚Äúmy breath exhale
‚Ä≠  In one continued and perpetual tale,
‚Ä≠  Lives he or dies he.  ‚ÄôTis a filthy use,
‚Ä≠  To be in vain and idle speech profuse.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said, she, through the key-hole of the door,
‚Ä≠  Vanish‚Äôd again into the open blore.
‚Ä≠  Icarius‚Äô daughter started from her sleep,
‚Ä≠  And Joy‚Äôs fresh humour her lov‚Äôd breast did steep,
‚Ä≠  When now so clear, in that first watch of night,
‚Ä≠  She saw the seen Dream vanish from her sight.
‚Ä≠     The Wooers‚Äô ship the sea‚Äôs moist waves did ply,
‚Ä≠  And thought the prince a haughty death should die.
‚Ä≠  There lies a certain island in the sea,
‚Ä≠  Twixt rocky Samos and rough Ithaca,
‚Ä≠  That cliffy is itself, and nothing great,
‚Ä≠  Yet holds convenient havens that two ways let
‚Ä≠  Ships in and out, call‚Äôd Asteris; and there
‚Ä≠  The Wooers hop‚Äôd to make their massacre.

‚Ä≠  THE FIFTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  A second Court on Jove attends;
‚Ä≠  Who Hermes to Calypso sends,
‚Ä≠  Commanding her to clear the ways
‚Ä≠  Ulysses sought; and she obeys.
‚Ä≠  When Neptune saw Ulysses free,
‚Ä≠  And so in safety plough the sea,
‚Ä≠  Enrag‚Äôd, he ruffles up the waves,
‚Ä≠  And splits his ship.  Leucothea saves
‚Ä≠  His person yet, as being a Dame
‚Ä≠  Whose Godhead govern‚Äôd in the frame
‚Ä≠  Of those seas‚Äô tempers. But the mean,
‚Ä≠  By which she curbs dread Neptune‚Äôs spleen,
‚Ä≠  Is made a jewel, which she takes
‚Ä≠  From off her head, and that she makes
‚Ä≠  Ulysses on his bosom wear,
‚Ä≠  About his neck, she ties it there,
‚Ä≠  And, when he is with waves beset,
‚Ä≠  Bids wear it as an amulet,
‚Ä≠  Commanding him, that not before
‚Ä≠  He touch‚Äôd upon Ph√¶acia‚Äôs shore,
‚Ä≠  He should not part with it, but then
‚Ä≠  Return it to the sea again,
‚Ä≠  And cast it from him. He performs;
‚Ä≠  Yet, after this, bides bitter storms,
‚Ä≠  And in the rocks sees death engrav‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  But on Ph√¶acia‚Äôs shore is sav‚Äôd.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  E.
‚Ä≠     Ulysses builds
‚Ä≠        A ship; and gains
‚Ä≠     The glassy fields;
‚Ä≠        Pays Neptune pains.

‚Ä≠  Aurora rose from high-born Tithon‚Äôs bed,
‚Ä≠  That men and Gods might be illustrated,
‚Ä≠  And then the Deities sat.  Imperial Jove,
‚Ä≠  That makes the horrid murmur beat above,
‚Ä≠  Took place past all, whose height for ever springs,
‚Ä≠  And from whom flowers th‚Äô eternal pow‚Äôr of things.
‚Ä≠     Then Pallas, mindful of Ulysses, told
‚Ä≠  The many cares that in Calypso‚Äôs hold
‚Ä≠  He still sustain‚Äôd, when he had felt before
‚Ä≠  So much affliction, and such dangers more.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO Father,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúand ye Ever-blest,
‚Ä≠  Give never king hereafter interest
‚Ä≠  In any aid of yours, by serving you,
‚Ä≠  By being gentle, human, just, but grow
‚Ä≠  Rude, and for ever scornful of your rights,
‚Ä≠  All justice ord‚Äôring by their appetites,
‚Ä≠  Since he, that rul‚Äôd as it in right behov‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  That all his subjects as his children lov‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Finds you so thoughtless of him and his birth.
‚Ä≠  Thus men begin to say, ye rule in earth,
‚Ä≠  And grudge at what ye let him undergo,
‚Ä≠  Who yet the least part of his suff‚Äôrance know:
‚Ä≠  Thrall‚Äôd in an island, shipwrack‚Äôd in his tears,
‚Ä≠  And, in the fancies that Calypso bears,
‚Ä≠  Bound from his birthright, all his shipping gone,
‚Ä≠  And of his soldiers not retaining one.
‚Ä≠  And now his most-lov‚Äôd son‚Äôs life doth inflame
‚Ä≠  Their slaught‚Äôrous envies; since his father‚Äôs fame
‚Ä≠  He puts in pursuit, and is gone as far
‚Ä≠  As sacred Pylos, and the singular
‚Ä≠  Dame-breeding Sparta.‚Äù  This, with this reply,
‚Ä≠  The Cloud-assembler answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúWhat words fly
‚Ä≠  Thine own remembrance, daughter?  Hast not thou
‚Ä≠  The counsel giv‚Äôn thyself, that told thee how
‚Ä≠  Ulysses shall with his return address
‚Ä≠  His Wooers wrong?  And, for the safe access
‚Ä≠  His son shall make to his innative port,
‚Ä≠  Do thou direct it, in as curious sort
‚Ä≠  As thy wit serves thee; it obeys thy pow‚Äôrs;
‚Ä≠  And in their ship return the speedless Wooers.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Then turn‚Äôd he to his issue Mercury,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúThou hast made good our ambassy
‚Ä≠  To th‚Äô other Statists, to the Nymph then now,
‚Ä≠  On whose fair head a tuft of gold doth grow,
‚Ä≠  Bear our true-spoken counsel, for retreat
‚Ä≠  Of patient Ulysses; who shall get
‚Ä≠  No aid from us, nor any mortal man,
‚Ä≠  But in a patch‚Äôd-up skiff (built as he can,  [1]
‚Ä≠  And suff‚Äôring woes enough) the twentieth day
‚Ä≠  At fruitful Scheria let him breathe his way,
‚Ä≠  With the Ph√¶acians, that half Deities live,
‚Ä≠  Who like a God will honour him, and give
‚Ä≠  His wisdom clothes, and ship, and brass, and gold,
‚Ä≠  More than for gain of Troy he ever told;
‚Ä≠  Where, at the whole division of the prey,
‚Ä≠  If he a saver were, or got away
‚Ä≠  Without a wound, if he should grudge, ‚Äôtwas well.
‚Ä≠  But th‚Äô end shall crown all; therefore Fate will deal
‚Ä≠  So well with him, to let him land, and see
‚Ä≠  His native earth, friends, house, and family.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus charg‚Äôd he; nor Argicides denied,
‚Ä≠  But to his feet his fair wing‚Äôd shoes he tied,
‚Ä≠  Ambrosian, golden, that in his command
‚Ä≠  Put either sea, or the unmeasur‚Äôd land,
‚Ä≠  With pace as speedy as a puft of wind.
‚Ä≠  Then up his rod went, with which he declin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The eyes of any waker, when he pleas‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And any sleeper, when he wish‚Äôd, diseas‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     This took; he stoop‚Äôd Pieria, and thence
‚Ä≠  Glid through the air, and Neptune‚Äôs confluence
‚Ä≠  Kiss‚Äôd as he flew, and check‚Äôd the waves as light
‚Ä≠  As any sea-mew in her fishing flight,
‚Ä≠  Her thick wings sousing in the savory seas.
‚Ä≠  Like her, he pass‚Äôd a world of wilderness;
‚Ä≠  But when the far-off isle he touch‚Äôd, he went
‚Ä≠  Up from the blue sea to the continent,
‚Ä≠  And reach‚Äôd the ample cavern of the Queen,
‚Ä≠  Whom he within found, without seldom seen.
‚Ä≠  A sun-like fire upon the hearth did flame,
‚Ä≠  The matter precious, and divine the frame,
‚Ä≠  Of cedar cleft and incense was the pile,
‚Ä≠  That breath‚Äôd an odour round about the isle.
‚Ä≠  Herself was seated in an inner room,
‚Ä≠  Whom sweetly sing he heard, and at her loom,
‚Ä≠  About a curious web, whose yarn she threw
‚Ä≠  In with a golden shittle.  A grove grew
‚Ä≠  In endless spring about her cavern round,
‚Ä≠  With odorous cypress, pines, and poplars, crown‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Where hawks, sea-owls, and long-tongued bittours bred,
‚Ä≠  And other birds their shady pinions spread;
‚Ä≠  All fowls maritimal; none roosted there,
‚Ä≠  But those whose labours in the waters were.
‚Ä≠  A vine did all the hollow cave embrace,
‚Ä≠  Still green, yet still ripe bunches gave it grace.
‚Ä≠  Four fountains, one against another, pour‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Their silver streams; and meadows all enflower‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With sweet balm-gentle, and blue-violets hid,
‚Ä≠  That deck‚Äôd the soft breasts of each fragrant mead.
‚Ä≠  Should anyone, though he immortal were,
‚Ä≠  Arrive and see the sacred objects there,
‚Ä≠  He would admire them, and be over-joy‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  And so stood Hermes‚Äô ravish‚Äôd pow‚Äôrs employ‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠     But having all admir‚Äôd, he enter‚Äôd on
‚Ä≠  The ample cave, nor could be seen unknown
‚Ä≠  Of great Calypso (for all Deities are
‚Ä≠  Prompt in each other‚Äôs knowledge, though so far
‚Ä≠  Sever‚Äôd in dwellings) but he could not see
‚Ä≠  Ulysses there within; without was he,
‚Ä≠  Set sad ashore, where ‚Äôtwas his use to view
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô unquiet sea, sigh‚Äôd, wept, and empty drew
‚Ä≠  His heart of comfort.  Plac‚Äôd here in her throne,
‚Ä≠  That beams cast up to admirati√≥n,
‚Ä≠  Divine Calypso question‚Äôd Hermes thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúFor what cause, dear, and much-esteem‚Äôd by us,
‚Ä≠  Thou golden-rod-adorned Mercury,
‚Ä≠  Arriv‚Äôst thou here? Thou hast not us‚Äôd t‚Äô apply
‚Ä≠  Thy passage this way.  Say, whatever be
‚Ä≠  Thy heart‚Äôs desire, my mind commands it thee,
‚Ä≠  If in my means it lie, or pow‚Äôr of fact.
‚Ä≠  But first, what hospitable rites exact,
‚Ä≠  Come yet more near, and take.‚Äù  This said, she set
‚Ä≠  A table forth, and furnish‚Äôd it with meat,
‚Ä≠  Such as the Gods taste; and serv‚Äôd in with it
‚Ä≠  Vermilion nectar.  When with banquet fit
‚Ä≠  He had confirm‚Äôd his spirits, he thus exprest
‚Ä≠  His cause of coming:  ‚ÄúThou hast made request,
‚Ä≠  Goddess of Goddesses, to understand
‚Ä≠  My cause of touch here; which thou shalt command,
‚Ä≠  And know with truth: Jove caus‚Äôd my course to thee
‚Ä≠  Against my will, for who would willingly
‚Ä≠  Lackey along so vast a lake of brine,
‚Ä≠  Near to no city that the Pow‚Äôrs divine
‚Ä≠  Receives with solemn rites and hecatombs?
‚Ä≠  But Jove‚Äôs will ever all law overcomes,
‚Ä≠  No other God can cross or make it void;
‚Ä≠  And he affirms, that one the most annoy‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With woes and toils of all those men that fought
‚Ä≠  For Priam‚Äôs city, and to end hath brought
‚Ä≠  Nine years in the contention, is with thee.
‚Ä≠  For in the tenth year, when roy victory
‚Ä≠  Was won to give the Greeks the spoil of Troy,
‚Ä≠  Return they did profess, but not enjoy,
‚Ä≠  Since Pallas they incens‚Äôd, and she the waves
‚Ä≠  By all the winds‚Äô pow‚Äôr, that blew ope their graves.
‚Ä≠  And there they rested.  Only this poor one
‚Ä≠  This coast both winds and waves have cast upon;
‚Ä≠  Whom now forthwith he wills thee to dismiss,
‚Ä≠  Affirming that th‚Äô unalter‚Äôd Destinies
‚Ä≠  Not only have decreed he shall not die
‚Ä≠  Apart his friends, but of necessity
‚Ä≠  Enjoy their sights before those fatal hours,
‚Ä≠  His country earth reach, and erected tow‚Äôrs.‚Äù
‚Ä≠      This struck a love-check‚Äôd horror through her pow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  When, naming him, she this reply did give:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúInsatiate are ye Gods, past all that live,
‚Ä≠  In all things you affect; which still converts
‚Ä≠  Your pow‚Äôrs to envies.  It afflicts your hearts,
‚Ä≠  That any Goddess should, as you obtain
‚Ä≠  The use of earthly dames, enjoy the men,
‚Ä≠  And most in open marriage.  So ye far‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  When the delicious-finger‚Äôd Morning shar‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Orion‚Äôs bed; you easy-living States
‚Ä≠  Could never satisfy your emulous hates,
‚Ä≠  Till in Ortygia the precise-liv‚Äôd Dame,
‚Ä≠  Gold-thron‚Äôd Diana, on him rudely came,
‚Ä≠  And with her swift shafts slew him.  And such pains,
‚Ä≠  When rich-hair‚Äôd Ceres pleas‚Äôd to give the reins
‚Ä≠  To her affections, and the grace did yield
‚Ä≠  Of love and bed, amidst a three-cropp‚Äôd field,
‚Ä≠  To her Iasion, he paid angry Jove,
‚Ä≠  Who lost no long time notice of their love,
‚Ä≠  But with a glowing lightning was his death.
‚Ä≠  And now your envies labour underneath
‚Ä≠  A mortal‚Äôs choice of mine; whose life I took
‚Ä≠  To lib‚Äôral safety, when his ship Jove strook,
‚Ä≠  With red-hot flashes, piece-meal in the seas,
‚Ä≠  And all his friends and soldiers succourless
‚Ä≠  Perish‚Äôd but he.  Him, cast upon this coast
‚Ä≠  With blasts and billows, I, in life giv‚Äôn lost,
‚Ä≠  Preserv‚Äôd alone, lov‚Äôd, nourish‚Äôd, and did vow
‚Ä≠  To make him deathless, and yet never grow
‚Ä≠  Crooked, or worn with age, his whole life long.
‚Ä≠  But since no reason may be made so strong
‚Ä≠  To strive with Jove‚Äôs will, or to make it vain,
‚Ä≠  No not if all the other Gods should strain
‚Ä≠  Their pow‚Äôrs against it, let his will be law,
‚Ä≠  So he afford him fit means to withdraw,
‚Ä≠  As he commands him, to the raging main.
‚Ä≠  But means from me he never shall obtain,
‚Ä≠  For my means yield nor men, nor ship, nor oars,
‚Ä≠  To set him off from my so envied shores.
‚Ä≠  But if my counsel and good will can aid
‚Ä≠  His safe pass home, my best shall be assay‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúVouchsafe it so,‚Äù  said heav‚Äôn‚Äôs ambassador,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúAnd deign it quickly.  By all means abhor
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô incense Jove‚Äôs wrath against thee, that with grace
‚Ä≠  He may hereafter all thy wish embrace.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus took the Argus-killing God his wings.
‚Ä≠  And since the rev‚Äôrend Nymph these awful things
‚Ä≠  Receiv‚Äôd from Jove, she to Ulysses went;
‚Ä≠  Whom she ashore found, drown‚Äôd in discontent,
‚Ä≠  His eyes kept never dry he did so mourn,
‚Ä≠  And waste his dear age for his wish‚Äôd return;
‚Ä≠  Which still without the cave he us‚Äôd to do,
‚Ä≠  Because he could not please the Goddess so,
‚Ä≠  At night yet, forc‚Äôd, together took their rest,
‚Ä≠  The willing Goddess and th‚Äô unwilling Guest;
‚Ä≠  But he all day in rocks, and on the shore,
‚Ä≠  The vex‚Äôd sea view‚Äôd, and did his fate deplore.
‚Ä≠  Him, now, the Goddess coming near bespake:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúUnhappy man, no more discomfort take
‚Ä≠  For my constraint of thee, nor waste thine age,
‚Ä≠  I now will passing freely disengage
‚Ä≠  Thy irksome stay here.  Come then, fell thee wood,
‚Ä≠  And build a ship, to save thee from the flood.
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll furnish thee with fresh wave, bread, and wine
‚Ä≠  Ruddy and sweet, that will the piner pine,  [2]
‚Ä≠  Put garments on thee, give the winds foreright,
‚Ä≠  That ev‚Äôry way thy home-bent appetite
‚Ä≠  May safe attain to it; if so it please
‚Ä≠  At all parts all the heav‚Äôn-hous‚Äôd Deities,
‚Ä≠  That more in pow‚Äôr are, more in skill, than I,
‚Ä≠  And more can judge what fits humanity.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He stood amaz‚Äôd at this strange change in her,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúO Goddess!   Thy intents prefer
‚Ä≠  Some other project than my parting hence,
‚Ä≠  Commanding things of too high consequence
‚Ä≠  For my performance, that myself should build
‚Ä≠  A ship of pow‚Äôr, my home-assays to shield
‚Ä≠  Against the great sea of such dread to pass;
‚Ä≠  Which not the best-built ship that ever was
‚Ä≠  Will pass exulting, when such winds, as Jove
‚Ä≠  Can thunder up, their trims and tacklings prove.
‚Ä≠  But could I build one, I would ne‚Äôer aboard,
‚Ä≠  Thy will oppos‚Äôd, nor, won, without thy word,
‚Ä≠  Giv‚Äôn in the great oath of the Gods to me,
‚Ä≠  Not to beguile me in the least degree.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The Goddess smil‚Äôd, held hard his hand, and said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúO y‚Äô are a shrewd one, and so habited
‚Ä≠  In taking heed thou know‚Äôst not what it is
‚Ä≠  To be unwary, nor use words amiss.
‚Ä≠  How hast thou charm‚Äôd me, were I ne‚Äôer so sly!
‚Ä≠  Let earth know then, and heav‚Äôn, so broad, so high,
‚Ä≠  And th‚Äô under-sunk waves of th‚Äô infernal stream,
‚Ä≠  (Which is an oath, as terribly supreme,
‚Ä≠  As any God swears) that I had no thought
‚Ä≠  But stood with what I spake, nor would have wrought,
‚Ä≠  Nor counsell‚Äôd, any act against thy good;
‚Ä≠  But ever diligently weigh‚Äôd, and stood
‚Ä≠  On those points in persuading thee, that I
‚Ä≠  Would use myself in such extremity.
‚Ä≠  For my mind simple is, and innocent,
‚Ä≠  Not giv‚Äôn by cruel sleights to circumvent,
‚Ä≠  Nor bear I in my breast a heart of steel,
‚Ä≠  But with the suff‚Äôrer willing suff‚Äôrance feel.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said, the Grace of Goddesses led home,
‚Ä≠  He trac‚Äôd her steps; and, to the cavern come,
‚Ä≠  In that rich throne, whence Mercury arose,
‚Ä≠  He sat.  The Nymph herself did then appose,
‚Ä≠  For food and bev‚Äôrage, to him all best meat
‚Ä≠  And drink, that mortals use to taste and eat.
‚Ä≠  Then sat she opposite, and for her feast
‚Ä≠  Was nectar and ambrosia addrest
‚Ä≠  By handmaids to her.  Both, what was prepar‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Did freely fall to.  Having fitly far‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  The Nymph Calypso this discourse began:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúJove-bred Ulysses!  Many-witted man!
‚Ä≠  Still is thy home so wish‚Äôd?  So soon, away?
‚Ä≠  Be still of cheer, for all the worst I say.
‚Ä≠  But, if thy soul knew what a sum of woes,
‚Ä≠  For thee to cast up, thy stern Fates impose,
‚Ä≠  Ere to thy country earth thy hopes attain,
‚Ä≠  Undoubtedly thy choice would here remain,
‚Ä≠  Keep house with me, and be a liver ever.
‚Ä≠  Which, methinks, should thy house and thee dissever,
‚Ä≠  Though for thy wife there thou art set on fire,
‚Ä≠  And all thy days are spent in her desire;
‚Ä≠  And though it be no boast in me to say
‚Ä≠  In form and mind I match her ev‚Äôry way.
‚Ä≠  Nor can it fit a mortal dame‚Äôs compare,
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô affect those terms with us that deathless are.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The great-in-counsels made her this reply:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúRenown‚Äôd, and to be rev‚Äôrenc‚Äôd, Deity!
‚Ä≠  Let it not move thee, that so much I vow
‚Ä≠  My comforts to my wife; though well I know
‚Ä≠  All cause myself why wise Penelope
‚Ä≠  In wit is far inferior to thee,
‚Ä≠  In feature, stature, all the parts of show,
‚Ä≠  She being a mortal, an immortal thou,
‚Ä≠  Old ever growing, and yet never old.
‚Ä≠  Yet her desire shall all my days see told,
‚Ä≠  Adding the sight of my returning day,
‚Ä≠  And natural home.  If any God shall lay
‚Ä≠  His hand upon me as I pass the seas,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll bear the worst of what his hand shall please,
‚Ä≠  As having giv‚Äôn me such a mind as shall
‚Ä≠  The more still rise the more his hand lets fall.
‚Ä≠  In wars and waves my suff‚Äôrings were not small.
‚Ä≠  I now have suffer‚Äôd much, as much before,
‚Ä≠  Hereafter let as much result, and more.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, the sun set, and earth shadows gave;
‚Ä≠  When these two (in an in-room of the cave,
‚Ä≠  Left to themselves) left love no rites undone.
‚Ä≠  The early Morn up, up he rose, put on
‚Ä≠  His in and out weed.  She herself enchaces
‚Ä≠  Amidst a white robe, full of all the Graces,
‚Ä≠  Ample, and pleated thick like fishy scales;
‚Ä≠  A golden girdle then her waist impales;
‚Ä≠  Her head a veil decks; and abroad they come.
‚Ä≠  And now began Ulysses to go home.
‚Ä≠     A great axe first she gave, that two ways cut,
‚Ä≠  In which a fair well-polish‚Äôd helm was put,
‚Ä≠  That from an olive bough receiv‚Äôd his frame.
‚Ä≠  A plainer then.  Then led she, till they came
‚Ä≠  To lofty woods that did the isle confine.
‚Ä≠  The fir-tree, poplar, and heav‚Äôn-scaling pine,
‚Ä≠  Had there their offspring.  Of which, those that were
‚Ä≠  Of driest matter, and grew longest there,
‚Ä≠  He choos‚Äôd for lighter sail.  This place thus shown,
‚Ä≠  The Nymph turn‚Äôd home.  He fell to felling down,
‚Ä≠  And twenty trees he stoop‚Äôd in little space,
‚Ä≠  Plain‚Äôd, used his plumb, did all with artful grace.
‚Ä≠  In mean time did Calypso wimbles bring.
‚Ä≠  He bor‚Äôd, clos‚Äôd, nail‚Äôd, and order‚Äôd ev‚Äôry thing,
‚Ä≠  And look how much a ship-wright will allow
‚Ä≠  A ship of burden (one that best doth know
‚Ä≠  What fits his art) so large a keel he cast,
‚Ä≠  Wrought up her decks, and hatches, side-boards, mast,
‚Ä≠  With willow watlings arm‚Äôd her to resist
‚Ä≠  The billows‚Äô outrage, added all she miss‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Sail-yards, and stern for guide.  The Nymph then brought
‚Ä≠  Linen for sails, which with dispatch he wrought,
‚Ä≠  Gables, and halsters, tacklings.  All the frame
‚Ä≠  In four days‚Äô space to full perfection came.  [3]
‚Ä≠  The fifth day, they dismiss‚Äôd him from the shore,
‚Ä≠  Weeds neat, and odorous, gave him, victuals store,
‚Ä≠  Wine, strong waters, and a prosp‚Äôrous wind,
‚Ä≠  To which, Ulysses, fit-to-be-divin‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  His sails expos‚Äôd, and hois√©d.  Off he gat;
‚Ä≠  And cheerful was he.  At the stern he sat,
‚Ä≠  And steer‚Äôd right artfully.  Nor sleep could seize
‚Ä≠  His eye-lids.  He beheld the Pleiades;
‚Ä≠  The Bear, surnam‚Äôd the Wain, that round doth move
‚Ä≠  About Orion, and keeps still above
‚Ä≠  The billowy ocean; the slow-setting star
‚Ä≠  Bootes call‚Äôd, by some the Waggoner.
‚Ä≠     Calypso warn‚Äôd him he his course should steer
‚Ä≠  Still to his left hand.  Seventeen days did clear
‚Ä≠  The cloudy night‚Äôs command in his moist way,
‚Ä≠  And by the eighteenth light he might display
‚Ä≠  The shady hills of the Ph√¶acian shore,
‚Ä≠  For which, as to his next abode, he bore.
‚Ä≠  The country did a pretty figure yield,
‚Ä≠  And look‚Äôd from off the dark seas like a shield.
‚Ä≠     Imperious Neptune, making his retreat
‚Ä≠  From th‚Äô √Üthiopian earth, and taking seat
‚Ä≠  Upon the mountains of the Solymi,
‚Ä≠  From thence, far off discov‚Äôring, did descry
‚Ä≠  Ulysses his fields ploughing.  All on fire
‚Ä≠  The sight straight set his heart, and made desire
‚Ä≠  Of wreak run over, it did boil so high.
‚Ä≠  When, his head nodding;  ‚ÄúO impiety,‚Äù
‚Ä≠  He cried out,  ‚Äúnow the Gods‚Äô inconstancy
‚Ä≠  Is most apparent, alt‚Äôring their designs
‚Ä≠  Since I the √Üthiops saw, and here confines
‚Ä≠  To this Ulysses‚Äô fate his misery.
‚Ä≠  The great mark, on which all his hopes rely,
‚Ä≠  Lies in Ph√¶acia.  But I hope he shall
‚Ä≠  Feel woe at height, ere that dead calm befall.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said; he, begging, gather‚Äôd clouds from land,  [4]
‚Ä≠  Frighted the seas up, snatch‚Äôd into his hand
‚Ä≠  His horrid trident, and aloft did toss,
‚Ä≠  Of all the winds, all storms he could engross,
‚Ä≠  All earth took into sea with clouds, grim Night
‚Ä≠  Fell tumbling headlong from the cope of light,
‚Ä≠  The East and South winds justled in the air,
‚Ä≠  The violent Zephyr, and North making-fair,
‚Ä≠  Roll‚Äôd up the waves before them.  And then bent
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô knees, then all his spirit was spent.
‚Ä≠  In which despair, he thus spake:  ‚ÄúWoe is me!
‚Ä≠  What was I born to, man of misery!
‚Ä≠  Fear tells me now, that, all the Goddess said,
‚Ä≠  Truth‚Äôs self will author, that Fate would be paid
‚Ä≠  Grief‚Äôs whole sum due from me, at sea, before
‚Ä≠  I reach‚Äôd the dear touch of my country‚Äôs shore.
‚Ä≠  With what clouds Jove heav‚Äôn‚Äôs heighten‚Äôd forehead binds!
‚Ä≠  How tyrannize the wraths of all the winds!
‚Ä≠  How all the tops he bottoms with the deeps,
‚Ä≠  And in the bottoms all the tops he steeps!
‚Ä≠  Thus dreadful is the presence of our death.
‚Ä≠  Thrice four times blest were they that sunk beneath
‚Ä≠  Their fates at Troy, and did to nought contend
‚Ä≠  But to renown Atrides with their end!
‚Ä≠  I would to God, my hour of death and fate
‚Ä≠  That day had held the‚Äô pow‚Äôr to terminate,
‚Ä≠  When show‚Äôrs of darts my life bore undepress‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  About divine √Üacides deceas‚Äôd!
‚Ä≠  Then had I been allotted to have died,
‚Ä≠  By all the Greeks with fun‚Äôrals glorified,
‚Ä≠  (Whence death, encouraging good life, had grown)
‚Ä≠  Where now I die, by no man mourn‚Äôd nor known.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This spoke, a huge wave took him by the head,
‚Ä≠  And hurl‚Äôd him o‚Äôer board; ship and all it laid
‚Ä≠  Inverted quite amidst the waves, but he
‚Ä≠  Far off from her sprawl‚Äôd, strow‚Äôd about the sea,
‚Ä≠  His stern still holding broken off, his mast
‚Ä≠  Burst in the midst, so horrible a blast
‚Ä≠  Of mix‚Äôd winds struck it.  Sails and sail-yards fell
‚Ä≠  Amongst the billows; and himself did dwell
‚Ä≠  A long time under water, nor could get
‚Ä≠  In haste his head out, wave with wave so met
‚Ä≠  In his depression; and his garments too,
‚Ä≠  Giv‚Äôn by Calypso, gave him much to do,
‚Ä≠  Hind‚Äôring his swimming; yet he left not so
‚Ä≠  His drench√©d vessel, for the overthrow
‚Ä≠  Of her nor him, but gat at length again,
‚Ä≠  Wrastling with Neptune, hold of her; and then
‚Ä≠  Sat in her bulk, insulting over death,
‚Ä≠  Which, with the salt stream prest to stop his breath,
‚Ä≠  He ‚Äôscap‚Äôd, and gave the sea again to give
‚Ä≠  To other men.  His ship so striv‚Äôd to live,
‚Ä≠  Floating at random, cuff‚Äôd from wave to wave.
‚Ä≠  As you have seen the North wind when he drave
‚Ä≠  In autumn heaps of thorn-fed grasshoppers
‚Ä≠  Hither and thither, one heap this way bears,
‚Ä≠  Another that, and makes them often meet
‚Ä≠  in his confus‚Äôd gales; so Ulysses‚Äô fleet
‚Ä≠  The winds hurl‚Äôd up and down; now Boreas
‚Ä≠  Toss‚Äôd it to Notus, Notus gave it pass
‚Ä≠  To Eurus, Eurus Zephyr made pursue
‚Ä≠  The horrid tennis.  This sport call‚Äôd the view
‚Ä≠  Of Cadmus‚Äô daughter, with the narrow heel,
‚Ä≠  Ino Leucothea, that first did feel
‚Ä≠  A mortal dame‚Äôs desires, and had a tongue,
‚Ä≠  But now had th‚Äô honour to be nam‚Äôd among
‚Ä≠  The marine Godheads.  She with pity saw
‚Ä≠  Ulysses justled thus from flaw to flaw,
‚Ä≠  And, like a cormorant in form and flight,
‚Ä≠  Rose from a whirl-pool, on the ship did light,
‚Ä≠  And thus bespake him:  ‚ÄúWhy is Neptune thus
‚Ä≠  In thy pursuit extremely furious,
‚Ä≠  Oppressing thee with such a world of ill,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn to thy death?  He must not serve his will,
‚Ä≠  Though ‚Äôtis his study.  Let me then advise
‚Ä≠  As my thoughts serve; thou shalt not be unwise
‚Ä≠  To leave thy weeds and ship to the commands
‚Ä≠  Of these rude winds, and work out with thy hands
‚Ä≠  Pass to Ph√¶acia, where thy austere Fate
‚Ä≠  Is to pursue thee with no more such hate.
‚Ä≠  Take here this tablet, with this riband strung,
‚Ä≠  And see it still about thy bosom hung;
‚Ä≠  By whose eternal virtue never fear
‚Ä≠  To suffer thus again, nor perish here.
‚Ä≠  But when thou touchest with thy hand the shore,
‚Ä≠  Then take it from thy neck, nor wear it more,
‚Ä≠  But cast it far off from the continent,
‚Ä≠  And then thy person far ashore present.
‚Ä≠     Thus gave she him the tablet; and again,
‚Ä≠  Turn‚Äôd to a cormorant, div‚Äôd, past sight, the main.
‚Ä≠     Patient Ulysses sigh‚Äôd at this, and stuck
‚Ä≠  In the conceit of such fair-spoken luck,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúAlas!  I must suspect ev‚Äôn this,
‚Ä≠  Lest any other of the Deities
‚Ä≠  Add sleight to Neptune‚Äôs force, to counsel me
‚Ä≠  To leave my vessel, and so far off see
‚Ä≠  The shore I aim at.  Not with thoughts too clear
‚Ä≠  Will I obey her, but to me appear
‚Ä≠  These counsels best:  As long as I perceive
‚Ä≠  My ship not quite dissolv‚Äôd, I will not leave
‚Ä≠  The help she may afford me, but abide,
‚Ä≠  And suffer all woes till the worst be tried.
‚Ä≠  When she is split, I‚Äôll swim.  No miracle can,
‚Ä≠  Past near and clear means, move a knowing man.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     While this discourse employ‚Äôd him, Neptune rais‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A huge, a high, and horrid sea, that seiz‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Him and his ship, and toss‚Äôd them through the lake.
‚Ä≠  As when the violent winds together take
‚Ä≠  Heaps of dry chaff, and hurl them ev‚Äôry way;
‚Ä≠  So his long wood-stack Neptune strook astray
‚Ä≠     Then did Ulysses mount on rib, perforce,
‚Ä≠  Like to a rider of a running horse,
‚Ä≠  To stay himself a time, while he might shift
‚Ä≠  His drenched weeds, that were Calypso‚Äôs gift.
‚Ä≠  When putting straight Leucothea‚Äôs amulet
‚Ä≠  About his neck, he all his forces set
‚Ä≠  To swim, and cast him prostrate to the seas.
‚Ä≠  When pow‚Äôrful Neptune saw the ruthless prease
‚Ä≠  Of perils siege him thus, he mov‚Äôd his head,
‚Ä≠  And this betwixt him and his heart he said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúSo, now feel ills enow, and struggle so,
‚Ä≠  Till to your Jove-lov‚Äôd islanders you row.
‚Ä≠  But my mind says, you will not so avoid
‚Ä≠  This last task too, but be with suff‚Äôrance cloy‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, his rich-man‚Äôd horse he mov‚Äôd, and reach‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His house at √Ügas.  But Minerva fetch‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The winds from sea, and all their ways but one
‚Ä≠  Barr‚Äôd to their passage; the bleak North alone
‚Ä≠  She set to blow, the rest she charg‚Äôd to keep
‚Ä≠  Their rages in, and bind themselves in sleep.
‚Ä≠  But Boreas still flew high to break the seas,
‚Ä≠  Till Jove-bred Ithacus the more with ease
‚Ä≠  The navigation-skill‚Äôd Ph√¶acian states
‚Ä≠  Might make his refuge, Death and angry Fates
‚Ä≠  At length escaping.  Two nights, yet, and days
‚Ä≠  He spent in wrastling with the sable seas;
‚Ä≠  In which space, often did his heart propose
‚Ä≠  Death to his eyes.  But when Aurora rose,
‚Ä≠  And threw the third light from her orient hair,
‚Ä≠  The winds grew calm, and clear was all the air,
‚Ä≠  Not one breath stirring.  Then he might descry,
‚Ä≠  Rais‚Äôd by the high seas, clear, and land was nigh.
‚Ä≠  And then, look how to good sons that esteem
‚Ä≠  Their father‚Äôs life dear, (after pains extreme,
‚Ä≠  Felt in some sickness, that hath held him long
‚Ä≠  Down to his bed, and with affections strong
‚Ä≠  Wasted his body, made his life his load,
‚Ä≠  As being inflicted by some angry God)
‚Ä≠  When on their pray‚Äôrs they see descend at length
‚Ä≠  Health from the heav‚Äôns, clad all in spirit and strength,
‚Ä≠  The sight is precious; so, since here should end
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô toils, which therein should extend
‚Ä≠  Health to his country, held to him his sire
‚Ä≠  And on which long for him disease did tire,
‚Ä≠  And then, besides, for his own sake to see
‚Ä≠  The shores, the woods so near, such joy had he,
‚Ä≠  As those good sons for their recover‚Äôd sire.
‚Ä≠  Then labour‚Äôd feet and all parts to aspire
‚Ä≠  To that wish‚Äôd continent; which when as near
‚Ä≠  He came, as Clamour might inform an ear,
‚Ä≠  He heard a sound beat from the sea-bred rocks,
‚Ä≠  Against which gave a huge sea horrid shocks,
‚Ä≠  That belch‚Äôd upon the firm land weeds and foam,
‚Ä≠  With which were all things hid there, where no room
‚Ä≠  Of fit capacity was for any port,
‚Ä≠  Nor from the sea for any man‚Äôs resort,
‚Ä≠  The shores, the rocks, the cliff‚Äôs, so prominent were.
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúO,‚Äù  said Ulysses then,  ‚Äúnow Jupiter
‚Ä≠  Hath giv‚Äôn me sight of an unhop‚Äôd for shore,
‚Ä≠  Though I have wrought these seas so long, so sore.
‚Ä≠  Of rest yet no place shows the slend‚Äôrest prints,
‚Ä≠  The rugged shore so bristled is with flints,
‚Ä≠  Against which ev‚Äôry way the waves so flock,
‚Ä≠  And all the shore shows as one eminent rock,
‚Ä≠  So near which ‚Äôtis so deep, that not a sand
‚Ä≠  Is there for any tired foot to stand,
‚Ä≠  Nor fly his death-fast-following miseries,
‚Ä≠  Lest, if he land, upon him foreright flies
‚Ä≠  A churlish wave, to crush him ‚Äôgainst a cliff,
‚Ä≠  Worse than vain rend‚Äôring all his landing strife.
‚Ä≠  And should I swim to seek a hav‚Äôn elsewhere,
‚Ä≠  Or land less way-beat, I may justly fear
‚Ä≠  I shall be taken with a gale again,
‚Ä≠  And cast a huge way off into the main;
‚Ä≠  And there the great Earth-shaker (having seen
‚Ä≠  My so near landing, and again his spleen
‚Ä≠  Forcing me to him) will some whale send out,
‚Ä≠  (Of which a horrid number here about
‚Ä≠  His Amphitrite breeds) to swallow me.
‚Ä≠  I well have prov‚Äôd, with what malignity
‚Ä≠  He treads my steps.‚Äù  While this discourse he held,
‚Ä≠  A curs‚Äôd surge ‚Äôgainst a cutting rock impell‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His naked body, which it gash‚Äôd and tore,
‚Ä≠  And had his bones broke, if but one sea more
‚Ä≠  Had cast him on it.  But She prompted him,
‚Ä≠  That never fail‚Äôd, and bade him no more swim
‚Ä≠  Still off and on, but boldly force the shore,
‚Ä≠  And hug the rock that him so rudely tore;
‚Ä≠  Which he with both hands sigh‚Äôd and clasp‚Äôd, till past
‚Ä≠  The billow‚Äôs rage was; when ‚Äôscap‚Äôd, back so fast
‚Ä≠  The rock repuls‚Äôd it, that it reft his hold,
‚Ä≠  Sucking him from it, and far back he roll‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  And as the polypus that (forc‚Äôd from home
‚Ä≠  Amidst the soft sea, and near rough land come
‚Ä≠  For shelter ‚Äôgainst the storms that beat on her
‚Ä≠  At open sea, as she abroad doth err)
‚Ä≠  A deal of gravel, and sharp little stones,
‚Ä≠  Needfully gathers in her hollow bones;
‚Ä≠  So he forc‚Äôd hither by the sharper ill,
‚Ä≠  Shunning the smoother, where he best hop‚Äôd, still
‚Ä≠  The worst succeeded; for the cruel friend,
‚Ä≠  To which he cling‚Äôd for succour, off did rend
‚Ä≠  From his broad hands the soaken flesh so sore
‚Ä≠  That off he fell, and could sustain no more.
‚Ä≠  Quite under water fell he; and, past fate,
‚Ä≠  Hapless Ulysses there had lost the state
‚Ä≠  He held in life, if, still the grey-eyed Maid
‚Ä≠  His wisdom prompting, he had not assay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Another course, and ceas‚Äôd t‚Äô attempt that shore,
‚Ä≠  Swimming, and casting round his eye t‚Äô explore
‚Ä≠  Some other shelter.  Then the mouth he found
‚Ä≠  Of fair Callicoe‚Äôs flood, whose shores were crown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With most apt succours: rocks so smooth they seem‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Polish‚Äôd of purpose; land that quite redeem‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With breathless coverts th‚Äô others‚Äô blasted shores.
‚Ä≠  The flood he knew, and thus in heart implores:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúKing of this river, hear!  Whatever name
‚Ä≠  Makes thee invok‚Äôd, to thee I humbly frame
‚Ä≠  My flight from Neptune‚Äôs furies.  Rev‚Äôrend is
‚Ä≠  To all the ever-living Deities
‚Ä≠  What erring man soever seeks their aid.
‚Ä≠  To thy both flood and knees a man dismay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With varied suff‚Äôrance sues.  Yield then some rest
‚Ä≠  To him that is thy suppliant profest.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This, though but spoke in thought, the Godhead heard,
‚Ä≠  Her current straight stay‚Äôd, and her thick waves clear‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Before him, smooth‚Äôd her waters, and, just where
‚Ä≠  He pray‚Äôd half-drown‚Äôd, entirely sav‚Äôd him there.
‚Ä≠     Then forth he came, his both knees falt‚Äôring, both
‚Ä≠  His strong hands hanging down, and all with froth
‚Ä≠  His cheeks and nosthrils flowing, voice and breath
‚Ä≠  Spent to all use, and down he sunk to death.
‚Ä≠  The sea had soak‚Äôd his heart through; all his veins
‚Ä≠  His toils had rack‚Äôd t‚Äô a labouring woman‚Äôs pains.  [5]
‚Ä≠  Dead weary was he.  But when breath did find
‚Ä≠  A pass reciprocal, and in his mind
‚Ä≠  His spirit was recollected, up he rose,
‚Ä≠  And from his neck did th‚Äô amulet unloose,
‚Ä≠  That Ino gave him; which he hurl‚Äôd from him
‚Ä≠  To sea.  It sounding fell, and back did swim
‚Ä≠  With th‚Äô ebbing waters, till it straight arriv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Where Ino‚Äôs fair hand it again receiv‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Then kiss‚Äôd he th‚Äô humble earth; and on he goes,
‚Ä≠  Till bulrushes show‚Äôd place for his repose,
‚Ä≠  Where laid, he sigh‚Äôd, and thus said to his soul:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúO me, what strange perplexities control
‚Ä≠  The whole skill of thy pow‚Äôrs in this event!
‚Ä≠  What feel I?  If till care-nurse night be spent
‚Ä≠  I watch amidst the flood, the sea‚Äôs chill breath,
‚Ä≠  And vegetant dews, I fear will be my death,
‚Ä≠  So low brought with my labours.  Towards day
‚Ä≠  A passing sharp air ever breathes at sea.
‚Ä≠  If I the pitch of this next mountain scale,
‚Ä≠  And shady wood, and in some thicket fall
‚Ä≠  Into the hands of Sleep, though there the cold
‚Ä≠  May well be check‚Äôd, and healthful slumbers hold
‚Ä≠  Her sweet hand on my pow‚Äôrs, all care allay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Yet there will beasts devour me.  Best appaid
‚Ä≠  Doth that course make me yet; for there, some strife,
‚Ä≠  Strength, and my spirit, may make me make for life;
‚Ä≠  Which, though impair‚Äôd, may yet be fresh applied,
‚Ä≠  Where peril possible of escape is tried.
‚Ä≠  But he that fights with heav‚Äôn, or with the sea,
‚Ä≠  To indiscretion adds impiety.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus to the woods he hasted; which he found
‚Ä≠  Not far from sea, but on far-seeing ground,
‚Ä≠  Where two twin underwoods he enter‚Äôd on,
‚Ä≠  With olive-trees and oil-trees overgrown;
‚Ä≠  Through which the moist force of the loud-voic‚Äôd wind
‚Ä≠  Did never beat, nor ever Ph≈ìbus shin‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Nor show‚Äôr beat through, they grew so one in one,
‚Ä≠  And had, by turns, their pow‚Äôr t‚Äô exclude the sun.
‚Ä≠  Here enter‚Äôd our Ulysses; and a bed
‚Ä≠  Of leaves huge, and of huge abundance, spread
‚Ä≠  With all his speed.  Large he made it, for there
‚Ä≠  For two or three men ample cov‚Äôrings were,
‚Ä≠  Such as might shield them from the winter‚Äôs worst,
‚Ä≠  Though steel it breathed, and blew as it would burst.  [6]
‚Ä≠     Patient Ulysses joy‚Äôd, that ever day
‚Ä≠  Show‚Äôd such a shelter.  In the midst he lay,
‚Ä≠  Store of leaves heaping high on ev‚Äôry side.
‚Ä≠  And as in some out-field a man doth hide
‚Ä≠  A kindled brand, to keep the seed of fire,
‚Ä≠  No neighbour dwelling near, and his desire
‚Ä≠  Serv‚Äôd with self store, he else would ask of none,
‚Ä≠  But of his fore-spent sparks rakes th‚Äô ashes on;
‚Ä≠  So this out-place Ulysses thus receives,
‚Ä≠  And thus nak‚Äôd virtue‚Äôs seed lies hid in leaves.
‚Ä≠  Yet Pallas made him sleep as soon as men
‚Ä≠  Whom delicacies all their flatt‚Äôries deign,
‚Ä≠  And all that all his labours could comprise
‚Ä≠  Quickly concluded in his closed eyes.

‚Ä≠  THE SIXTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Minerva in a vision stands
‚Ä≠  Before Nausicaa:  and commands
‚Ä≠  She to the flood her weeds should bear;
‚Ä≠  For now her nuptial day was near.
‚Ä≠  Nausicaa her charge obeys,
‚Ä≠  And then with other virgins plays.
‚Ä≠  Their sports make wak‚Äôd Ulysses rise;
‚Ä≠  Walk to them, and beseech supplies
‚Ä≠  Of food and clothes.  His naked sight
‚Ä≠  Puts th‚Äô other maids, afraid, to flight;
‚Ä≠  Nausicaa only boldly stays,
‚Ä≠  And gladly his desire obeys.
‚Ä≠  He, furnish‚Äôd with her favour‚Äôs shown,
‚Ä≠  Attends her and the rest to town.

‚Ä≠  _ŒñŒ∑ÃëœÑŒ±._
‚Ä≠     Here olive leaves
‚Ä≠        T‚Äô hide shame began,
‚Ä≠     The maid receives
‚Ä≠        The naked man.

‚Ä≠  The much-sustaining, patient, heav‚Äônly man,
‚Ä≠  Whom Toil and Sleep had worn so weak and wan,  [1]
‚Ä≠  Thus won his rest.  In mean space Pallas went
‚Ä≠  To the Ph√¶acian city, and descent
‚Ä≠  That first did broad Hyperia‚Äôs lands divide,
‚Ä≠  Near the vast Cyclops, men of monstrous pride,
‚Ä≠  That prey‚Äôd on those Hyperians, since they were
‚Ä≠  Of greater pow‚Äôr; and therefore longer there
‚Ä≠  Divine Nausithous dwelt not, but arose,
‚Ä≠  And did for Scheria all his pow‚Äôrs dispose;
‚Ä≠  Far from ingenious art-inventing men
‚Ä≠  But there did he erect a city then,
‚Ä≠  First drew a wall round, then he houses builds,
‚Ä≠  And then a temple to the Gods, the fields
‚Ä≠  Lastly dividing.  But he, stoop‚Äôd by Fate,
‚Ä≠  Div‚Äôd to th‚Äô infernals; and Alcinous sate
‚Ä≠  In his command, a man the Gods did teach
‚Ä≠  Commanding counsels.  His house held the reach
‚Ä≠  Of grey Minerva‚Äôs project, to provide
‚Ä≠  That great-soul‚Äôd Ithacus might be supplied
‚Ä≠  With all things fitting his return.  She went
‚Ä≠  Up to the chamber, where the fair descent
‚Ä≠  Of great Alcinous slept; a maid, whose parts
‚Ä≠  In wit and beauty wore divine deserts.
‚Ä≠  Well-deck‚Äôd her chamber was; of which the door
‚Ä≠  Did seem to lighten, such a gloss it bore
‚Ä≠  Betwixt the posts, and now flew ope to find
‚Ä≠  The Goddess entry.  Like a puft of wind
‚Ä≠  She reach‚Äôd the virgin bed; neat which there lay
‚Ä≠  Two maids, to whom the Graces did convey
‚Ä≠  Figure and manners.  But above the head
‚Ä≠  Of bright Nausicaa did Pallas tread
‚Ä≠  The subtle air, and put the person on
‚Ä≠  Of Dymas‚Äô daughter, from comparison
‚Ä≠  Exempt in business naval.  Like his seed
‚Ä≠  Minerva look‚Äôd now; whom one year did breed  [2]
‚Ä≠  With bright Nausicaa, and who had gain‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Grace in her love, yet on her thus complain‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúNausicaa!  Why bred thy mother one
‚Ä≠  So negligent in rites so stood upon
‚Ä≠  By other virgins?  Thy fair garments lie
‚Ä≠  Neglected by thee, yet thy nuptials nigh;
‚Ä≠  When rich in all attire both thou shouldst be,
‚Ä≠  And garments give to others honouring thee,
‚Ä≠  That lead thee to the temple.  Thy good name
‚Ä≠  Grows amongst men for these things; they inflame
‚Ä≠  Father and rev‚Äôrend mother with delight.
‚Ä≠  Come, when the Day takes any wink from Night,
‚Ä≠  Let‚Äôs to the river, and repurify
‚Ä≠  Thy wedding garments.  My society
‚Ä≠  Shall freely serve thee for thy speedier aid,
‚Ä≠  Because thou shalt no mote stand on the maid.
‚Ä≠  The best of all Ph√¶acia woo thy grace,
‚Ä≠  Where thou wert bred, and ow‚Äôst thyself a race.
‚Ä≠  Up, and stir up to thee thy honour‚Äôd sire,
‚Ä≠  To give thee mules and coach, thee and thy tire,
‚Ä≠  Veils, girdles, mantles, early to the flood
‚Ä≠  To bear in state.  It suits thy high-born blood,
‚Ä≠  And far more fits thee, than to foot so far,
‚Ä≠  For far from town thou know‚Äôst the bath-founts are.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, away blue-eyed Minerva went
‚Ä≠  Up to Olympus, the firm continent
‚Ä≠  That bears in endless being the Deified kind,
‚Ä≠  That‚Äôs neither sous‚Äôd with show‚Äôrs, nor shook with wind,
‚Ä≠  Nor chill‚Äôd with snow, but where Serenity flies
‚Ä≠  Exempt from clouds, and ever-beamy skies
‚Ä≠  Circle the glitt‚Äôring hill, and all their days
‚Ä≠  Give the delights of bless√©d Deity praise.
‚Ä≠  And hither Pallas flew, and left the maid,
‚Ä≠  When she had all that might excite her said.
‚Ä≠  Straight rose the lovely Morn, that up did raise
‚Ä≠  Fair-veil‚Äôd Nausicaa, whose dream her praise
‚Ä≠  To admiration took; who no time spent
‚Ä≠  To give the rapture of her vision vent
‚Ä≠  To her lov‚Äôd parents, whom she found within.
‚Ä≠  Her mother set at fire, who had to spin
‚Ä≠  A rock, whose tincture with sea-purple shin‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  Her maids about her.  But she chanc‚Äôd to find
‚Ä≠  Her father going abroad, to council call‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By his grave Senate.  And to him exhal‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Her smother‚Äôd bosom was:  ‚ÄúLov‚Äôd sire,‚Äù  said she,  [3]
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúWill you not now command a coach for me,
‚Ä≠  Stately and c√≥mplete, fit for me to bear
‚Ä≠  To wash at flood the weeds I cannot wear
‚Ä≠  Before repurified?  Yourself it fits
‚Ä≠  To wear fair weeds, as ev‚Äôry man that sits
‚Ä≠  In place of council.  And five sons you have,
‚Ä≠  Two wed, three bachelors, that must be brave
‚Ä≠  In ev‚Äôry day‚Äôs shift, that they may go dance;
‚Ä≠  For these three last with these things must advance
‚Ä≠  Their states in marriage, and who else but I,
‚Ä≠  Their sister, should their dancing rites supply?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This gen‚Äôral cause she show‚Äôd, and would not name
‚Ä≠  Her mind of nuptials to her sire, for shame.
‚Ä≠  He understood her yet, and thus replied:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúDaughter!  nor these, nor any grace beside,
‚Ä≠  I either will deny thee, or defer,
‚Ä≠  Mules, nor a coach, of state and circular,
‚Ä≠  Fitting at all parts.  Go, my servants shall
‚Ä≠  Serves thy desires, and thy command in all.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The servants then commanded soon obey‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Fetch‚Äôd coach, and mules join‚Äôd in it.  Then the Maid
‚Ä≠  Brought from the chamber her rich weeds, and laid
‚Ä≠  All up in coach; in which her mother plac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A maund of victuals, varied well in taste,
‚Ä≠  And other junkets.  Wine she likewise fill‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Within a goat-skin bottle, and distill‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Sweet and moist oil into a golden cruse,
‚Ä≠  Both for her daughter‚Äôs, and her handmaid‚Äôs, use,
‚Ä≠  To soften their bright bodies, when they rose
‚Ä≠  Cleans‚Äôd from their cold baths.  Up to coach then goes
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô observ√©d Maid, takes both the scourge and reins,
‚Ä≠  And to her side her handmaid straight attains.
‚Ä≠  Nor these alone, but other virgins, grac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The nuptial chariot.  The whole bevy plac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Nausicaa scourg‚Äôd to make the coach-mules run,
‚Ä≠  That neigh‚Äôd, and pac‚Äôd their usual speed, and soon
‚Ä≠  Both maids and weeds brought to the river-side,
‚Ä≠  Where baths for all the year their use supplied,
‚Ä≠  Whose waters were so pure they would not stain,
‚Ä≠  But still ran fair forth, and did more remain
‚Ä≠  Apt to purge stains, for that purg‚Äôd stain within,
‚Ä≠  Which by the water‚Äôs pure store was not seen.
‚Ä≠     These, here arriv‚Äôd, the mules uncoach‚Äôd, and drave
‚Ä≠  Up to the gulfy river‚Äôs shore, that gave
‚Ä≠  Sweet grass to them.  The maids from coach then took
‚Ä≠  Their clothes, and steep‚Äôd them in the sable brook:
‚Ä≠  Then put them into springs, and trod them clean
‚Ä≠  With cleanly feet; adventuring wagers then
‚Ä≠  Who should have soonest and most cleanly done.
‚Ä≠  When having thoroughly cleans‚Äôd, they spread them on
‚Ä≠  The flood‚Äôs shore, all in order.  And then, where
‚Ä≠  The waves the pebbles wash‚Äôd, and ground was clear,
‚Ä≠  They bath‚Äôd themselves, and all with glitt‚Äôring oil
‚Ä≠  Smooth‚Äôd their white skins; refreshing then their toil
‚Ä≠  With pleasant dinner, by the river-side;
‚Ä≠  Yet still watch‚Äôd when the sun their clothes had dried.
‚Ä≠  Till which time, having din‚Äôd, Nausicaa
‚Ä≠  With other virgins did at stool-ball play,
‚Ä≠  Their shoulder-reaching head-tires laying by.
‚Ä≠  Nausicaa, with the wrists of ivory,
‚Ä≠  The liking stroke struck, singing first a song,
‚Ä≠  As custom order‚Äôd, and amidst the throng
‚Ä≠  Made such a show, and so past all was seen,
‚Ä≠  As when the chaste-born, arrow-loving, Queen,
‚Ä≠  Along the mountains gliding, either over
‚Ä≠  Spartan Taygetus, whose tops far discover,
‚Ä≠  Or Eurymanthus, in the wild boar‚Äôs chace,
‚Ä≠  Or swift-hov‚Äôd hart, and with her Jove‚Äôs fair race,
‚Ä≠  The field Nymphs, sporting; amongst whom, to see
‚Ä≠  How far Diana had priority,
‚Ä≠  Though all were fair, for fairness yet of all,
‚Ä≠  As both by head and forehead being more tall,
‚Ä≠  Latona triumph‚Äôd, since the dullest sight
‚Ä≠  Might eas‚Äôly judge whom her pains brought to light;
‚Ä≠  Nausicaa so, whom never husband tam‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Above them all in all the beauties flam‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  But when they now made homewards, and array‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Ord‚Äôring their weeds disorder‚Äôd as they play‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Mules and coach ready, then Minerva thought
‚Ä≠  What means to wake Ulysses might be wrought,
‚Ä≠  That he might see this lovely-sighted maid,
‚Ä≠  Whom she intended should become his aid,
‚Ä≠  Bring him to town, and his return advance.
‚Ä≠  Her mean was this, though thought a stool-ball chance:  [4]
‚Ä≠  The queen now, for the upstroke, struck the ball
‚Ä≠  Quite wide off th‚Äô other maids, and made it fall
‚Ä≠  Amidst the whirlpools.  At which out shriek‚Äôd all,
‚Ä≠  And with the shriek did wise Ulysses wake;
‚Ä≠  Who, sitting up, was doubtful who should make
‚Ä≠  That sudden outcry, and in mind thus striv‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúOn what a people am I now arriv‚Äôd?
‚Ä≠  At civil hospitable men, that fear
‚Ä≠  The Gods?  Or dwell injurious mortals here?
‚Ä≠  Unjust, and churlish?  Like the female cry
‚Ä≠  Of youth it sounds.  What are they?  Nymphs bred high
‚Ä≠  On tops of hills, or in the founts of floods,
‚Ä≠  In herby marshes, or in leafy woods?
‚Ä≠  Or are they high-spoke men I now am near?
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll prove, and see.‚Äù  With this, the wary peer
‚Ä≠  Crept forth the thicket, and an olive bough
‚Ä≠  Broke with his broad hand, which he did bestow
‚Ä≠  In covert of his nakedness, and then
‚Ä≠  Put hasty head out.  Look how from his den
‚Ä≠  A mountain lion looks, that, all embrued
‚Ä≠  With drops of trees, and weather-beaten-hued,
‚Ä≠  Bold of his strength, goes on, and in his eye
‚Ä≠  A burning furnace glows, all bent to prey
‚Ä≠  On sheep, or oxen, or the upland hart,
‚Ä≠  His belly charging him, and he must part
‚Ä≠  Stakes with the herdsman in his beasts‚Äô attempt,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn where from rape their strengths are most exempt;
‚Ä≠  So wet, so weather-beat, so stung with need,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn to the home-fields of the country‚Äôs breed
‚Ä≠  Ulysses was to force forth his access,
‚Ä≠  Though merely naked; and his sight did press
‚Ä≠  The eyes of soft-hair‚Äôd virgins.  Horrid was
‚Ä≠  His rough appearance to them; the hard pass
‚Ä≠  He had at sea stuck by him.  All in flight
‚Ä≠  The virgins scatter‚Äôd, frighted with this sight,
‚Ä≠  About the prominent windings of the flood.
‚Ä≠  All but Nausicaa fled; but she fast stood,
‚Ä≠  Pallas had put a boldness in her breast,
‚Ä≠  And in her fair limbs tender fear comprest.
‚Ä≠  And still she stood him, as resolv‚Äôd to know
‚Ä≠  What man he was, or out of what should grow
‚Ä≠  His strange repair to them.  And here was he
‚Ä≠  Put to his wisdom; if her virgin knee
‚Ä≠  He should be bold, but kneeling, to embrace,
‚Ä≠  Or keep aloof, and try with words of grace,
‚Ä≠  In humblest suppliance, if he might obtain
‚Ä≠  Some cover for his nakedness, and gain
‚Ä≠  Her grace to show and guide him to the town.
‚Ä≠  The last he best thought, to be worth his own,
‚Ä≠  In weighing both well; to keep still aloof,
‚Ä≠  And give with soft words his desires their proof,
‚Ä≠  Lest, pressing so near as to touch her knee,
‚Ä≠  He might incense her maiden modesty.
‚Ä≠  This fair and fil‚Äôd speech then shew‚Äôd this was he:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúLet me beseech, O queen, this truth of thee,
‚Ä≠  Are you of mortal, or the defied, race?
‚Ä≠  If of the Gods, that th‚Äô ample heav‚Äôns embrace,
‚Ä≠  I can resemble you to none above
‚Ä≠  So near as to the chaste-born birth of Jove,
‚Ä≠  The beamy Cynthia.  Her you full present,
‚Ä≠  In grace of ev‚Äôry God-like lineament,
‚Ä≠  Her goodly magnitude, and all th‚Äô address
‚Ä≠  You promise of her very perfectness.
‚Ä≠  If sprung of humans, that inhabit earth,
‚Ä≠  Thrice blest are both the authors of your birth,
‚Ä≠  Thrice blest your brothers, that in your deserts
‚Ä≠  Must, ev‚Äôn to rapture, bear delighted hearts,
‚Ä≠  To see, so like the first trim of a tree,
‚Ä≠  Your form adorn a dance.  But most blest he,
‚Ä≠  Of all that breathe, that hath the gift t‚Äô engage
‚Ä≠  Your bright neck in the yoke of marriage,
‚Ä≠  And deck his house with your commanding merit
‚Ä≠  I have not seen a man of so much spirit,
‚Ä≠  Nor man, nor woman, I did ever see,
‚Ä≠  At all parts equal to the parts in thee.
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô enjoy your sight, doth admiration seize
‚Ä≠  My eyes, and apprehensive faculties.
‚Ä≠  Lately in Delos (with a charge of men
‚Ä≠  Arriv‚Äôd, that render‚Äôd me most wretched then,
‚Ä≠  Now making me thus naked) I beheld
‚Ä≠  The burthen of a palm, whose issue swell‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  About Apollo‚Äôs fane, and that put on
‚Ä≠  A grace like thee; for Earth had never none
‚Ä≠  Of all her sylvan issue so adorn‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Into amaze my very soul was turn‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  To give it observation; as now thee
‚Ä≠  To view, O virgin, a stupidity
‚Ä≠  Past admiration strikes me, join‚Äôd with fear
‚Ä≠  To do a suppliant‚Äôs due, and press so near,
‚Ä≠  As to embrace thy knees.  Nor is it strange,
‚Ä≠  For one of fresh and firmest spirit would change
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô embrace so bright an object.  But, for me,
‚Ä≠  A cruel habit of calamity
‚Ä≠  Prepar‚Äôd the strong impression thou hast made;
‚Ä≠  For this last day did fly night‚Äôs twentieth shade
‚Ä≠  Since I, at length, escap‚Äôd the sable seas;
‚Ä≠  When in the mean time th‚Äô unrelenting prease
‚Ä≠  Of waves and stern storms toss‚Äôd me up and down,
‚Ä≠  From th‚Äô isle Ogygia.  And now God hath thrown
‚Ä≠  My wrack on this shore, that perhaps I may
‚Ä≠  My mis‚Äôries vary here; for yet their stay,
‚Ä≠  I fear, Heav‚Äôn hath not order‚Äôd, though, before
‚Ä≠  These late afflictions, it hath lent me store.
‚Ä≠  O queen, deign pity then, since first to you
‚Ä≠  My fate importunes my distress to vow.
‚Ä≠  No other dame, nor man, that this Earth own,
‚Ä≠  And neighbour city, I have seen or known.
‚Ä≠  The town then show me; give my nakedness
‚Ä≠  Some shroud to shelter it, if to these seas
‚Ä≠  Linen or woollen you have brought to cleanse.
‚Ä≠  God give you, in requital, all th‚Äô amends
‚Ä≠  Your heart can wish, a husband, family,
‚Ä≠  And good agreement.  Nought beneath the sky
‚Ä≠  More sweet, more worthy is, than firm consent
‚Ä≠  Of man and wife in household government.
‚Ä≠  It joys their wishers-well, their enemies wounds,
‚Ä≠  But to themselves the special good redounds.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúStranger!  I discern in thee
‚Ä≠  Nor sloth, nor folly, reigns; and yet I see
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô art poor and wretched.  In which I conclude,
‚Ä≠  That industry nor wisdom make endued
‚Ä≠  Men with those gifts that make them best to th‚Äô eye;
‚Ä≠  Jove only orders man‚Äôs felicity.
‚Ä≠  To good and bad his pleasure fashions still
‚Ä≠  The whole proportion of their good and ill.
‚Ä≠  And he, perhaps, hath form‚Äôd this plight in thee,
‚Ä≠  Of which thou must be patient, as he free.
‚Ä≠  But after all thy wand‚Äôrings, since thy way,
‚Ä≠  Both to our earth, and near our city, lay,
‚Ä≠  As being expos‚Äôd to our cares to relieve,
‚Ä≠  Weeds, and what else a human hand should give
‚Ä≠  To one so suppliant and tam‚Äôd with woe,
‚Ä≠  Thou shalt not want.  Our city I will show,
‚Ä≠  And tell our people‚Äôs name:  This neighbour town,
‚Ä≠  And all this kingdom, the Ph√¶acians own.
‚Ä≠  And (since thou seem‚Äôdst so fain to know my birth,
‚Ä≠  And mad‚Äôst a question, if of heav‚Äôn or earth.)
‚Ä≠  This earth hath bred me; and my father‚Äôs name
‚Ä≠  Alcinous is, that in the pow‚Äôr and frame
‚Ä≠  Of this isle‚Äôs rule is supereminent.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus, passing him, she to the virgins went,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúGive stay both to your feet and fright.
‚Ä≠  Why thus disperse ye for a man‚Äôs mere sight?
‚Ä≠  Esteem you him a Cyclop, that long since
‚Ä≠  Made use to prey upon our citizens?
‚Ä≠  This man no moist man is, (nor wat‚Äôrish thing,  [5]
‚Ä≠  That‚Äôs ever flitting, ever ravishing
‚Ä≠  All it can compass; and, like it, doth range
‚Ä≠  In rape of women, never stay‚Äôd in change).
‚Ä≠  This man is truly manly, wise, and stay‚Äôd,  [6]
‚Ä≠  In soul more rich the more to sense decay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Who nor will do, nor suffer to be done,
‚Ä≠  Acts lewd and abject; nor can such a one
‚Ä≠  Greet the Ph√¶acians with a mind env√≠ous,
‚Ä≠  Dear to the Gods they are, and he is pious,
‚Ä≠  Besides, divided from the world we are,
‚Ä≠  The out-part of it, billows circular
‚Ä≠  The sea revolving round about our shore;
‚Ä≠  Nor is there any man that enters more
‚Ä≠  Than our own countrymen, with what is brought
‚Ä≠  From other countries.  This man, minding nought
‚Ä≠  But his relief, a poor unhappy wretch,
‚Ä≠  Wrack‚Äôd here, and hath no other land to fetch,
‚Ä≠  Him now we must provide for.  From Jove come  [7]
‚Ä≠  All strangers, and the needy of a home,
‚Ä≠  Who any gift, though ne‚Äôer so small it be,
‚Ä≠  Esteem as great, and take it gratefully.
‚Ä≠  And therefore, virgins, give the stranger food,
‚Ä≠  And wine; and see ye bathe him in the flood,
‚Ä≠  Near to some shore to shelter most inclin‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  _To cold-bath-bathers hurtful is the wind,_
‚Ä≠  Not only rugged making th‚Äô outward skin,
‚Ä≠  But by his thin pow‚Äôrs pierceth parts within.
‚Ä≠     This said, their flight in a return they set,
‚Ä≠  And did Ulysses with all grace entreat,
‚Ä≠  Show‚Äôd him a shore, wind-proof, and full of shade,
‚Ä≠  By him a shirt and utter mantle laid,
‚Ä≠  A golden jug of liquid oil did add,
‚Ä≠  Bad wash, and all things as Nausicaa bad.
‚Ä≠     Divine Ulysses would not use their aid;
‚Ä≠  But thus bespake them:  ‚ÄúEv‚Äôry lovely maid,
‚Ä≠  Let me entreat to stand a little by,  [8]
‚Ä≠  That I, alone, the fresh flood may apply
‚Ä≠  To cleanse my bosom of the sea-wrought brine,
‚Ä≠  And then use oil, which long time did not shine
‚Ä≠  On my poor shoulders.  I‚Äôll not wash in sight
‚Ä≠  Of fair-hair‚Äôd maidens.  I should blush outright,
‚Ä≠  To bathe all-bare by such a virgin light.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     They mov‚Äôd, and mus‚Äôd a man had so much grace,
‚Ä≠  And told their mistress what a man he was.
‚Ä≠     He cleans‚Äôd his broad soil‚Äôd shoulders, back, and head
‚Ä≠  Yet never tam‚Äôd, but now had foam and weed
‚Ä≠  Knit in the fair curls.  Which dissolv‚Äôd, and he
‚Ä≠  Slick‚Äôd all with sweet oil, the sweet charity
‚Ä≠  The untouch‚Äôd virgin show‚Äôd in his attire
‚Ä≠  He cloth‚Äôd him with.  Then Pallas put a fire,
‚Ä≠  More than before, into his sparkling eyes,
‚Ä≠  His late soil set off with his soon fresh guise.
‚Ä≠  His locks, cleans‚Äôd, curl‚Äôd the more, and match‚Äôd, in pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  To please an eye, the hyacinthian flow‚Äôr.
‚Ä≠  And as a workman, that can well combine
‚Ä≠  Silver and gold, and make both strive to shine,
‚Ä≠  As being by Vulcan, and Minerva too,
‚Ä≠  Taught how far either may be urg‚Äôd to go
‚Ä≠  In strife of eminence, when work sets forth
‚Ä≠  A worthy soul to bodies of such worth,
‚Ä≠  No thought reproving th‚Äô act, in any place,
‚Ä≠  Nor Art no debt to Nature‚Äôs liveliest grace;
‚Ä≠  So Pallas wrought in him a grace as great
‚Ä≠  From head to shoulders, and ashore did seat
‚Ä≠  His goodly presence.  To which such a guise
‚Ä≠  He show‚Äôd in going, that it ravish‚Äôd eyes.
‚Ä≠  All which continued, as he sat apart,
‚Ä≠  Nausicaa‚Äôs eye struck wonder through her heart,
‚Ä≠  Who thus bespake her consorts:  ‚ÄúHear me, you
‚Ä≠  Fair-wristed virgins!  This rare man, I know,
‚Ä≠  Treads not our country-earth, against the will
‚Ä≠  Of some God thron√©d on th‚Äô Olympian hill.
‚Ä≠  He show‚Äôd to me, till now, not worth the note,
‚Ä≠  But now he looks as he had godhead got.
‚Ä≠  I would to heav‚Äôn my husband were no worse,
‚Ä≠  And would be call‚Äôd no better, but the course
‚Ä≠  Of other husbands pleas‚Äôd to dwell out here.
‚Ä≠  Observe and serve him with our utmost cheer.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She said, they heard and did.  He drunk and eat
‚Ä≠  Like to a harpy, having touch‚Äôd no meat
‚Ä≠  A long before time.  But Nausicaa now
‚Ä≠  Thought of the more grace she did lately vow,
‚Ä≠  Had horse to chariot join‚Äôd, and up she rose,
‚Ä≠  Up cheer‚Äôd her guest, and said:  ‚ÄúGuest, now dispose
‚Ä≠  Yourself for town, that I may let you see
‚Ä≠  My father‚Äôs court, where all the peers will be
‚Ä≠  Of our Ph√¶acian state.  At all parts, then,
‚Ä≠  Observe to whom and what place y‚Äô are t‚Äô attain;
‚Ä≠  Though I need usher you with no advice,
‚Ä≠  Since I suppose you absolutely wise.
‚Ä≠  While we the fields pass, and men‚Äôs labours there,
‚Ä≠  So long, in these maids‚Äô guides, directly bear
‚Ä≠  Upon my chariot (I must go before
‚Ä≠  For cause that after comes, to which this more
‚Ä≠  Be my induction) you shall then soon end
‚Ä≠  Your way to town, whose tow‚Äôrs you see ascend  [9]
‚Ä≠  To such a steepness.  On whose either side
‚Ä≠  A fair port stands, to which is nothing wide
‚Ä≠  An ent‚Äôrer‚Äôs passage; on whose both hands ride
‚Ä≠  Ships in fair harbours; which once past, you win
‚Ä≠  The goodly market-place (that circles in
‚Ä≠  A fane to Neptune, built of curious stone,
‚Ä≠  And passing ample) where muniti√≥n,
‚Ä≠  Gables, and masts, men make, and polish‚Äôd oars;
‚Ä≠  For the Ph√¶acians are not conquerors
‚Ä≠  By bows nor quivers; oars, masts, ships they are
‚Ä≠  With which they plough the sea, and wage their war.
‚Ä≠  And now the cause comes why I lead the way,
‚Ä≠  Not taking you to coach:  The men, that sway
‚Ä≠  In work of those tools that so fit our state,
‚Ä≠  Are rude mechanicals, that rare and late
‚Ä≠  Work in the market-place; and those are they
‚Ä≠  Whose bitter tongues I shun, who straight would say
‚Ä≠  (For these vile vulgars are extremely proud,
‚Ä≠  And foully-languag‚Äôd)  ‚ÄòWhat is he, allow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To coach it with Nausicaa, so large set,
‚Ä≠  And fairly fashion‚Äôd?  Where were these two met?
‚Ä≠  He shall be sure her husband.  She hath been
‚Ä≠  Gadding in some place, and, of foreign men
‚Ä≠  Fitting her fancy, kindly brought him home
‚Ä≠  In her own ship.  He must, of force, be come
‚Ä≠  From some far region; we have no such man.
‚Ä≠  It may be, praying hard, when her heart ran
‚Ä≠  On some wish‚Äôd husband, out of heav‚Äôn some God
‚Ä≠  Dropp‚Äôd in her lap; and there lies she at road
‚Ä≠  Her c√≥mplete life time.  But, in sooth, if she,
‚Ä≠  Ranging abroad, a husband, such as he
‚Ä≠  Whom now we saw, laid hand on, she was wise,
‚Ä≠  For none of all our nobles are of prize
‚Ä≠  Enough for her; he must beyond sea come,
‚Ä≠  That wins her high mind, and will have her home.
‚Ä≠  Of our peers many have importun‚Äôd her,
‚Ä≠  Yet she will none.‚Äô  Thus these folks will confer
‚Ä≠  Behind my back; or, meeting, to my face
‚Ä≠  The foul-mouth rout dare put home this disgrace;
‚Ä≠  And this would be reproaches to my fame,
‚Ä≠  For, ev‚Äôn myself just anger would inflame,
‚Ä≠  If any other virgin I should see,
‚Ä≠  Her parents living, keep the company
‚Ä≠  Of any man to any end of love,
‚Ä≠  Till open nuptials should her act approve.
‚Ä≠  And therefore hear me, guest, and take such way,
‚Ä≠  That you yourself may compass, in your stay,
‚Ä≠  Your quick deduction by my father‚Äôs grace,
‚Ä≠  And means to reach the root of all your race.
‚Ä≠     We shall, not far out of our way to town,
‚Ä≠  A never-fell‚Äôd grove find, that poplars crown,
‚Ä≠  To Pallas sacred, where a fountain flows,
‚Ä≠  And round about the grove a meadow grows,
‚Ä≠  In which my father holds a manor-house,
‚Ä≠  Deck‚Äôd all with orchards, green, and odorous,
‚Ä≠  As far from town as one may hear a shout.
‚Ä≠  There stay, and rest your foot-pains, till full out
‚Ä≠  We reach the city; where, when you may guess
‚Ä≠  We are arriv‚Äôd, and enter our access
‚Ä≠  Within my father‚Äôs court, then put you on
‚Ä≠  For our Ph√¶acian state, where, to be shown
‚Ä≠  My father‚Äôs house, desire.  Each infant there
‚Ä≠  Can bring you to it; and yourself will clear
‚Ä≠  Distinguish it from others, for no shows
‚Ä≠  The city-buildings make compar‚Äôd with those
‚Ä≠  That king Alcinous‚Äô seat doth celebrate.
‚Ä≠  In whose roofs, and the court (where men of state,
‚Ä≠  And suitors sit and stay) when you shall hide,
‚Ä≠  Straight pass it, ent‚Äôring further, where abide
‚Ä≠  My mother, with her withdrawn housewif‚Äôries,
‚Ä≠  Who still sits in the fire-shine, and applies
‚Ä≠  Her rock, all-purple, and of pompous show,
‚Ä≠  Her chair plac‚Äôd ‚Äôgainst a pillar, all-a-row
‚Ä≠  Her maids behind her set; and to her here
‚Ä≠  My father‚Äôs dining-throne looks, seated where
‚Ä≠  He pours his choice of wine in, like a God.
‚Ä≠  This view once past, for th‚Äô end of your abode,
‚Ä≠  Address suit to my mother, that her mean
‚Ä≠  May make the day of your redition seen,
‚Ä≠  And you may frolic straight, though far away
‚Ä≠  You are in distance from your wish√©d stay.
‚Ä≠  For, if she once be won to wish you well,
‚Ä≠  Your hope may instantly your passport seal,
‚Ä≠  And thenceforth sure abide to see your friends,
‚Ä≠  Fair house, and all to which your heart contends.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, she us‚Äôd her shining scourge, and lash‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Her mules, that soon the shore left where she wash‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And, knowing well the way, their pace was fleet,
‚Ä≠  And thick they gather‚Äôd up their nimble feet.
‚Ä≠  Which yet she temper‚Äôd so, and us‚Äôd her scourge  [10]
‚Ä≠  With so much skill, as not to over-urge
‚Ä≠  The foot behind, and make them straggle so
‚Ä≠  From close society.  Firm together go
‚Ä≠  Ulysses and her maids.  And now the sun
‚Ä≠  Sunk to the waters, when they all had won
‚Ä≠  The never-fell‚Äôd, and sound-exciting, wood,
‚Ä≠  Sacred to Pallas; where the god-like good
‚Ä≠  Ulysses rested, and to Pallas pray‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHear me, of goat-kept Jove th‚Äô unconquer‚Äôd Maid!  [11]
‚Ä≠  Now throughly hear me, since, in all the time
‚Ä≠  Of all my wrack, my pray‚Äôrs could never climb
‚Ä≠  Thy far-off ears; when noiseful Neptune toss‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Upon his wat‚Äôry bristles my emboss‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  And rock-torn body.  Hear yet now, and deign
‚Ä≠  I may of the Ph√¶acian state obtain
‚Ä≠  Pity, and grace.‚Äù  Thus pray‚Äôd he, and she heard,
‚Ä≠  By no means yet, expos‚Äôd to sight, appear‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  For fear t‚Äô offend her uncle, the supreme
‚Ä≠  Of all the Sea-Gods, whose wrath still extreme
‚Ä≠  Stood to Ulysses; and would never cease,
‚Ä≠  Till with his country shore he crown‚Äôd his peace.

‚Ä≠[2] Intending Dymas‚Äô daughter.

‚Ä≠[3] This familiar and near wanton carriage of Nausicaa to her father,
‚Ä≠joined with that virgin modesty expressed in her after, is much
‚Ä≠praised by the gravest of Homer‚Äôs expositors; with her father‚Äôs
‚Ä≠loving allowance of it, knowing her shamefastness and judgment
‚Ä≠would not let her exceed at any part.  Which note is here inserted,
‚Ä≠not as if this were more worthy the observation than other
‚Ä≠every-where strewed flowers of precept, but because this more
‚Ä≠generally pleasing subject may perhaps find more fitness for the
‚Ä≠stay of most readers.

‚Ä≠[4] The piety and wisdom of the Poet was such, that (agreeing with
‚Ä≠the Sacred Letter) not the least of things he makes come to pass
‚Ä≠_sine Numinis providenti√¢._  As Spondanus well notes of him.

‚Ä≠[5] _ŒîŒπŒµœÅ·Ω∏œÇ Œ≤œÅŒøœÑ·ΩπœÇ.  Cui vitalis vel sensualis humiditas inest.
‚Ä≠Œ≤œÅŒøœÑ·Ω∏œÇ ·Ω∞ ·ø•·Ω≥œâ, ut dicatur quasi ·ø•ŒøœÑ·Ω∏œÇ,_ i.e.  _·ΩÅ ·ºêŒΩ ·ø•Œø·æì ·Ω¢ŒΩ, quod
‚Ä≠nihil sit magis fluxum quam homo._

‚Ä≠[6]  _ŒëŒΩ·ΩµœÅ virili animo pr√¶ditus, fortis, magnanimus._  Nor are
‚Ä≠those affirmed to be men, _qui servile quidpiam et abjectum
‚Ä≠faciunt, vel, facere sustinent_:  according to this of Herodotus in
‚Ä≠Polym. _œÄŒøŒªŒªŒø·Ω∂ Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøŒπ ŒµŒπÕíŒµŒΩ, ·ΩÄŒª·Ω∑Œ≥ŒøŒπ Œ¥·Ω≤ ·ºÑŒΩŒ¥œÅŒµœÇ._  Many
‚Ä≠men‚Äôs forms sustain, but few are men.

‚Ä≠[7] According to another translator:
‚Ä≠     _‚ÄúAb Jove nam supplex pauper procedit et hospes,
‚Ä≠     Res brevis, at chara est, magni quoque munaris instar.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠Which I cite to show his good when he keeps him to the original,
‚Ä≠and near in any degree expounds it.

‚Ä≠[8] He taught their youths modesty by his aged judgment.  As
‚Ä≠receiving the custom of maids then used to that entertainment of
‚Ä≠men, notwithstanding the modesty of that age, could not be
‚Ä≠corrupted inwardly for those outward kind observations of guests
‚Ä≠and strangers, and was therefore privileged.  It is easy to avoid
‚Ä≠show; and those, that most curiously avoid the outward
‚Ä≠construction, are ever most tainted with the inward corruption.

‚Ä≠[9] The city‚Äôs description so far forth as may in part induce her
‚Ä≠promised reason why she took not Ulysses to coach with her.

‚Ä≠[10] Not without some little note of our omnisufficient Homer‚Äôs
‚Ä≠general touch of the least fitness lying in his way, may this courtly
‚Ä≠discretion he describes in Nausicaa be observed, if you please.

‚Ä≠[11] More of our Poet‚Äôs curious and sweet piety.



‚Ä≠  THE SEVENTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Nausicaa arrives at town;
‚Ä≠  And then Ulysses.  He makes known
‚Ä≠  His suit to Arete:  who view
‚Ä≠  Takes of his vesture, which she knew,
‚Ä≠  And asks him from whose hands it came.
‚Ä≠  He tells, with all the hapless frame
‚Ä≠  Of his affairs in all the while
‚Ä≠  Since he forsook Calypso‚Äôs isle.
‚Ä≠
‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _ŒóœÑŒ±._
‚Ä≠     The honour‚Äôd minds,
‚Ä≠        And welcome things,
‚Ä≠     Ulysses finds
‚Ä≠        In Scheria‚Äôs kings.

‚Ä≠  Thus pray‚Äôd the wise and God-observing man.
‚Ä≠  The Maid, by free force of her palfreys, wan
‚Ä≠  Access to town, and the renown√©d court
‚Ä≠  Reach‚Äôd of her father; where, within the port,
‚Ä≠  She stay‚Äôd her coach, and round about her came
‚Ä≠  Her brothers, made as of immortal frame,
‚Ä≠  Who yet disdain‚Äôd not, for her love, mean deeds,
‚Ä≠  But took from coach her mules, brought in her weeds.  [1]
‚Ä≠  And she ascends her chamber; where purvey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A quick fire was by her old chamber-maid,
‚Ä≠  Eurymedusa, th‚Äô Aper√¶an born,
‚Ä≠  And brought by sea from Apera t‚Äô adorn
‚Ä≠  The court of great Alcinous, because
‚Ä≠  He gave to all the blest Ph√¶acians laws,
‚Ä≠  And, like a heav‚Äôn-born pow‚Äôr in speech, acquir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The people‚Äôs ears.  To one then so admir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Eurymedusa was esteem‚Äôd no worse
‚Ä≠  Than worth the gift; yet now, grown old, was nurse
‚Ä≠  To ivory-arm‚Äôd Nausicaa, gave heat
‚Ä≠  To all her fires, and dress‚Äôd her privy meat.
‚Ä≠     Then rose Ulysses, and made way to town;
‚Ä≠  Which ere he reach‚Äôd, a mighty mist was thrown
‚Ä≠  By Pallas round about him, in her care,
‚Ä≠  Lest, in the sway of envies popular,
‚Ä≠  Some proud Ph√¶acian might foul language pass,
‚Ä≠  Justle him up, and ask him what he was.
‚Ä≠     Ent‚Äôring the lovely town yet, through the cloud
‚Ä≠  Pallas appear‚Äôd, and like a young wench show‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Bearing a pitcher, stood before him so
‚Ä≠  As if objected purposely to know
‚Ä≠  What there he needed; whom he question‚Äôd thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúKnow you not, daughter, where Alcinous,
‚Ä≠  That rules this town, dwells?  I, a poor distrest
‚Ä≠  Mere stranger here, know none I may request
‚Ä≠  To make this court known to me.‚Äù  She replied:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúStrange father, I will see you satisfied
‚Ä≠  In that request.  My father dwells just by
‚Ä≠  The house you seek for; but go silently,
‚Ä≠  Nor ask, nor speak to any other, I
‚Ä≠  Shall be enough to show your way.  The men
‚Ä≠  That here inhabit do not entertain
‚Ä≠  With ready kindness strangers, of what worth
‚Ä≠  Or state soever, nor have taken forth
‚Ä≠  Lessons of civil usage or respect
‚Ä≠  To men beyond them.  They, upon their pow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  Of swift ships building, top the wat‚Äôry tow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  And Jove hath giv‚Äôn them ships, for sail so wrought,
‚Ä≠  They cut a feather, and command a thought.‚Äù  [2]
‚Ä≠     This said, she usher‚Äôd him, and after he
‚Ä≠  Trod in the swift steps of the Deity.
‚Ä≠  The free-sail‚Äôd seamen could not get a sight
‚Ä≠  Of our Ulysses yet, though he forthright
‚Ä≠  Both by their houses and their persons past,
‚Ä≠  Pallas about him such a darkness cast
‚Ä≠  By her divine pow‚Äôr, and her rev‚Äôrend care,
‚Ä≠  She would not give the town-born cause to stare.
‚Ä≠     He wonder‚Äôd, as he past, to see the ports;
‚Ä≠  The shipping in them; and for all resorts
‚Ä≠  The goodly market-steads; and aisles beside
‚Ä≠  For the hero√´s; walls so large and wide;
‚Ä≠  Rampires so high, and of such strength withall,
‚Ä≠  It would with wonder any eye appall.
‚Ä≠     At last they reach‚Äôd the court, and Pallas said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúNow, honour‚Äôd stranger, I will see obey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Your will, to show our ruler‚Äôs house; ‚Äôtis here;
‚Ä≠  Where you shall find kings celebrating cheer.
‚Ä≠  Enter amongst them, nor admit a fear.
‚Ä≠  _More bold a man is, he prevails the more,
‚Ä≠  Though man nor place lie ever saw before._
‚Ä≠     You first shall find the queen in court, whose name
‚Ä≠  Is Arete, of parents born the same
‚Ä≠  That was the king her spouse; their pedigree  [3]
‚Ä≠  I can report.  The great Earth-shaker, he
‚Ä≠  Of Perib≈ìa (that her sex out-shone,
‚Ä≠  And youngest daughter was t‚Äô Eurymedon,
‚Ä≠  Who of th‚Äô unmeasur‚Äôd-minded giants sway‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô imperial sceptre, and the pride allay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of men so impious with cold death, and died
‚Ä≠  Himself soon after) got the magnified
‚Ä≠  In mind, Nausithous; whom the kingdom‚Äôs state
‚Ä≠  First held in supreme rule.  Nausithous gat
‚Ä≠  Rhexenor, and Alcinous, now king.
‚Ä≠  Rhexenor (whose seed did no male fruit spring,
‚Ä≠  And whom the silver-bow-grac‚Äôd Ph≈ìbus slew
‚Ä≠  Young in the court) his shed blood did renew
‚Ä≠  In only Arete, who now is spouse
‚Ä≠  To him that rules the kingdom in this house,
‚Ä≠  And is her uncle king Alcinous,
‚Ä≠  Who honours her past equal.  She may boast
‚Ä≠  More honour of him than the honour‚Äôd most  [4]
‚Ä≠  Of any wife in earth can of her lord,
‚Ä≠  How many more soever realms afford,
‚Ä≠  That keep house under husbands.  Yet no more
‚Ä≠  Her husband honours her, than her blest store
‚Ä≠  Of gracious children.  All the city cast
‚Ä≠  Eyes on her as a Goddess, and give taste
‚Ä≠  Of their affections to her in their pray‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  Still as she decks the street; for, all affairs
‚Ä≠  Wrapt in contention, she dissolves to men.
‚Ä≠  Whom she affects, she wants no mind to deign
‚Ä≠  Goodness enough.  If her heart stand inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To your dispatch, hope all you wish to find,
‚Ä≠  Your friends, your longing family, and all
‚Ä≠  That can within your most affections fall.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, away the grey-eyed Goddess flew
‚Ä≠  Along th‚Äô untam‚Äôd sea, left the lovely hue
‚Ä≠  Scheria presented, out-flew Marathon,
‚Ä≠  And ample-streeted Athens lighted on;
‚Ä≠  Where to the house, that casts so thick a shade,  [5]
‚Ä≠  Of Erechthe√ºs she ingression made.
‚Ä≠     Ulysses to the lofty-builded court
‚Ä≠  Of king Alcinous made bold resort;
‚Ä≠  Yet in his heart cast many a thought, before
‚Ä≠  The brazen pavement of the rich court bore
‚Ä≠  His enter‚Äôd person.  Like heav‚Äôn‚Äôs two main lights
‚Ä≠  The rooms illustrated both days and nights.
‚Ä≠  On ev‚Äôry side stood firm a wall of brass,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn from the threshold to the inmost pass,
‚Ä≠  Which bore a roof up that all-sapphire was.
‚Ä≠  The brazen thresholds both sides did enfold
‚Ä≠  Silver pilasters, hung with gates of gold;
‚Ä≠  Whose portal was of silver; over which
‚Ä≠  A golden cornice did the front enrich.
‚Ä≠  On each side, dogs, of gold and silver fram‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  The house‚Äôs guard stood:  which the Deity lam‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With knowing inwards had inspir‚Äôd, and made
‚Ä≠  That death nor age should their estates invade.
‚Ä≠     Along the wall stood ev‚Äôry way a throne,
‚Ä≠  From th‚Äô entry to the lobby, ev‚Äôry one
‚Ä≠  Cast over with a rich-wrought cloth of state.
‚Ä≠  Beneath which the Ph√¶acian princes sate
‚Ä≠  At wine and food, and feasted all the year.
‚Ä≠  Youths forg‚Äôd of gold, at ev‚Äôry table there,
‚Ä≠  Stood holding flaming torches, that, in night,
‚Ä≠  Gave through the house each honour‚Äôd guest his light
‚Ä≠     And, to encounter feast with housewif‚Äôry,
‚Ä≠  In one room fifty women did apply
‚Ä≠  Their sev‚Äôral tasks.  Some apple-colour‚Äôd corn
‚Ä≠  Ground in fair querns, and some did spindles turn,
‚Ä≠  Some work in looms; no hand least rest receives,
‚Ä≠  But all had motion apt as aspen leaves.
‚Ä≠  And from the weeds they wove, so fast they laid,
‚Ä≠  And so thick thrust together thread by thread,
‚Ä≠  That th‚Äô oil, of which the wool had drunk his fill,
‚Ä≠  Did with his moisture in light dews distill.
‚Ä≠     As much as the Ph√¶acian men excell‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  All other countrymen in art to build
‚Ä≠  A swift-sail‚Äôd ship; so much the women there
‚Ä≠  For work of webs, past other women were.
‚Ä≠  Past mean, by Pallas‚Äô means, they understood
‚Ä≠  The grace of good works; and had wits as good.
‚Ä≠     Without the hall, and close upon the gate,
‚Ä≠  A goodly orchard-ground was situate,
‚Ä≠  Of near ten acres; about which was led
‚Ä≠  A lofty quickset.  In it flourished
‚Ä≠  High and broad fruit trees, that pomegranates bore,
‚Ä≠  Sweet figs, pears, olives; and a number more
‚Ä≠  Most useful plants did there produce their store,
‚Ä≠  Whose fruits the hardest winter could not kill,
‚Ä≠  Nor hottest summer wither.  There was still
‚Ä≠  Fruit in his proper season all the year.
‚Ä≠  Sweet Zephyr breath‚Äôd upon them blasts that were
‚Ä≠  Of varied tempers.  These he made to bear
‚Ä≠  Ripe fruits, these blossoms.  Pear grew after pear,
‚Ä≠  Apple succeeded apple, grape the grape,
‚Ä≠  Fig after fig came; time made never rape
‚Ä≠  Of any dainty there.  A spritely vine
‚Ä≠  Spread here his root, whose fruit a hot sunshine
‚Ä≠  Made ripe betimes; here grew another green.
‚Ä≠  Here some were gath‚Äôring, here some pressing, seen.
‚Ä≠  A large-allotted sev‚Äôral each fruit had;
‚Ä≠  And all th‚Äô adorn‚Äôd grounds their appearance made
‚Ä≠  In flow‚Äôr and fruit, at which the king did aim
‚Ä≠  To the precisest order he could claim.
‚Ä≠     Two fountains grac‚Äôd the garden; of which, one
‚Ä≠  Pour‚Äôd out a winding stream that over-run
‚Ä≠  The grounds for their use chiefly, th‚Äô other went
‚Ä≠  Close by the lofty palace gate, and lent
‚Ä≠  The city his sweet benefit.  And thus
‚Ä≠  The Gods the court deck‚Äôd of Alcinous.
‚Ä≠     Patient Ulysses stood a while at gaze,
‚Ä≠  But, having all observ‚Äôd, made instant pace
‚Ä≠  Into the court; where all the peers he found,
‚Ä≠  And captains of Ph√¶acia, with cups-crown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Off‚Äôring to sharp-eyed Hermes, to whom last
‚Ä≠  They us‚Äôd to sacrifice, when sleep had cast
‚Ä≠  His inclination through their thoughts.  But these
‚Ä≠  Ulysses pass‚Äôd, and forth went; nor their eyes
‚Ä≠  Took note of him, for Pallas stopp‚Äôd the light
‚Ä≠  With mists about him, that, unstay‚Äôd, he might
‚Ä≠  First to Alcinous, and Arete,
‚Ä≠  Present his person; and, of both them, she,
‚Ä≠  By Pallas‚Äô counsel, was to have the grace
‚Ä≠  Of foremost greeting.  Therefore his embrace
‚Ä≠  He cast about her knee.  And then off flew
‚Ä≠  The heav‚Äônly air that hid him.  When his view
‚Ä≠  With silence and with admiration strook
‚Ä≠  The court quite through; but thus he silence broke:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúDivine Rhexenor‚Äôs offspring, Arete,
‚Ä≠  To thy most honour‚Äôd husband, and to thee,
‚Ä≠  A man whom many labours have distrest
‚Ä≠  Is come for comfort, and to ev‚Äôry guest.
‚Ä≠  To all whom heav‚Äôn vouchsafe delightsome lives,
‚Ä≠  And after to your issue that survives
‚Ä≠  A good resignment of the goods ye leave,
‚Ä≠  With all the honour that yourselves receive
‚Ä≠  Amongst your people.  Only this of me
‚Ä≠  Is the ambition; that I may but see
‚Ä≠  (By your vouchsaf‚Äôd means, and betimes vouchsaf‚Äôd)
‚Ä≠  My country-earth; since I have long been left
‚Ä≠  To labours, and to errors, barr‚Äôd from end,
‚Ä≠  And far from benefit of any friend,‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He said no more, but left them dumb with that,
‚Ä≠  Went to the hearth, and in the ashes sat,
‚Ä≠  Aside the fire.  At last their silence brake,
‚Ä≠  And Echin√´us, th‚Äô old hero√´, spake;
‚Ä≠  A man that all Ph√¶acians pass‚Äôd in years,
‚Ä≠  And in persuasive eloquence all the peers,
‚Ä≠  Knew much, and us‚Äôd it well; and thus spake he:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAlcinous!  It shews not decently,
‚Ä≠  Nor doth your honour what you see admit,
‚Ä≠  That this your guest should thus abjectly sit,
‚Ä≠  His chair the earth, the hearth his cushion,
‚Ä≠  Ashes as if appos‚Äôd for food.  A throne,
‚Ä≠  Adorn‚Äôd with due rites, stands you more in hand
‚Ä≠  To see his person plac‚Äôd in, and command
‚Ä≠  That instantly your heralds fill-in wine,
‚Ä≠  That to the God that doth in lightnings shine
‚Ä≠  We may do sacrifice; for he is there,
‚Ä≠  Where these his rev‚Äôrend suppliants appear.
‚Ä≠  Let what you have within be brought abroad,
‚Ä≠  To sup the stranger.  All these would have show‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  This fit respect to him, but that they stay
‚Ä≠  For your precedence, that should grace the way.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     When this had added to the well-inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  And sacred order of Alcinous‚Äô mind,
‚Ä≠  Then of the great-in-wit the hand he seis‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And from the ashes his fair person rais‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Advanc‚Äôd him to a well-adorn√©d throne,
‚Ä≠  And from his seat rais‚Äôd his most lov√©d son,
‚Ä≠  Laodamas, that next himself was set,
‚Ä≠  To give him place.  The handmaid then did get
‚Ä≠  An ewer of gold, with water fill‚Äôd, which plac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Upon a caldron, all with silver grac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  She pour‚Äôd out on their hands.  And then was spread
‚Ä≠  A table, which the butler set with bread,
‚Ä≠  As others serv‚Äôd with other food the board,
‚Ä≠  In all the choice the present could afford.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses meat and wine took; and then thus
‚Ä≠  The king the herald call‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúPontonous!
‚Ä≠  Serve wine through all the house, that all may pay
‚Ä≠  Rites to the Lightner, who is still in way
‚Ä≠  With humble suppliants, and them pursues
‚Ä≠  With all benign and hospitable dues.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Pontonous gave act to all he will‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And honey-sweetness-giving-minds wine fill‚Äôd,  [6]
‚Ä≠  Disposing it in cups for all to drink.
‚Ä≠  All having drunk what either‚Äôs heart could think
‚Ä≠  Fit for due sacrifice, Alcinous said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúHear me, ye dukes that the Ph√¶acians lead,
‚Ä≠  And you our counsellors, that I may now
‚Ä≠  Discharge the charge my mind suggests to you,
‚Ä≠  For this our guest:  Feast past, and this night‚Äôs sleep,
‚Ä≠  Next morn, our senate summon‚Äôd, we will keep
‚Ä≠  Justs, sacred to the Gods, and this our guest
‚Ä≠  Receive in solemn court with fitting feast;
‚Ä≠  Then think of his return, that, under hand
‚Ä≠  Of our deduction, his natural land
‚Ä≠  (Without more toil or care, and with delight,
‚Ä≠  And that soon giv‚Äôn him, how far-hence dissite
‚Ä≠  Soever it can be) he may ascend;
‚Ä≠  And in the mean time without wrong attend,
‚Ä≠  Or other want, fit means to that ascent.  [7]
‚Ä≠  What, after, austere Fates shall make th‚Äô event
‚Ä≠  Of his life‚Äôs thread, now spinning, and began
‚Ä≠  When his pain‚Äôd mother freed his root of man,
‚Ä≠  He must endure in all kinds.  If some God
‚Ä≠  Perhaps abides with us in his abode,
‚Ä≠  And other things will think upon than we,
‚Ä≠  The Gods‚Äô wills stand, who ever yet were free
‚Ä≠  Of their appearance to us, when to them
‚Ä≠  We offer‚Äôd hecatombs of fit esteem,
‚Ä≠  And would at feast sit with us, ev‚Äôn where we
‚Ä≠  Order‚Äôd our session.  They would likewise be
‚Ä≠  Encount‚Äôrers of us, when in way alone
‚Ä≠  About his fit affairs went any one.
‚Ä≠  Nor let them cloak themselves in any care
‚Ä≠  To do us comfort, we as near them are,
‚Ä≠  As are the Cyclops, or the impious race  [8]
‚Ä≠  Of earthy giants, that would heav‚Äôn outface.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Ulysses answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúLet some other doubt
‚Ä≠  Employ your thoughts than what your words give out,
‚Ä≠  Which intimate a kind of doubt that I
‚Ä≠  Should shadow in this shape a Deity.
‚Ä≠  I bear no such least semblance, or in wit,
‚Ä≠  Virtue, or person.  What may well befit
‚Ä≠  One of those mortals, whom you chiefly know
‚Ä≠  Bears up and down the burthen of the woe
‚Ä≠  Appropriate to poor man, give that to me;
‚Ä≠  Of whose moans I sit in the most degree,
‚Ä≠  And might say more, sustaining griefs that all
‚Ä≠  The Gods consent to; no one ‚Äôtwixt their fall
‚Ä≠  And my unpitied shoulders letting down
‚Ä≠  The least diversion.  Be the grace then shown,
‚Ä≠  To let me taste your free-giv‚Äôn food in peace.
‚Ä≠  _Through greatest grief the belly must have ease;
‚Ä≠  Worse than an envious belly nothing is._
‚Ä≠  It will command his strict necessities,
‚Ä≠  Of men most griev‚Äôd in body or in mind,
‚Ä≠  That are in health, and will not give their kind
‚Ä≠  A desp‚Äôrate wound.  When most with cause I grieve,
‚Ä≠  It bids me still, Eat, man, and drink, and live;
‚Ä≠  And this makes all forgot.  Whatever ill
‚Ä≠  I ever bear, it ever bids me fill.
‚Ä≠  But this ease is but forc‚Äôd, and will not last,
‚Ä≠  Till what the mind likes be as well embrac‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  And therefore let me wish you would partake
‚Ä≠  In your late purpose; when the morn shall make
‚Ä≠  Her next appearance, deign me but the grace,
‚Ä≠  Unhappy man, that I may once embrace
‚Ä≠  My country-earth.  Though I be still thrust at
‚Ä≠  By ancient ills, yet make me but see that.
‚Ä≠  And then let life go, when withal I see
‚Ä≠  My high-roof‚Äôd large house, lands, and family.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This all approv‚Äôd; and each will‚Äôd ev‚Äôry one,
‚Ä≠  Since he hath said so fairly, set him gone.
‚Ä≠     Feast past and sacrifice, to sleep all vow
‚Ä≠  Their eyes at either‚Äôs house.  Ulysses now
‚Ä≠  Was left here with Alcinous, and his Queen,
‚Ä≠  The all-lov‚Äôd Arete.  The handmaids then
‚Ä≠  The vessel of the banquet took away.
‚Ä≠  When Arete set eye on his array;
‚Ä≠  Knew both his out and under weed, which she
‚Ä≠  Made with her maids; and mus‚Äôd by what means he
‚Ä≠  Obtain‚Äôd their wearing; which she made request
‚Ä≠  To know, and wings gave to these speeches:  ‚ÄúGuest!
‚Ä≠  First let me ask, what, and from whence you are?
‚Ä≠  And then, who grac‚Äôd you with the weeds you wear?
‚Ä≠  Said you not lately, you had err‚Äôd at seas,
‚Ä≠  And thence arriv‚Äôd here?‚Äù  Laertiades
‚Ä≠  To this thus answer‚Äôd:  ‚Äú‚ÄôTis a pain, O Queen,
‚Ä≠  Still to be op‚Äôning wounds wrought deep, and green,
‚Ä≠  Of which the Gods have open‚Äôd store in me;
‚Ä≠  Yet your will must be serv‚Äôd.  Far hence, at sea,
‚Ä≠  There lies an isle, that bears Ogygia‚Äôs name,
‚Ä≠  Where Atlas‚Äô daughter, the ingenious dame,
‚Ä≠  Fair-hair‚Äôd Calypso lives; a Goddess grave,
‚Ä≠  And with whom men nor Gods society have;
‚Ä≠  Yet I, past man unhappy, liv‚Äôd alone,
‚Ä≠  By Heav‚Äôn‚Äôs wrath forc‚Äôd, her house-companion.
‚Ä≠  For Jove had with a fervent lightning cleft
‚Ä≠  My ship in twain, and far at black sea left
‚Ä≠  Me and my soldiers; all whose lives I lost.
‚Ä≠  I in mine arms the keel took, and was tost
‚Ä≠  Nine days together up from wave to wave.
‚Ä≠  The tenth grim night, the angry Deities drave
‚Ä≠  Me and my wrack on th‚Äô isle, in which doth dwell
‚Ä≠  Dreadful Calypso; who exactly well
‚Ä≠  Receiv‚Äôd and nourish‚Äôd me, and promise made
‚Ä≠  To make me deathless, nor should age invade
‚Ä≠  My pow‚Äôrs with his deserts through all my days.
‚Ä≠  All mov‚Äôd not me, and therefore, on her stays,
‚Ä≠  Sev‚Äôn years she made me lie; and there spent I
‚Ä≠  The long time, steeping in the misery
‚Ä≠  Of ceaseless tears the garments I did wear,
‚Ä≠  From her fair hand.  The eighth revolv√©d year
‚Ä≠  (Or by her chang‚Äôd mind, or by charge of Jove)
‚Ä≠  She gave provok‚Äôd way to my wish‚Äôd remove,
‚Ä≠  And in a many-jointed ship, with wine
‚Ä≠  Dainty in savour, bread, and weeds divine,
‚Ä≠  Sign‚Äôd, with a harmless and sweet wind, my pass.
‚Ä≠  Then sev‚Äônteen days at sea I homeward was,
‚Ä≠  And by the eighteenth the dark hills appear‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  That your earth thrusts up.  Much my heart was cheer‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Unhappy man, for that was but a beam,
‚Ä≠  To show I yet had agonies extreme
‚Ä≠  To put in suff''rance, which th‚Äô Earth-shaker sent,
‚Ä≠  Crossing my way with tempests violent,
‚Ä≠  Unmeasur‚Äôd seas up-lifting, nor would give
‚Ä≠  The billows leave to let my vessel live
‚Ä≠  The least time quiet, that ev‚Äôn sigh‚Äôd to bear
‚Ä≠  Their bitter outrage, which, at last, did tear
‚Ä≠  Her sides in pieces, set on by the winds.
‚Ä≠  I yet through-swum the waves that your shore binds,
‚Ä≠  Till wind and water threw me up to it;
‚Ä≠  When, coming forth, a ruthless billow smit
‚Ä≠  Against huge rocks, and an accessless shore,
‚Ä≠  My mangl‚Äôd body.  Back again I bore,
‚Ä≠  And swum till I was fall‚Äôn upon a flood,
‚Ä≠  Whose shores, methought, on good advantage stood
‚Ä≠  For my receipt, rock-free, and fenc‚Äôd from wind;
‚Ä≠  And this I put for, gath‚Äôring up my mind.
‚Ä≠  Then the divine night came, and treading earth,
‚Ä≠  Close by the flood that had from Jove her birth,
‚Ä≠  Within a thicket I repos‚Äôd; when round
‚Ä≠  I ruffled up fall‚Äôn leaves in heap; and found,
‚Ä≠  Let fall from heav‚Äôn, a sleep interminate.
‚Ä≠  And here my heart, long time excruciate,
‚Ä≠  Amongst the leaves I rested all that night,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn till the morning and meridian light.
‚Ä≠  The sun declining then, delightsome sleep
‚Ä≠  No longer laid my temples in his steep,
‚Ä≠  But forth I went, and on the shore might see
‚Ä≠  Your daughter‚Äôs maids play.  Like a Deity
‚Ä≠  She shin‚Äôd above them; and I pray‚Äôd to her,
‚Ä≠  And she in disposition did prefer
‚Ä≠  Noblesse, and wisdom, no more low than might
‚Ä≠  Become the goodness of a Goddess‚Äô height.
‚Ä≠  Nor would you therefore hope, suppos‚Äôd distrest
‚Ä≠  As I was then, and old, to find the least
‚Ä≠  Of any grace from her, being younger far.
‚Ä≠  _With young folks Wisdom makes her commerce rare._
‚Ä≠  Yet she in all abundance did bestow
‚Ä≠  Both wine, that makes the blood in humans grow,  [9]
‚Ä≠  And food, and bath‚Äôd me in the flood, and gave
‚Ä≠  The weeds to me which now ye see me have.
‚Ä≠  This through my griefs I tell you, and ‚Äôtis true.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Alcinous answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúGuest!  my daughter knew
‚Ä≠  Least of what most you give her; nor became
‚Ä≠  The course she took, to let with ev‚Äôry dame
‚Ä≠  Your person lackey; nor hath with them brought
‚Ä≠  Yourself home too; which first you had besought.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO blame her not,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúheroical lord,
‚Ä≠  Nor let me hear against her worth a word.
‚Ä≠  She faultless is, and wish‚Äôd I would have gone
‚Ä≠  With all her women home, but I alone
‚Ä≠  Would venture my receipt here, having fear
‚Ä≠  And rev‚Äôrend awe of accidents that were
‚Ä≠  Of likely issue; both your wrath to move,
‚Ä≠  And to inflame the common people‚Äôs love
‚Ä≠  Of speaking ill, to which they soon give place.
‚Ä≠  _We men are all a most suspicious race.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúMy guest,‚Äù  said he,  ‚ÄúI use not to be stirr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To wrath too rashly; and where are preferr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To men‚Äôs conceits things that may both ways fail,
‚Ä≠  The noblest ever should the most prevail.
‚Ä≠  Would Jove our Father, Pallas, and the Sun,
‚Ä≠  That, were you still as now, and could but run
‚Ä≠  One fate with me, you would my daughter wed,
‚Ä≠  And be my son-in-law, still vow‚Äôd to lead
‚Ä≠  Your rest of life here!  I a house would give,
‚Ä≠  And household goods, so freely you would live,
‚Ä≠  Confin‚Äôd with us.  But ‚Äôgainst your will shall none
‚Ä≠  Contain you here, since that were violence done
‚Ä≠  To Jove our Father.  For your passage home,
‚Ä≠  That you may well know we can overcome
‚Ä≠  So great a voyage, thus it shall succeed:
‚Ä≠  To-morrow shall our men take all their heed,
‚Ä≠  While you securely sleep, to see the seas
‚Ä≠  In calmest temper, and, if that will please,
‚Ä≠  Show you your country and your house ere night,
‚Ä≠  Though far beyond Eub≈ìa be that sight.
‚Ä≠  And this Eub≈ìa, as our subjects say
‚Ä≠  That have been there and seen, is far away,
‚Ä≠  Farthest from us of all the parts they know;
‚Ä≠  And made the trial when they help‚Äôd to row
‚Ä≠  The gold-lock‚Äôd Rhadamanth, to give him view
‚Ä≠  Of earth-born Tityus; whom their speeds did show
‚Ä≠  In that far-off Eub≈ìa, the same day
‚Ä≠  They set from hence; and home made good their way
‚Ä≠  With ease again, and him they did convey.
‚Ä≠  Which I report to you, to let you see
‚Ä≠  How swift my ships are, and how matchlessly
‚Ä≠  My young Ph√¶acians with their oars prevail,
‚Ä≠  To beat the sea through, and assist a sail.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This cheer‚Äôd Ulysses, who in private pray‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúI would to Jove our Father, what he said,
‚Ä≠  He could perform at all parts; he should then
‚Ä≠  Be glorified for ever, and I gain
‚Ä≠  My natural country.‚Äù  This discourse they had;
‚Ä≠  When fair-arm‚Äôd Arete her handmaids bad
‚Ä≠  A bed make in the portico, and ply
‚Ä≠  With clothes, the cov‚Äôring tapestry,
‚Ä≠  The blankets purple; well-napp‚Äôd waistcoats too,
‚Ä≠  To wear for more warmth.  What these had to do,
‚Ä≠  They torches took and did.  The bed purvey‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  They mov‚Äôd Ulysses for his rest, and said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúCome guest, your bed is fit, now frame to rest.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Motion of sleep was gracious to their guest;
‚Ä≠  Which now he took profoundly, being laid
‚Ä≠  Within a loop-hole tow‚Äôr, where was convey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The sounding portico.  The King took rest
‚Ä≠  In a retir‚Äôd part of the house; where drest
‚Ä≠  The Queen her self a bed, and trundlebed,
‚Ä≠  And by her lord repos‚Äôd her rev‚Äôrend head.

‚Ä≠  THE EIGHTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  The Peers of the Ph√¶acian State
‚Ä≠  A Council call, to consolate
‚Ä≠  Ulysses with all means for home.
‚Ä≠  The Council to a banquet come,
‚Ä≠  Invited by the King.  Which done,
‚Ä≠  Assays for hurling of the stone
‚Ä≠  The youths make with the stranger-king.
‚Ä≠  Demodocus, at feast, doth sing
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô adult‚Äôry of the God of Arms
‚Ä≠  With Her that rules in amorous charms;
‚Ä≠  And after sings the entercourse
‚Ä≠  Of acts about th‚Äô Ep√¶an horse.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _ŒòŒ∑ÃëœÑŒ±._
‚Ä≠     The council‚Äôs frame
‚Ä≠        At fleet applied.
‚Ä≠     In strifes of game
‚Ä≠        Ulysses tried.

‚Ä≠  Now when the rosy-finger‚Äôd Morn arose,
‚Ä≠  The sacred pow‚Äôr Alcinous did dispose
‚Ä≠  Did likewise rise; and, like him, left his ease
‚Ä≠  The city-razer Laertiades.
‚Ä≠  The Council at the navy was design‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  To which Alcinous, with the sacred mind,
‚Ä≠  Came first of all.  On polish‚Äôd stones they sate,
‚Ä≠  Near to the navy.  To increase the state,
‚Ä≠  Minerva took the herald‚Äôs form on her,
‚Ä≠  That serv‚Äôd Alcinous, studious to prefer
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô suit for home.  About the town
‚Ä≠  She made quick way, and fill‚Äôd with the renown
‚Ä≠  Of that design the ears of ev‚Äôry man,
‚Ä≠  Proclaiming thus:  ‚ÄúPeers Ph√¶acensian!
‚Ä≠  And Men of Council, all haste to the court,
‚Ä≠  To hear the stranger that made late resort
‚Ä≠  To King Alcinous, long time lost at sea,
‚Ä≠  And is in person like a Deity.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This all their pow‚Äôrs set up, and spirit instill‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And straight the court and seats with men were fill‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  The whole state wonder‚Äôd at Laertes‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  When they beheld him.  Pallas put him on
‚Ä≠  A supernatural and heav‚Äônly dress,
‚Ä≠  Enlarg‚Äôd him with a height, and goodliness
‚Ä≠  In breast and shoulders, that he might appear
‚Ä≠  Gracious, and grave, and reverend, and bear
‚Ä≠  A perfect hand on his performance there
‚Ä≠  In all the trials they resolv‚Äôd t‚Äô impose.
‚Ä≠     All met, and gather‚Äôd in attention close,
‚Ä≠  Alcinous thus bespake them:  ‚ÄúDukes, and lords,
‚Ä≠  Hear me digest my hearty thoughts in words.
‚Ä≠  This stranger here, whose travels found my court,
‚Ä≠  I know not, nor can tell if his resort
‚Ä≠  From East or West comes; but his suit is this:
‚Ä≠  That to his country-earth we would dismiss
‚Ä≠  His hither-forc√©d person, and doth bear
‚Ä≠  The mind to pass it under ev‚Äôry peer;
‚Ä≠  Whom I prepare, and stir up, making known
‚Ä≠  My free desire of his deducti√≥n.
‚Ä≠  Nor shall there ever any other man
‚Ä≠  That tries the goodness Ph√¶acensian
‚Ä≠  In me, and my court‚Äôs entertainment, stay,
‚Ä≠  Mourning for passage, under least delay.
‚Ä≠  Come then, a ship into the sacred seas,
‚Ä≠  New-built, now launch we; and from out our prease
‚Ä≠  Choose two-and-fifty youths, of all, the best
‚Ä≠  To use an oar.  All which see straight imprest,
‚Ä≠  And in their oar-bound seats.  Let others hie
‚Ä≠  Home to our court, commanding instantly
‚Ä≠  The solemn preparation of a feast,
‚Ä≠  In which provision may for any guest
‚Ä≠  Be made at my charge.  Charge of these low things
‚Ä≠  I give our youth.  You, sceptre-bearing kings,
‚Ä≠  Consort me home, and help with grace to use
‚Ä≠  This guest of ours; no one man shall refuse.
‚Ä≠     Some other of you haste, and call to us
‚Ä≠  The sacred singer, grave Demodocus,
‚Ä≠  To whom hath God giv‚Äôn song that can excite
‚Ä≠  The heart of whom he listeth with delight.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said, he led.  The sceptre-bearers lent
‚Ä≠  Their free attendance; and with all speed went
‚Ä≠  The herald for the sacred man-in-song.
‚Ä≠  Youths two-and-fifty, chosen from the throng,
‚Ä≠  Went, as was will‚Äôd, to the untam‚Äôd sea‚Äôs shore;
‚Ä≠  Where come, they launch‚Äôd the ship, the mast it bore
‚Ä≠  Advanc‚Äôd, sails hois√©d, ev‚Äôry seat his oar
‚Ä≠  Gave with a leather thong.  The deep moist then
‚Ä≠  They further reach‚Äôd.  The dry streets flow‚Äôd with men,
‚Ä≠  That troop‚Äôd up to the king‚Äôs capacious court,
‚Ä≠  Whose porticos were chok‚Äôd with the resort,
‚Ä≠  Whose walls were hung with men, young, old, thrust there
‚Ä≠  In mighty concourse; for whose promis‚Äôd cheer
‚Ä≠  Alcinous slew twelve sheep, eight white-tooth‚Äôd swine,
‚Ä≠  Two crook-haunch‚Äôd beeves; which flay‚Äôd and dress‚Äôd, divine
‚Ä≠  The show was of so many a jocund guest,
‚Ä≠  All set together at so set a feast.
‚Ä≠  To whose accomplish‚Äôd state the herald then
‚Ä≠  The lovely singer led; who past all mean
‚Ä≠  The Muse affected, gave him good, and ill,
‚Ä≠  His eyes put out, but put in soul at will.
‚Ä≠  His place was giv‚Äôn him in a chair all grac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With silver studs, and ‚Äôgainst a pillar plac‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠  Where, as the centre to the state, he rests,
‚Ä≠  And round about the circle of the guests.
‚Ä≠  The herald on a pin above his head
‚Ä≠  His soundful harp hung, to whose height he led
‚Ä≠  His hand for taking of it down at will,
‚Ä≠  A board set by with food, and forth did fill
‚Ä≠  A bowl of wine, to drink at his desire.
‚Ä≠  The rest then fell to feast, and, when the fire
‚Ä≠  Of appetite was quench‚Äôd, the Muse inflam‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The sacred singer.  Of men highliest fam‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  He sung the glories, and a poem penn‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  That in applause did ample heav‚Äôn ascend.
‚Ä≠  Whose subject was, the stern Contenti√≥n
‚Ä≠  Betwixt Ulysses and great Thetis‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  As, at a banquet sacred to the Gods,
‚Ä≠  In dreadful language they express‚Äôd their odds.
‚Ä≠  When Agamemnon sat rejoic‚Äôd in soul
‚Ä≠  To hear the Greek peers jar in terms so foul;
‚Ä≠  For augur Ph≈ìbus in presage had told
‚Ä≠  The King of men (desirous to unfold
‚Ä≠  The war‚Äôs perplex‚Äôd end, and being therefore gone
‚Ä≠  In heav‚Äônly Pythia to the porch of stone,)
‚Ä≠  That then the end of all griefs should begin
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTwixt Greece and Troy, when Greece (with strife to win
‚Ä≠  That wish‚Äôd conclusion) in her kings should jar,
‚Ä≠  And plead, if force or wit must end the war.
‚Ä≠     This brave Contention did the poet sing,
‚Ä≠  Expressing so the spleen of either king,
‚Ä≠  That his large purple weed Ulysses held
‚Ä≠  Before his face and eyes, since thence distill‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Tears uncontain‚Äôd; which he obscur‚Äôd, in fear
‚Ä≠  To let th‚Äô observing presence note a tear.
‚Ä≠  But, when his sacred song the mere divine
‚Ä≠  Had giv‚Äôn an end, a goblet crown‚Äôd with wine
‚Ä≠  Ulysses, drying his wet eyes, did seize,  [1]
‚Ä≠  And sacrific‚Äôd to those Gods that would please
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô inspire the poet with a song so fit
‚Ä≠  To do him honour, and renown his wit.
‚Ä≠  His tears then stay‚Äôd.  But when again began,
‚Ä≠  By all the kings‚Äô desires, the moving man,
‚Ä≠  Again Ulysses could not choose but yield
‚Ä≠  To that soft passion, which again, withheld,
‚Ä≠  He kept so cunningly from sight, that none,
‚Ä≠  Except Alcinous himself alone,
‚Ä≠  Discern‚Äôd him mov‚Äôd so much.  But he sat next,
‚Ä≠  And heard him deeply sigh; which his pretext
‚Ä≠  Could not keep hid from him.  Yet he conceal‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His utt‚Äôrance of it, and would have it held
‚Ä≠  From all the rest, brake off the song, and this
‚Ä≠  Said to those oar-affecting peers of his:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúPrinces, and peers!  We now are satiate
‚Ä≠  With sacred song that fits a feast of state,
‚Ä≠  With wine and food.  Now then to field, and try
‚Ä≠  In all kinds our approv‚Äôd activity,
‚Ä≠  That this our guest may give his friends to know,
‚Ä≠  In his return, that we as little owe
‚Ä≠  To fights and wrastlings, leaping, speed-of race,
‚Ä≠  As these our court-rites; and commend our grace
‚Ä≠  In all to all superior.‚Äù  Forth he led,
‚Ä≠  The peers and people troop‚Äôd up to their head.
‚Ä≠  Nor must Demodocus be left within;
‚Ä≠  Whose harp the herald hung upon the pin,
‚Ä≠  His hand in his took, and abroad he brought
‚Ä≠  The heav‚Äônly poet, out the same way wrought
‚Ä≠  That did the princes, and what they would see
‚Ä≠  With admiration, with his company
‚Ä≠  They wish‚Äôd to honour.  To the place of game
‚Ä≠  These throng‚Äôd; and after routs of other came,
‚Ä≠  Of all sort, infinite.  Of youths that strove,
‚Ä≠  Many and strong rose to their trial‚Äôs love.
‚Ä≠  Up rose Acroneus, and Ocyalus,
‚Ä≠  Elatreus, Prymneus, and Anchialus,  [2]
‚Ä≠  Nauteus, Eretmeus, Thoen, Prore√ºs,
‚Ä≠  Pont√´us, and the strong Amphialus
‚Ä≠  Son to Tectonides Polyne√ºs.
‚Ä≠  Up rose to these the great Euryalus,
‚Ä≠  In action like the Homicide of War.
‚Ä≠  Naubolides, that was for person far
‚Ä≠  Past all the rest, but one he could not pass,
‚Ä≠  Nor any thought improve, Laodamas.
‚Ä≠  Up Anabesin√´us then arose;
‚Ä≠  And three sons of the Sceptre-state, and those
‚Ä≠  Were Halius, the fore-prais‚Äôd Laodamas,
‚Ä≠  And Clyton√´us like a God in grace.
‚Ä≠  These first the foot-game tried, and from the lists
‚Ä≠  Took start together.  Up the dust in mists
‚Ä≠  They hurl‚Äôd about, as in their speed they flew;
‚Ä≠  But Clyton√´us first of all the crew
‚Ä≠  A stitch‚Äôs length in any fallow field
‚Ä≠  Made good his pace; when, where the judges yield
‚Ä≠  The prize and praise, his glorious speed arriv‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Next, for the boist‚Äôrous wrastling game they striv‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  At which Euryalus the rest outshone.
‚Ä≠  At leap Amphialus, At the hollow stone
‚Ä≠  Elatre√ºs excell‚Äôd.  At buffets, last,
‚Ä≠  Laodamas, the king‚Äôs fair son, surpast.
‚Ä≠     When all had striv‚Äôd in these assays their fill,
‚Ä≠  Laodamas said:  ‚ÄúCome friends, let‚Äôs prove what skill
‚Ä≠  This stranger hath attain‚Äôd to in our sport.
‚Ä≠  Methinks, he must be of the active sort,
‚Ä≠  His calves, thighs, hands, and well-knit shoulders show
‚Ä≠  That Nature disposition did bestow
‚Ä≠  To fit with fact their form.  Nor wants he prime.
‚Ä≠  But sour affliction, made a mate with time,
‚Ä≠  Makes time the more seen.  Nor imagine I,
‚Ä≠  A worse thing to enforce debility
‚Ä≠  Than is the sea, though nature ne‚Äôer so strong
‚Ä≠  Knits one together.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNor conceive you wrong,‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Replied Euryalus,  ‚Äúbut prove his blood
‚Ä≠  With what you question.‚Äù  In the midst then stood
‚Ä≠  Renown‚Äôd Laodamas, and prov‚Äôd him thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúCome, stranger-father, and assay with us
‚Ä≠  Your pow‚Äôrs in these contentions.  If your show
‚Ä≠  Be answer‚Äôd with your worth, ‚Äôtis fit that you
‚Ä≠  Should know these conflicts.  Nor doth glory stand
‚Ä≠  On any worth more, in a man‚Äôs command,
‚Ä≠  Than to be strenuous both of foot and hand.
‚Ä≠  Come then, make proof with us, discharge your mind
‚Ä≠  Of discontentments; for not far behind
‚Ä≠  Comes your deduction, ship is ready now,  [3]
‚Ä≠  And men, and all things.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúdost thou
‚Ä≠  Mock me, Laodamas, and these strifes bind
‚Ä≠  My pow‚Äôrs to answer?  I am more inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To cares than conflict.  Much sustain‚Äôd I have,
‚Ä≠  And still am suff‚Äôring.  I come here to crave,
‚Ä≠  In your assemblies, means to be dismist,
‚Ä≠  And pray both kings and subjects to assist.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Euryalus an open brawl began,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúI take you, sir, for no such man
‚Ä≠  As fits these honour‚Äôd strifes.  A number more
‚Ä≠  Strange men there are that I would choose before.
‚Ä≠  To one that loves to lie aship-board much,
‚Ä≠  Or is the prince of sailors; or to such
‚Ä≠  As traffic far and near, and nothing mind
‚Ä≠  But freight, and passage, and a foreright wind;
‚Ä≠  Or to a victualler of a ship; or men
‚Ä≠  That set up all their pow‚Äôrs for rampant gain;
‚Ä≠  I can compare, or hold you like to be:
‚Ä≠  But, for a wrastler, or of quality
‚Ä≠  Fit for contentions noble, you abhor
‚Ä≠  From worth of any such competitor.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Ulysses, frowning, answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúStranger, far
‚Ä≠  Thy words are from the fashions regular
‚Ä≠  Of kind, or honour.  Thou art in thy guise
‚Ä≠  Like to a man that authors injuries.  [4]
‚Ä≠  I see, the Gods to all men give not all
‚Ä≠  Manly addiction, wisdom, words that fall,
‚Ä≠  Like dice, upon the square still.  Some man takes
‚Ä≠  Ill form from parents, but God often makes
‚Ä≠  That fault of form up with observ‚Äôd repair
‚Ä≠  Of pleasing speech, that makes him held for fair,
‚Ä≠  That makes him speak securely, makes him shine
‚Ä≠  In an assembly with a grace divine.
‚Ä≠  Men take delight to see how ev‚Äônly lie
‚Ä≠  His words asteep in honey modesty.
‚Ä≠  Another, then, hath fashion like a God,
‚Ä≠  But in his language he is foul and broad.
‚Ä≠  And such art thou.  A person fair is giv‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  But nothing else is in thee sent from heav‚Äôn;
‚Ä≠  For in thee lurks a base and earthy soul,
‚Ä≠  And t‚Äô hast compell‚Äôd me, with a speech most foul,
‚Ä≠  To be thus bitter.  I am not unseen
‚Ä≠  In these fair strifes, as thy words overween,
‚Ä≠  But in the first rank of the best I stand;
‚Ä≠  At least I did, when youth and strength of hand
‚Ä≠  Made me thus confident, but now am worn
‚Ä≠  With woes and labours, as a human born
‚Ä≠  To bear all anguish.  Suffer‚Äôd much I have.
‚Ä≠  The war of men, and the inhuman wave,
‚Ä≠  Have I driv‚Äôn through at all parts.  But with all
‚Ä≠  My waste in suff‚Äôrance, what yet may fall
‚Ä≠  In my performance, at these strifes I‚Äôll try.
‚Ä≠  Thy speech hath mov‚Äôd, and made my wrath run high.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, with robe and all, he grasp‚Äôd a stone,
‚Ä≠  A little graver than was ever thrown
‚Ä≠  By these Ph√¶acians in their wrastling rout,
‚Ä≠  More firm, more massy; which, turn‚Äôd round about,
‚Ä≠  He hurried from him with a hand so strong
‚Ä≠  It sung, and flew, and over all the throng,
‚Ä≠  That at the others‚Äô marks stood, quite it went;
‚Ä≠  Yet down fell all beneath it, fearing spent
‚Ä≠  The force that drave it flying from his hand,
‚Ä≠  As it a dart were, or a walking wand;
‚Ä≠  And far past all the marks of all the rest
‚Ä≠  His wing stole way; when Pallas straight imprest
‚Ä≠  A mark at fall of it, resembling then
‚Ä≠  One of the navy-giv‚Äôn Ph√¶acian men,
‚Ä≠  And thus advanc‚Äôd Ulysses:  ‚ÄúOne, though blind,
‚Ä≠  O stranger, groping, may thy stone‚Äôs fall find,
‚Ä≠  For not amidst the rout of marks it fell,
‚Ä≠  But far before all.  Of thy worth think well,
‚Ä≠  And stand in all strifes.  No Ph√¶acian here
‚Ä≠  This bound can either better or come near.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Ulysses joy‚Äôd to hear that one man yet
‚Ä≠  Us‚Äôd him benignly, and would truth abet
‚Ä≠  In those contentions; and then thus smooth
‚Ä≠  He took his speech down:  ‚ÄúReach me that now, youth,
‚Ä≠  You shall, and straight I think, have one such more,
‚Ä≠  And one beyond it too.  And now, whose core
‚Ä≠  Stands sound and great within him, since ye have
‚Ä≠  Thus put my spleen up, come again and brave
‚Ä≠  The guest ye tempted, with such gross disgrace,
‚Ä≠  At wrastling, buffets, whirlbat, speed o‚Äô race;
‚Ä≠  At all, or either, I except at none,
‚Ä≠  But urge the whole state of you; only one,
‚Ä≠  I will not challenge in my forced boast,
‚Ä≠  And that‚Äôs Laodamas, for he‚Äôs mine host.  [5]
‚Ä≠  And who will fight, or wrangle, with his friend?
‚Ä≠  Unwise he is, and base, that will contend
‚Ä≠  With him that feeds him in a foreign place;
‚Ä≠  And takes all edge off from his own sought grace.
‚Ä≠  None else except I here, nor none despise,
‚Ä≠  But wish to know, and prove his faculties,
‚Ä≠  That dares appear now.  No strife ye can name
‚Ä≠  Am I unskill‚Äôd in; reckon any game
‚Ä≠  Of all that are, as many as there are
‚Ä≠  In use with men.  For archery I dare
‚Ä≠  Affirm myself not mean.  Of all a troop
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll make the first foe with mine arrow stoop,
‚Ä≠  Though with me ne‚Äôer so many fellows bend
‚Ä≠  Their bows at mark‚Äôd men, and affect their end.
‚Ä≠  Only was Philoctetes with his bow
‚Ä≠  Still my superior, when we Greeks would show
‚Ä≠  Our archery against our foes of Troy.
‚Ä≠  But all, that now by bread frail life enjoy,
‚Ä≠  I far hold my inferiors.  Men of old,
‚Ä≠  None now alive shall witness me so bold,
‚Ä≠  To vaunt equality with, such men as these,
‚Ä≠  ≈íchali√°n Eurytus, Hercules,
‚Ä≠  Who with their bows durst with the Gods contend;
‚Ä≠  And therefore caught Eurytus soon his end,
‚Ä≠  Nor died at home, in age, a rev‚Äôrend man.
‚Ä≠  But by the great incens√©d Delphian
‚Ä≠  Was shot to death, for daring competence
‚Ä≠  With him in all an archer‚Äôs excellence.
‚Ä≠  A spear I‚Äôll hurl as far as any man
‚Ä≠  Shall shoot a shaft.  How at a race I can
‚Ä≠  Bestir my feet, I only yield to fear,
‚Ä≠  And doubt to meet with my superior here.
‚Ä≠  So many seas so too much have misus‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  My limbs for race, and therefore have diffus‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A dissolution through my lov√©d knees.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he still‚Äôd all talking properties.
‚Ä≠  Alcinous only answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúO my guest,
‚Ä≠  In good part take we what you have been prest
‚Ä≠  With speech to answer.  You would make appear
‚Ä≠  Your virtues therefore, that will still shine where
‚Ä≠  Your only look is.  Yet must this man give
‚Ä≠  Your worth ill language; when, he does not live
‚Ä≠  In sort of mortals (whencesoe‚Äôer he springs,
‚Ä≠  That judgment hath to speak becoming things)
‚Ä≠  That will deprave your virtues.  Note then now
‚Ä≠  My speech, and what my love presents to you,
‚Ä≠  That you may tell hero√´s, when you come
‚Ä≠  To banquet with your wife and birth at home,
‚Ä≠  (Mindful of our worth) what deservings Jove
‚Ä≠  Hath put on our parts likewise, in remove
‚Ä≠  From sire to son, as an inherent grace
‚Ä≠  Kind, and perpetual.  We must needs give place
‚Ä≠  To other countrymen, and freely yield
‚Ä≠  We are not blameless in our fights of field,
‚Ä≠  Buffets, nor wrastlings; but in speed of feet,
‚Ä≠  And all the equipage that fits a fleet,
‚Ä≠  We boast us best; for table ever spread
‚Ä≠  With neighbour feasts, for garments varied,
‚Ä≠  For poesy, music, dancing, baths, and beds.
‚Ä≠  And now, Ph√¶acians, you that bear your heads
‚Ä≠  And feet with best grace in enamouring dance,
‚Ä≠  Enflame our guest here, that he may advance
‚Ä≠  Our worth past all the world‚Äôs to his home-friends,
‚Ä≠  As well for the unmatch‚Äôd grace that commends.
‚Ä≠  Your skill in footing of a dance, as theirs
‚Ä≠  That fly a race best.  And so, all affairs,
‚Ä≠  At which we boast us best, he best may try,
‚Ä≠  As sea-race, land-race, dance, and poesy.
‚Ä≠  Some one with instant speed to court retire,
‚Ä≠  And fetch Demodocus‚Äôs soundful lyre.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said the God-grac‚Äôd king; and quick resort
‚Ä≠  Pontonous made for that fair harp to court.
‚Ä≠     Nine of the lot-choos‚Äôd public rulers rose,
‚Ä≠  That all in those contentions did dispose,
‚Ä≠  Commanding a most smooth ground, and a wide,
‚Ä≠  And all the people in fair game aside.
‚Ä≠     Then with the rich harp came Pontonous,
‚Ä≠  And in the midst took place Demodocus.
‚Ä≠  About him then stood forth the choice young men,  [6]
‚Ä≠  That on man‚Äôs first youth made fresh entry then,
‚Ä≠  Had art to make their natural motion sweet,
‚Ä≠  And shook a most divine dance from their feet,
‚Ä≠  That twinkled star-like, mov‚Äôd as swift, and fine,
‚Ä≠  And beat the air so thin, they made it shine.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses wonder‚Äôd at it, but amaz‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  He stood in mind to hear the dance so phras‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  For, as they danc‚Äôd, Demodocus did sing,
‚Ä≠  The bright-crown‚Äôd Venus‚Äô love with Battle‚Äôs King;
‚Ä≠  As first they closely mix‚Äôd in th‚Äô house of fire.
‚Ä≠  What worlds of gifts won her to his desire,
‚Ä≠  Who then the night-and-day-bed did defile
‚Ä≠  Of good king Vulcan.  But in little while
‚Ä≠  The Sun their mixture saw, and came and told.
‚Ä≠  The bitter news did by his ears take hold
‚Ä≠  Of Vulcan‚Äôs heart.  Then to his forge he went,
‚Ä≠  And in his shrewd mind deep stuff did invent.
‚Ä≠  His mighty anvil in the stock he put,
‚Ä≠  And forg‚Äôd a net that none could loose or cut,
‚Ä≠  That when it had them it might hold them fast.
‚Ä≠  Which having finish‚Äôd, he made utmost haste
‚Ä≠  Up to the dear room where his wife he woo‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And, madly wrath with Mars, he all bestrow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The bed, and bed-posts, all the beam above
‚Ä≠  That cross‚Äôd the chamber; and a circle strove
‚Ä≠  Of his device to wrap in all the room.
‚Ä≠  And ‚Äôtwas as pure, as of a spider‚Äôs loom
‚Ä≠  The woof before ‚Äôtis wov‚Äôn.  No man nor God
‚Ä≠  Could set his eye on it, a sleight so odd
‚Ä≠  His art show‚Äôd in it.  All his craft bespent
‚Ä≠  About the bed, he feign‚Äôd as if he went
‚Ä≠  To well-built Lemnos, his most lov√©d town
‚Ä≠  Of all towns earthly; nor left this unknown
‚Ä≠  To golden-bridle-using Mars, who kept
‚Ä≠  No blind watch over him, but, seeing stept
‚Ä≠  His rival so aside, he hasted home
‚Ä≠  With fair-wreath‚Äôd Venus‚Äô love stung, who was come
‚Ä≠  New from the court of her most mighty Sire.
‚Ä≠  Mars enter‚Äôd, wrung her hand, and the retire
‚Ä≠  Her husband made to Lemnos told, and said;
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúNow, love, is Vulcan gone, let us to bed,
‚Ä≠  He‚Äôs for the barbarous Sintians.‚Äù  Well appay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Was Venus with it; and afresh assay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Their old encounter.  Down they went; and straight
‚Ä≠  About them cling‚Äôd the artificial sleight
‚Ä≠  Of most wise Vulcan; and were so ensnar‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  That neither they could stir their course prepar‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In any limb about them, nor arise.
‚Ä≠  And then they knew, they would no more disguise
‚Ä≠  Their close conveyance, but lay, forc‚Äôd, stone-still.
‚Ä≠  Back rush‚Äôd the both-foot-cook‚Äôd, but straight in skill,
‚Ä≠  From his near scout-hole turn‚Äôd, nor ever went
‚Ä≠  To any Lemnos, but the sure event
‚Ä≠  Left Ph≈ìbus to discover, who told all.
‚Ä≠  Then home hopp‚Äôd Vulcan, full of grief and gall,
‚Ä≠  Stood in the portal, and cried out so high,
‚Ä≠  That all the Gods heard;  ‚ÄúFather of the sky,
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôry other deathless God,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúCome all, and a ridiculous object see,
‚Ä≠  And yet not sufferable neither.  Come,
‚Ä≠  And witness how, when still I step from home,
‚Ä≠  Lame that I am, Jove‚Äôs daughter doth profess
‚Ä≠  To do me all the shameful offices,
‚Ä≠  Indignities, despites, that can be thought;
‚Ä≠  And loves this all-things-making-come-to-nought,
‚Ä≠  Since he is fair forsooth, foot-sound, and I
‚Ä≠  Took in my brain a little, legg‚Äôd awry.
‚Ä≠  And no fault mine, but all my parent‚Äôs fault,
‚Ä≠  Who should not get, if mock me, with my halt.
‚Ä≠  But see how fast they sleep, while I, in moan,
‚Ä≠  Am only made an idle looker on.
‚Ä≠  One bed their turn serves, and it must be mine;
‚Ä≠  I think yet, I have made their self-loves shine.
‚Ä≠  They shall no more wrong me, and none perceive;
‚Ä≠  Nor will they sleep together, I believe,
‚Ä≠  With too hot haste again.  Thus both shall lie
‚Ä≠  In craft, and force, till the extremity
‚Ä≠  Of all the dow‚Äôr I gave her sire (to gain
‚Ä≠  A dogg√©d set-fac‚Äôd girl, that will not stain
‚Ä≠  Her face with blushing, though she shame her head)
‚Ä≠  He pays me back.  She‚Äôs fair, but was no maid.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     While this long speech was making, all were come
‚Ä≠  To Vulcan‚Äôs wholly-brazen-founded home,
‚Ä≠  Earth-shaking Neptune, useful Mercury,
‚Ä≠  And far-shot Ph≈ìbus.  No She-Deity,
‚Ä≠  For shame, would show there.  All the give-good Gods
‚Ä≠  Stood in the portal, and past periods
‚Ä≠  Gave length to laughters, all rejoic‚Äôd to see
‚Ä≠  That which they said, that no impiety
‚Ä≠  Finds good success at th‚Äô end.   ‚ÄúAnd now,‚Äù  said one,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThe slow outgoes the swift.  Lame Vulcan, known
‚Ä≠  To be the slowest of the Gods, outgoes
‚Ä≠  Mars the most swift.  And this is that which grows
‚Ä≠  To greatest justice:  that adult‚Äôry‚Äôs sport,
‚Ä≠  Obtain‚Äôd by craft, by craft of other sort
‚Ä≠  (And lame craft too) is plagued, which grieves the more,
‚Ä≠  That sound limbs turning lame the lame restore.‚Äù  [7]
‚Ä≠     This speech amongst themselves they entertain‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  When Ph≈ìbus thus ask‚Äôd Hermes:  ‚ÄúThus enchain‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Wouldst thou be, Hermes, to be thus disclos‚Äôd?
‚Ä≠  Though with thee golden Venus were repos‚Äôd?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He soon gave that an answer:  ‚ÄúO,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThou king of archers, would ‚Äôtwere thus with me!
‚Ä≠  Though thrice so much shame; nay, though infinite
‚Ä≠  Were pour‚Äôd about me, and that ev‚Äôry light,
‚Ä≠  In great heav‚Äôn shining, witness‚Äôd all my harms,
‚Ä≠  So golden Venus slumber‚Äôd in mine arms.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The Gods again laugh‚Äôd; even the Watery State
‚Ä≠  Wrung out a laughter, but propitiate
‚Ä≠  Was still for Mars, and pray‚Äôd the God of Fire
‚Ä≠  He would dissolve him, off‚Äôring the desire
‚Ä≠  He made to Jove to pay himself, and said,
‚Ä≠  All due debts should be by the Gods repaid.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúPay me, no words,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúwhere deeds lend pain,
‚Ä≠  Wretched the words are giv‚Äôn for wretched men.
‚Ä≠  How shall I bind you in th‚Äô Immortals‚Äô sight,
‚Ä≠  If Mars be once loos‚Äôd, nor will pay his right?‚Äù  [8]
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúVulcan,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúif Mars should fly, nor see
‚Ä≠  Thy right repaid, it should be paid by me.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúYour word, so giv‚Äôn, I must accept,‚Äù  said he.
‚Ä≠  Which said, he loos‚Äôd them.  Mars then rush‚Äôd from sky,
‚Ä≠  And stoop‚Äôd cold Thrace.  The laughing Deity
‚Ä≠  For Cyprus was, and took her Paphian state,
‚Ä≠  Where she a grove, ne‚Äôer cut, had consecrate,
‚Ä≠  All with Arabian odours fum‚Äôd, and hath
‚Ä≠  An altar there, at which the Graces bathe,
‚Ä≠  And with immortal balms besmooth, her skin,
‚Ä≠  Fit for the bliss Immortals solace in;
‚Ä≠  Deck‚Äôd her in to-be-studi√©d attire,
‚Ä≠  And apt to set beholders‚Äô hearts on fire.
‚Ä≠     This sung the sacred muse, whose notes and words
‚Ä≠  The dancers‚Äô feet kept as his hands his chords.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses much was pleas‚Äôd, and all the crew.
‚Ä≠     This would the king have varied with a new
‚Ä≠  And pleasing measure, and perform√©d by
‚Ä≠  Two, with whom none would strive in dancery;
‚Ä≠  And those his sons were, that must therefore dance
‚Ä≠  Alone, and only to the harp advance,
‚Ä≠  Without the words.  And this sweet couple was
‚Ä≠  Young Halius, and divine Laodamas;
‚Ä≠  Who danc‚Äôd a ball-dance.  Then the rich-wrought ball,
‚Ä≠  That Polybus had made, of purple all,
‚Ä≠  They took to hand.  One threw it to the sky,
‚Ä≠  And then danc‚Äôd back; the other, capering high,
‚Ä≠  Would surely catch it ere his foot touch‚Äôd ground,
‚Ä≠  And up again advanc‚Äôd it, and so found
‚Ä≠  The other cause of dance; and then did he
‚Ä≠  Dance lofty tricks, till next it came to be
‚Ä≠  His turn to catch, and serve the other still.
‚Ä≠  When they had kept it up to either‚Äôs will,
‚Ä≠  They then danc‚Äôd ground tricks, oft mix‚Äôd hand in hand,
‚Ä≠  And did so gracefully their change command,
‚Ä≠  That all the other youth that stood at pause,
‚Ä≠  With deaf‚Äôning shouts, gave them the great applause.
‚Ä≠     Then said Ulysses:  ‚ÄúO, past all men here
‚Ä≠  Clear, not in pow‚Äôr, but in desert as clear,
‚Ä≠  You said your dancers did the world surpass,
‚Ä≠  And they perform it clear, and to amaze.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This won Alcinous‚Äô heart, and equal prize
‚Ä≠  He gave Ulysses, saying:  ‚ÄúMatchless wise,
‚Ä≠  Princes and rulers, I perceive our guest,
‚Ä≠  And therefore let our hospitable best
‚Ä≠  In fitting gifts be giv‚Äôn him:  Twelve chief kings
‚Ä≠  There are that order all the glorious things
‚Ä≠  Of this our kingdom; and, the thirteenth, I
‚Ä≠  Exist, as crown to all.  Let instantly
‚Ä≠  Be thirteen garments giv‚Äôn him, and of gold
‚Ä≠  Precious, and fine, a talent.  While we hold
‚Ä≠  This our assembly, be all fetch‚Äôd, and giv‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  That to our feast prepar‚Äôd, as to his heav‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  Our guest may enter.  And, that nothing be
‚Ä≠  Left unperform‚Äôd that fits his dignity,
‚Ä≠  Euryalus shall here conciliate
‚Ä≠  Himself with words and gifts, since past our rate
‚Ä≠  He gave bad language.‚Äù  This did all commend
‚Ä≠  And give in charge; and ev‚Äôry king did send
‚Ä≠  His herald for his gift.  Euryalus,
‚Ä≠  Answ‚Äôring for his part, said:  ‚ÄúAlcinous!
‚Ä≠  Our chief of all, since you command, I will
‚Ä≠  To this our guest by all means reconcile,
‚Ä≠  And give him this entirely-metall‚Äôd sword,
‚Ä≠  The handle massy silver, and the board,
‚Ä≠  That gives it cover, all of ivory,
‚Ä≠  New, and in all kinds worth his quality.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This put he straight into his hand, and said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúFrolic, O guest and father; if words fled
‚Ä≠  Have been offensive, let swift whirlwinds take
‚Ä≠  And ravish them from thought.  May all Gods make
‚Ä≠  Thy wife‚Äôs sight good to thee, in quick retreat
‚Ä≠  To all thy friends, and best-lov‚Äôd breeding seat,
‚Ä≠  Their long miss quitting with the greater joy;
‚Ä≠  In whose sweet vanish all thy worst annoy.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAnd frolic thou to all height, friend,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúWhich heav‚Äôn confirm with wish‚Äôd felicity;
‚Ä≠  Nor ever give again desire to thee
‚Ä≠  Of this sword‚Äôs use, which with affects so free,
‚Ä≠  In my reclaim, thou hast bestow‚Äôd on me.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, athwart his shoulders he put on
‚Ä≠  The right fair sword; and then did set the sun.
‚Ä≠  When all the gifts were brought, which back again
‚Ä≠  (With king Alcinous in all the train)
‚Ä≠  Were by the honour‚Äôd heralds borne to court;
‚Ä≠  Which his fair sons took, and from the resort
‚Ä≠  Laid by their rev‚Äôrend mother.  Each his throne
‚Ä≠  Of all the peers (which yet were overshone
‚Ä≠  In king Alcinous‚Äô command) ascended;
‚Ä≠  Whom he to pass as much in gifts contended,
‚Ä≠  And to his queen said:  ‚ÄúWife!  See brought me here
‚Ä≠  The fairest cabinet I have, and there
‚Ä≠  Impose a well-cleans‚Äôd in, and utter, weed.
‚Ä≠  A caldron heat with water, that with speed
‚Ä≠  Our guest well-bath‚Äôd, and all his gifts made sure,
‚Ä≠  It may a joyful appetite procure
‚Ä≠  To his succeeding feast, and make him hear
‚Ä≠  The poet‚Äôs hymn with the securer ear.
‚Ä≠  To all which I will add my bowl of gold,
‚Ä≠  In all frame curious, to make him hold
‚Ä≠  My memory always dear, and sacrifice
‚Ä≠  With it at home to all the Deities.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Then Arete her maids charg‚Äôd to set on
‚Ä≠  A well-siz‚Äôd caldron quickly.  Which was done,
‚Ä≠  Clear water pour‚Äôd in, flame made so entire,
‚Ä≠  It gilt the brass, and made the water fire.
‚Ä≠  In mean space, from her chamber brought the queen
‚Ä≠  A wealthy cabinet, where, pure and clean,
‚Ä≠  She put the garments, and the gold bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By that free state, and then the other vow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By her Alcinous, and said:  ‚ÄúNow, guest,
‚Ä≠  Make close and fast your gifts, lest, when you rest
‚Ä≠  Aship-board sweetly, in your way you meet
‚Ä≠  Some loss, that less may make your next sleep sweet.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This when Ulysses heard, all sure he made
‚Ä≠  Enclos‚Äôd and bound safe; for the saving trade
‚Ä≠  The rev‚Äôrend-for-her-wisdom, Circe, had
‚Ä≠  In foreyears taught him.  Then the handmaid bad
‚Ä≠  His worth to bathing; which rejoic‚Äôd his heart,
‚Ä≠  For, since he did with his Calypso part,
‚Ä≠  He had no hot baths; none had favour‚Äôd him,
‚Ä≠  Nor been so tender of his kingly limb.
‚Ä≠  But all the time he spent in her abode,
‚Ä≠  He liv‚Äôd respected as he were a God.
‚Ä≠     Cleans‚Äôd then and balm‚Äôd, fair shirt and robe put on,
‚Ä≠  Fresh come from bath, and to the feasters gone,
‚Ä≠  Nausicaa, that from the Gods‚Äô hands took
‚Ä≠  The sov‚Äôreign beauty of her blessed look,
‚Ä≠  Stood by a well-carv‚Äôd column of the room,
‚Ä≠  And through her eye her heart was overcome
‚Ä≠  With admiration of the port imprest
‚Ä≠  In his asp√©ct, and said:  ‚ÄúGod save you, guest!
‚Ä≠  Be cheerful, as in all the future state
‚Ä≠  Your home will show you in your better fate.
‚Ä≠  But yet, ev‚Äôn then, let this remember‚Äôd be,
‚Ä≠  Your life‚Äôs price I lent, and you owe it me.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The varied-in-all-counsels gave reply:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúNausicaa!  Flow‚Äôr of all this empery!
‚Ä≠  So Juno‚Äôs husband, that the strife for noise
‚Ä≠  Makes in the clouds, bless me with strife of joys,
‚Ä≠  In the desir‚Äôd day that my house shall show,
‚Ä≠  As I, as I to a Goddess there shall vow,
‚Ä≠  To thy fair hand that did my being give,
‚Ä≠  Which I‚Äôll acknowledge ev‚Äôry hour I live.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, Alcinous plac‚Äôd him by his side.
‚Ä≠  Then took they feast, and did in parts divide
‚Ä≠  The sev‚Äôral dishes, fill‚Äôd out wine, and then
‚Ä≠  The striv‚Äôd-for-for-his-worth of worthy men,  [9]
‚Ä≠  And rev‚Äôrenc‚Äôd-of-the-state, Demodocus
‚Ä≠  Was brought in by the good Pontonous.
‚Ä≠  In midst of all the guests they gave him place,
‚Ä≠  Against a lofty pillar, when this grace
‚Ä≠  The grac‚Äôd-with-wisdom did him:  From the chine,
‚Ä≠  That stood before him, of a white-tooth‚Äôd swine,
‚Ä≠  Being far the daintiest joint, mix‚Äôd through with fat,
‚Ä≠  He carv‚Äôd to him, and sent it where he sat
‚Ä≠  By his old friend the herald, willing thus:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúHerald, reach this to grave Demodocus,
‚Ä≠  Say, I salute him, and his worth embrace.
‚Ä≠  Poets deserve, past all the human race,
‚Ä≠  Rev‚Äôrend respect and honour, since the queen
‚Ä≠  Of knowledge, and the supreme worth in men,
‚Ä≠  The Muse, informs them, and loves all their race.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This reach‚Äôd the herald to him, who the grace
‚Ä≠  Receiv‚Äôd encourag‚Äôd; which, when feast was spent,
‚Ä≠  Ulysses amplified to this ascent:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúDemodocus!  I must prefer you far,
‚Ä≠  Past all your sort, if, or the Muse of war,
‚Ä≠  Jove‚Äôs daughter, prompts you, that the Greeks respects,
‚Ä≠  Or if the Sun, that those of Troy affects.
‚Ä≠  For I have heard you, since my coming, sing
‚Ä≠  The fate of Greece to an admir√©d string.
‚Ä≠  How much our suff‚Äôrance was, how much we wrought,
‚Ä≠  How much the actions rose-to when we fought.
‚Ä≠  So lively forming, as you had been there,
‚Ä≠  Or to some free relater lent your ear.
‚Ä≠  Forth then, and sing the wooden horse‚Äôs frame,
‚Ä≠  Built by Ep√´us, by the martial Dame
‚Ä≠  Taught the whole fabric; which, by force of sleight,
‚Ä≠  Ulysses brought into the city‚Äôs height,
‚Ä≠  When he had stuff‚Äôd it with as many men
‚Ä≠  As levell‚Äôd lofty Ilion with the plain.
‚Ä≠  With all which if you can as well enchant,
‚Ä≠  As with expression quick and elegant
‚Ä≠  You sung the rest, I will pronounce you clear
‚Ä≠  Inspir‚Äôd by God, past all that ever were.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, ev‚Äôn stirr‚Äôd by God up, he began,
‚Ä≠  And to his song fell, past the forms of man,
‚Ä≠  Beginning where the Greeks aship-board went,
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôry chief had set on fire his tent,
‚Ä≠  When th‚Äô other kings, in great Ulysses‚Äô guide,
‚Ä≠  In Troy‚Äôs vast market place the horse did hide,
‚Ä≠  From whence the Trojans up to Ilion drew
‚Ä≠  The dreadful engine.  Where sat all arew
‚Ä≠  Their kings about it; many counsels giv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  How to dispose it.  In three ways were driv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  Their whole distractions.  First, if they should feel
‚Ä≠  The hollow wood‚Äôs heart, search‚Äôd with piercing steel;
‚Ä≠  Or from the battlements drawn higher yet
‚Ä≠  Deject it headlong; or that counterfeit
‚Ä≠  So vast and novel set on sacred fire,
‚Ä≠  Vow‚Äôd to appease each anger‚Äôd Godhead‚Äôs ire.
‚Ä≠  On which opinion, they, thereafter, saw,
‚Ä≠  They then should have resolv‚Äôd; th‚Äô unalter‚Äôd law
‚Ä≠  Of fate presaging, that Troy then should end,
‚Ä≠  When th‚Äô hostile horse she should receive to friend,
‚Ä≠  For therein should the Grecian kings lie hid,
‚Ä≠  To bring the fate and death they after did.
‚Ä≠     He sung, besides, the Greeks‚Äô erupti√≥n
‚Ä≠  From those their hollow crafts, and horse foregone;
‚Ä≠  And how they made depopulation tread
‚Ä≠  Beneath her feet so high a city‚Äôs head.
‚Ä≠  In which affair, he sung in other place,
‚Ä≠  That of that ambush some man else did race
‚Ä≠  The Ilion tow‚Äôrs than Laertiades;
‚Ä≠  But here he sung, that he alone did seize,  [10]
‚Ä≠  With Menelaus, the ascended roof
‚Ä≠  Of prince Deiphobus, and Mars-like proof
‚Ä≠  Made of his valour, a most dreadful fight
‚Ä≠  Daring against him; and there vanquish‚Äôd quite,
‚Ä≠  In little time, by great Minerva‚Äôs aid,
‚Ä≠  All Ilion‚Äôs remnant, and Troy level laid.
‚Ä≠  This the divine expressor did so give
‚Ä≠  Both act and passion, that he made it live,
‚Ä≠  And to Ulysses‚Äô facts did breathe a fire
‚Ä≠  So deadly quick‚Äôning, that it did inspire  [11]
‚Ä≠  Old death with life, and render‚Äôd life so sweet,
‚Ä≠  And passionate, that all there felt it fleet;
‚Ä≠  Which made him pity his own cruelty,
‚Ä≠  And put into that ruth so pure an eye
‚Ä≠  Of human frailty, that to see a man
‚Ä≠  Could so revive from death, yet no way can
‚Ä≠  Defend from death, his own quick pow‚Äôrs it made
‚Ä≠  Feel there death‚Äôs horrors, and he felt life fade,
‚Ä≠  In tears his feeling brain swet; for, in things  [12]
‚Ä≠  That move past utt‚Äôrance, tears ope all their springs.
‚Ä≠  Nor are there in the pow‚Äôrs that all life bears
‚Ä≠  More true interpreters of all than tears.
‚Ä≠     And as a lady mourns her sole-lov‚Äôd lord,
‚Ä≠  That fall‚Äôn before his city by the sword,
‚Ä≠  Fighting to rescue from a cruel fate
‚Ä≠  His town and children, and in dead estate
‚Ä≠  Yet panting seeing him, wraps him in her arms,
‚Ä≠  Weeps, shrieks, and pours her health into his arms,
‚Ä≠  Lies on him, striving to become his shield
‚Ä≠  From foes that still assail him, spears impell‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Through back and shoulders, by whose points embrued,
‚Ä≠  They raise and lead him into servitude,
‚Ä≠  Labour, and languor; for all which the dame
‚Ä≠  Eats down her cheeks with tears, and feeds life‚Äôs flame
‚Ä≠  With miserable suff‚Äôrance; so this king
‚Ä≠  Of tear-swet anguish op‚Äôd a boundless spring;
‚Ä≠  Nor yet was seen to any one man there
‚Ä≠  But king Alcinous, who sat so near
‚Ä≠  He could not ‚Äòscape him, sighs, so chok‚Äôd, so brake
‚Ä≠  From all his tempers; which the king did take
‚Ä≠  Both note and grave respect of, and thus spake:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúHear me, Ph√¶acian councillors and peers,
‚Ä≠  And cease Demodocus; perhaps all ears
‚Ä≠  Are not delighted with his song, for, ever
‚Ä≠  Since the divine Muse sung, ‚Äòour guest hath never
‚Ä≠  Contain‚Äôd from secret mournings.  It may fall,
‚Ä≠  That something sung he hath been grieved with all,
‚Ä≠  As touching his particular.  Forbear,
‚Ä≠  That feast may jointly comfort all hearts here,
‚Ä≠  And we may cheer our guest up; ‚Äôtis our best
‚Ä≠  In all due honour.  For our rev‚Äôrend guest
‚Ä≠  Is all our celebration, gifts, and all,
‚Ä≠  His love hath added to our festival.
‚Ä≠  A guest, and suppliant too, we should esteem
‚Ä≠  Dear as our brother, one that doth but dream
‚Ä≠  He hath a soul, or touch but at a mind
‚Ä≠  Deathless and manly, should stand so inclin‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Nor cloak you longer with your curious wit,
‚Ä≠  Lov‚Äôd guest, what ever we shall ask of it.
‚Ä≠  It now stands on your honest state to tell,
‚Ä≠  And therefore give your name, nor more conceal
‚Ä≠  What of your parents, and the town that bears
‚Ä≠  Name of your native, or of foreigners
‚Ä≠  That near us border, you are call‚Äôd in fame.
‚Ä≠  There‚Äôs no man living walks without a name,
‚Ä≠  Noble nor base, but had one from his birth
‚Ä≠  Impos‚Äôd as fit as to be borne.  What earth,
‚Ä≠  People, and city, own you, give to know.
‚Ä≠  Tell but our ships all, that your way must show.
‚Ä≠  For our ships know th‚Äô expressed minds of men,
‚Ä≠  And will so most intentively retain
‚Ä≠  Their scopes appointed, that they never err,
‚Ä≠  And yet use never any man to steer,
‚Ä≠  Nor any rudders have, as others need.
‚Ä≠  They know men‚Äôs thoughts, and whither tends their speed,
‚Ä≠  And there will set them; for you cannot name  [13]
‚Ä≠  A city to them, nor fat soil, that Fame
‚Ä≠  Hath any notice giv‚Äôn, but well they know,
‚Ä≠  And they will fly to them, though they ebb and flow
‚Ä≠  In blackest clouds and nights; and never bear
‚Ä≠  Of any wrack or rock the slend‚Äôrest fear.
‚Ä≠  But this I heard my sire Nausithous say.
‚Ä≠  Long since, that Neptune, seeing us convey
‚Ä≠  So safely passengers of all degrees,
‚Ä≠  Was angry with us; and upon our seas
‚Ä≠  A well-built ship we had, near harbour come
‚Ä≠  From safe deduction of some stranger home,
‚Ä≠  Made in his flitting billows stick stone still;
‚Ä≠  And dimm‚Äôd our city, like a mighty hill
‚Ä≠  With shade cast round about it.  This report,
‚Ä≠  The old king made;  [14]  in which miraculous sort,
‚Ä≠  If God had done such things, or left undone,
‚Ä≠  At his good pleasure be it.  But now, on,
‚Ä≠  And truth relate us, both whence you err‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And to what clime of men would be transferr‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  With all their fair towns, be they as they are,
‚Ä≠  If rude, unjust, and all irregular,
‚Ä≠  Or hospitable, bearing minds that please
‚Ä≠  The mighty Deity.  Which one of these
‚Ä≠  You would be set at, say, and you are there.
‚Ä≠  And therefore what afflicts you?  Why, to hear
‚Ä≠  The fate of Greece and Ilion, mourn you so?
‚Ä≠  The Gods have done it; as to all they do
‚Ä≠  Destine destruction, that from thence may rise
‚Ä≠  A poem to instruct posterities.
‚Ä≠  Fell any kinsman before Ilion?
‚Ä≠  Some worthy sire-in-law, or like-near son,
‚Ä≠  Whom next our own blood and self-race we love?
‚Ä≠  Or any friend perhaps, in whom did move
‚Ä≠  A knowing soul, and no unpleasing thing?
‚Ä≠  Since such a good one is no underling
‚Ä≠  To any brother; for, what fits true friends,
‚Ä≠  True wisdom is, that blood and birth transcends.

‚Ä≠  THE NINTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Ulysses here is first made known;
‚Ä≠  Who tells the stern contention
‚Ä≠  His pow‚Äôrs did ‚Äôgainst the Cicons try;
‚Ä≠  And thence to the Lotophagi
‚Ä≠  Extends his conquest; and from them
‚Ä≠  Assays the Cyclop Polypheme,
‚Ä≠  And, by the crafts his wits apply,
‚Ä≠  He puts him out his only eye.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _·æøŒôœâÃëœÑŒ±._
‚Ä≠     The strangely fed
‚Ä≠        Lotophagi.
‚Ä≠     The Cicons fled.
‚Ä≠        The Cyclop‚Äôs eye.

‚Ä≠  Ulysses thus resolv‚Äôd the king‚Äôs demands:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAlcinous, in whom this empire stands,
‚Ä≠  You should not of so natural right disherit
‚Ä≠  Your princely feast, as take from it the spirit.
‚Ä≠  To hear a poet, that in accent brings
‚Ä≠  The Gods‚Äô breasts down, and breathes them as he sings,
‚Ä≠  Is sweet, and sacred; nor can I conceive,
‚Ä≠  In any common-weal, what more doth give
‚Ä≠  Note of the just and blessed empery,
‚Ä≠  Than to see comfort universally
‚Ä≠  Cheer up the people, when in ev‚Äôry roof
‚Ä≠  She gives observers a most human proof
‚Ä≠  Of men‚Äôs contents. To see a neighbour‚Äôs feast
‚Ä≠  Adorn it through; and thereat hear the breast
‚Ä≠  Of the divine Muse; men in order set;
‚Ä≠  A wine-page waiting; tables crown‚Äôd with meat,
‚Ä≠  Set close to guests that are to use it skill‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  The cup-boards furnish‚Äôd, and the cups still fill‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  This shows, to my mind, most humanely fair.
‚Ä≠  Nor should you, for me, still the heav‚Äônly air,
‚Ä≠  That stirr‚Äôd my soul so; for I love such tears
‚Ä≠  As fall from fit notes, beaten through mine ears
‚Ä≠  With repetitions of what heav‚Äôn hath done,
‚Ä≠  And break from hearty apprehensi√≥n
‚Ä≠  Of God and goodness, though they show my ill.
‚Ä≠  And therefore doth my mind excite me still,
‚Ä≠  To tell my bleeding moan; but much more now,
‚Ä≠  To serve your pleasure, that to over-flow
‚Ä≠  My tears with such cause may by sighs be driv‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  Though ne‚Äôer so much plagued I may seem by heav‚Äôn.
‚Ä≠     And now my name; which way shall lead to all
‚Ä≠  My mis‚Äôries after, that their sounds may fall
‚Ä≠  Through your ears also, and show (having fled
‚Ä≠  So much affliction) first, who rests his head
‚Ä≠  In your embraces, when, so far from home,
‚Ä≠  I knew not where t‚Äô obtain it resting room.
‚Ä≠     I am Ulysses Laertiades,
‚Ä≠  The fear of all the world for policies,
‚Ä≠  For which my facts as high as heav‚Äôn resound.
‚Ä≠  I dwell in Ithaca, earth‚Äôs most renown‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  All over-shadow‚Äôd with the shake-leaf hill,  [1]
‚Ä≠  Tree-fam‚Äôd Neritus; whose near confines fill
‚Ä≠  Islands a number, well-inhabited,
‚Ä≠  That under my observance taste their bread;
‚Ä≠  Dulichius, Samos, and the full-of-food  [2]
‚Ä≠  Zacynthus, likewise grac‚Äôd with store of wood.
‚Ä≠  But Ithaca, though in the seas it lie,
‚Ä≠  Yet lies she so aloft she casts her eye
‚Ä≠  Quite over all the neighbour continent;
‚Ä≠  Far northward situate, and, being lent
‚Ä≠  But little favour of the morn and sun,
‚Ä≠  With barren rocks and cliffs is over-run;
‚Ä≠  And yet of hardy youths a nurse of name;
‚Ä≠  Nor could I see a soil, where‚Äôer I came,
‚Ä≠  More sweet and wishful.  Yet, from hence was I
‚Ä≠  Withheld with horror by the Deity,
‚Ä≠  Divine Calypso, in her cavy house,
‚Ä≠  Enflam‚Äôd to make me her sole lord and spouse.
‚Ä≠  Circe √Ü√¶a too, that knowing dame,
‚Ä≠  Whose veins the like affections did enflame,
‚Ä≠  Detain‚Äôd me likewise.  But to neither‚Äôs love
‚Ä≠  Could I be tempted;  which doth well approve,
‚Ä≠  Nothing so sweet is as our country‚Äôs earth,  [3]
‚Ä≠  And joy of those from whom we claim our birth.
‚Ä≠  Though roofs far richer we far off possess,
‚Ä≠  Yet, from our native, all our more is less.
‚Ä≠     To which as I contended, I will tell
‚Ä≠  The much-distress-conferring facts that fell
‚Ä≠  By Jove‚Äôs divine prevention, since I set
‚Ä≠  From ruin‚Äôd Troy my first foot in retreat.
‚Ä≠     From Ilion ill winds cast me on the coast
‚Ä≠  The Cicons hold, where I employ‚Äôd mine host
‚Ä≠  For Ismarus, a city built just by
‚Ä≠  My place of landing; of which victory
‚Ä≠  Made me expugner.  I depeopled it,
‚Ä≠  Slew all the men, and did their wives remit,
‚Ä≠  With much spoil taken; which we did divide,
‚Ä≠  That none might need his part.  I then applied
‚Ä≠  All speed for flight; but my command therein,
‚Ä≠  Fools that they were, could no observance win
‚Ä≠  Of many soldiers, who, with spoil fed high,
‚Ä≠  Would yet fill higher, and excessively
‚Ä≠  Fell to their wine, gave slaughter on the shore
‚Ä≠  Clov‚Äôn-footed beeves and sheep in mighty store.
‚Ä≠  In mean space, Cicons did to Cicons cry,
‚Ä≠  When, of their nearest dwellers, instantly
‚Ä≠  Many and better soldiers made strong head,
‚Ä≠  That held the continent, and manag√©d
‚Ä≠  Their horse with high skill, on which they would fight,
‚Ä≠  When fittest cause serv‚Äôd, and again alight,
‚Ä≠  With soon seen vantage, and on foot contend.
‚Ä≠  Their concourse swift was, and had never end;
‚Ä≠  As thick and sudden ‚Äôtwas, as flow‚Äôrs and leaves
‚Ä≠  Dark spring discovers, when she light receives.  [4]
‚Ä≠  And then began the bitter Fate of Jove
‚Ä≠  To alter us unhappy, which ev‚Äôn strove
‚Ä≠  To give us suff‚Äôrance.  At our fleet we made
‚Ä≠  Enforc√©d stand; and there did they invade
‚Ä≠  Our thrust-up forces; darts encounter‚Äôd darts,
‚Ä≠  With blows on both sides; either making parts
‚Ä≠  Good upon either, while the morning shone,
‚Ä≠  And sacred day her bright increase held on,
‚Ä≠  Though much out-match‚Äôd in number; but as soon
‚Ä≠  As Ph≈ìbus westward fell, the Cicons won
‚Ä≠  Much hand of us; six proved soldiers fell,
‚Ä≠  Of ev‚Äôry ship, the rest they did compel!
‚Ä≠  To seek of Flight escape from Death and Fate.

‚Ä≠     Thence sad in heart we sail‚Äôd; and yet our state
‚Ä≠  Was something cheer‚Äôd, that (being o‚Äôer-match‚Äôd so much
‚Ä≠  In violent number) our retreat was such
‚Ä≠  As sav‚Äôd so many.  Our dear loss the less,
‚Ä≠  That they surviv‚Äôd, so like for like success.
‚Ä≠  Yet left we not the coast, before we call‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Home to our country-earth the souls exhal‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of all the friends the Cicons overcame.
‚Ä≠  Thrice call‚Äôd we on them by their sev‚Äôral name,  [5]
‚Ä≠  And then took leave.  Then from the angry North
‚Ä≠  Cloud-gath‚Äôring Jove a dreadful storm call‚Äôd forth
‚Ä≠  Against our navy, cover‚Äôd shore and all
‚Ä≠  With gloomy vapours.  Night did headlong fall
‚Ä≠  From frowning heav‚Äôn.  And then hurl‚Äôd here and there
‚Ä≠  Was all our navy; the rude winds did tear
‚Ä≠  In three, in four parts, all their sails; and down
‚Ä≠  Driv‚Äôn under hatches were we, prest to drown.
‚Ä≠  Up rush‚Äôd we yet again, and with tough hand
‚Ä≠  (Two days, two nights, entoil‚Äôd) we gat near land,
‚Ä≠  Labours and sorrows eating up our minds.
‚Ä≠  The third clear day yet, to more friendly winds
‚Ä≠  We masts advanc‚Äôd, we white sails spread, and sate.
‚Ä≠  Forewinds and guides again did iterate
‚Ä≠  Our ease and home-hopes; which we clear had reach‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Had not, by chance, a sudden north-wind fetch‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  With an extreme sea, quite about again
‚Ä≠  Our whole endeavours, and our course constrain
‚Ä≠  To giddy round, and with our bow‚Äôd sails greet
‚Ä≠  Dreadful Maleia, calling back our fleet
‚Ä≠  As far forth as Cythera.  Nine days more
‚Ä≠  Adverse winds toss‚Äôd me; and the tenth, the shore,
‚Ä≠  Where dwelt the blossom-fed Lotophagi,
‚Ä≠  I fetch‚Äôd, fresh water took in, instantly
‚Ä≠  Fell to our food aship-board, and then sent
‚Ä≠  Two of my choice men to the continent
‚Ä≠  (Adding a third, a herald) to discover
‚Ä≠  What sort of people were the rulers over
‚Ä≠  The land next to us.  Where, the first they met,
‚Ä≠  Were the Lotophagi, that made them eat
‚Ä≠  Their country-diet, and no ill intent
‚Ä≠  Hid in their hearts to them; and yet th‚Äô event
‚Ä≠  To ill converted it, for having eat
‚Ä≠  Their dainty viands, they did quite forget
‚Ä≠  (As all men else that did but taste their feast)
‚Ä≠  Both countrymen and country, nor addrest
‚Ä≠  Any return t‚Äô inform what sort of men
‚Ä≠  Made fix‚Äôd abode there, but would needs maintain
‚Ä≠  Abode themselves there, and eat that food ever.
‚Ä≠  I made out after, and was feign to sever
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô enchanted knot by forcing their retreat;
‚Ä≠  That striv‚Äôd, and wept, and would not leave their meat
‚Ä≠  For heav‚Äôn itself.  But, dragging them to fleet,
‚Ä≠  I wrapt in sure bands both their hands and feet,
‚Ä≠  And cast them under hatches, and away
‚Ä≠  Commanded all the rest without least stay,
‚Ä≠  Lest they should taste the lote too, and forget
‚Ä≠  With such strange raptures their despis‚Äôd retreat.
‚Ä≠     All then aboard, we beat the sea with oars,
‚Ä≠  And still with sad hearts sail‚Äôd by out-way shores,
‚Ä≠  Till th‚Äô out-law‚Äôd Cyclops‚Äô land we fetch‚Äôd; a race
‚Ä≠  Of proud-liv‚Äôd loiterers, that never sow,
‚Ä≠  Nor put a plant in earth, nor use a plow,
‚Ä≠  But trust in God for all things; and their earth,
‚Ä≠  Unsown, unplow‚Äôd, gives ev‚Äôry offspring birth
‚Ä≠  That other lands have; wheat, and barley, vines
‚Ä≠  That bear in goodly grapes delicious wines;
‚Ä≠  And Jove sends show‚Äôrs for all.   No councils there,
‚Ä≠  Nor councillors, nor laws; but all men bear
‚Ä≠  Their heads aloft on mountains, and those steep,
‚Ä≠  And on their tops too; and their houses keep
‚Ä≠  In vaulty caves, their households govern‚Äôd all
‚Ä≠  By each man‚Äôs law, impos‚Äôd in several,
‚Ä≠  Nor wife, nor child awed, but as he thinks good,
‚Ä≠  None for another caring.  But there stood
‚Ä≠  Another little isle, well stor‚Äôd with wood,
‚Ä≠  Betwixt this and the entry; neither nigh
‚Ä≠  The Cyclops‚Äô isle, nor yet far off doth lie,
‚Ä≠  Men‚Äôs want it suffer‚Äôd, but the men‚Äôs supplies
‚Ä≠  The goats made with their inarticulate cries.
‚Ä≠  Goats beyond number this small island breeds,
‚Ä≠  So tame, that no access disturbs their feeds,
‚Ä≠  No hunters, that the tops of mountains scale,
‚Ä≠  And rub through woods with toil, seek them at all.
‚Ä≠  Nor is the soil with flocks fed down, not plow‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Nor ever in it any seed was sow‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Nor place the neighbour Cyclops their delights
‚Ä≠  In brave vermilion-prow-deck‚Äôd ships; nor wrights
‚Ä≠  Useful, and skilful in such works as need
‚Ä≠  Perfection to those traffics that exceed
‚Ä≠  Their natural confines, to fly out and see
‚Ä≠  Cities of men, and take in mutually
‚Ä≠  The prease of others; to themselves they live,
‚Ä≠  And to their island that enough would give
‚Ä≠  A good inhabitant; and time of year
‚Ä≠  Observe to all things art could order there.
‚Ä≠  There, close upon the sea, sweet meadows spring;
‚Ä≠  That yet of fresh streams want no watering
‚Ä≠  To their soft burthens, but of special yield.
‚Ä≠  Your vines would be there; and your common field
‚Ä≠  But gentle work make for your plow, yet bear
‚Ä≠  A lofty harvest when you came to shear;
‚Ä≠  For passing fat the soil is.  In it lies
‚Ä≠  A harbour so opp√≥rtune, that no ties,
‚Ä≠  Halsers, or gables need, nor anchors cast.
‚Ä≠  Whom storms put in there are with stay embrac‚Äôd,  [6]
‚Ä≠  Or to their full wills safe, or winds aspire
‚Ä≠  To pilots‚Äô uses their more quick desire.
‚Ä≠  At entry of the haven, a silver ford
‚Ä≠  Is from a rock-impressing fountain pour‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  All set with sable poplars.  And this port
‚Ä≠  Were we arriv‚Äôd at, by the sweet resort
‚Ä≠  Of some God guiding us, for ‚Äôtwas a night
‚Ä≠  So ghastly dark all port was past our sight,
‚Ä≠  Clouds hid our ships, and would not let the moon
‚Ä≠  Afford a beam to us, the whole isle won
‚Ä≠  By not an eye of ours.  None thought the blore,
‚Ä≠  That then was up, shov‚Äôd waves‚Äô against the shore,
‚Ä≠  That then to an unmeasur‚Äôd height put on;
‚Ä≠  We still at sea esteem‚Äôd us, till alone
‚Ä≠  Our fleet put in itself.  And then were strook
‚Ä≠  Our gather‚Äôd sails; our rest ashore we took,
‚Ä≠  And day expected.  When the morn gave fire,
‚Ä≠  We rose, and walk‚Äôd, and did the isle admire;
‚Ä≠  The Nymphs, Jove‚Äôs daughters, putting up a herd
‚Ä≠  Of mountain goats to us, to render cheer‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  My fellow soldiers.  To our fleet we flew,
‚Ä≠  Our crooked bows took, long-pil‚Äôd darts, and drew
‚Ä≠  Ourselves in three parts out; when, by the grace
‚Ä≠  That God vouchsaf‚Äôd, we made a gainful chace.
‚Ä≠  Twelve ships we had, and ev‚Äôry ship had nine
‚Ä≠  Fat goats allotted [it], ten only mine.
‚Ä≠  Thus all that day, ev‚Äôn till the sun was set,
‚Ä≠  We sat and feasted, pleasant wine and meat
‚Ä≠  Plenteously taking; for we had not spent
‚Ä≠  Our ruddy wine aship-board, supplement
‚Ä≠  Of large sort each man to his vessel drew,
‚Ä≠  When we the sacred city overthrew
‚Ä≠  That held the Cicons.  Now then saw we near
‚Ä≠  The Cyclops‚Äô late-prais‚Äôd island, and might hear
‚Ä≠  The murmur of their sheep and goats, and see
‚Ä≠  Their smokes ascend.  The sun then set, and we,
‚Ä≠  When night succeeded, took our rest ashore.
‚Ä≠  And when the world the morning‚Äôs favour wore,
‚Ä≠  I call‚Äôd my friends to council, charging them
‚Ä≠  To make stay there, while I took ship and stream,
‚Ä≠  With some associates, and explor‚Äôd what men
‚Ä≠  The neighbour isle held; if of rude disdain,
‚Ä≠  Churlish and tyrannous, or minds bewray‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Pious and hospitable.  Thus much said,
‚Ä≠  I boarded, and commanded to ascend
‚Ä≠  My friends and soldiers, to put off, and lend
‚Ä≠  Way to our ship.  They boarded, sat, and beat
‚Ä≠  The old sea forth, till we might see the seat
‚Ä≠  The greatest Cyclop held for his abode,
‚Ä≠  Which was a deep cave, near the common road
‚Ä≠  Of ships that touch‚Äôd there, thick with laurels spread,
‚Ä≠  Where many sheep and goats lay shadow√©d;
‚Ä≠  And, near to this, a hall of torn-up stone,
‚Ä≠  High built with pines, that heav‚Äôn and earth attone,
‚Ä≠  And lofty-fronted oaks; in which kept house
‚Ä≠  A man in shape immane, and monsterous,
‚Ä≠  Fed all his flocks alone, nor would afford
‚Ä≠  Commerce with men, but had a wit abhorr‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  His mind his body answ‚Äôring.  Nor was he
‚Ä≠  Like any man that food could possibly
‚Ä≠  Enhance so hugely, but, beheld alone,
‚Ä≠  Show‚Äôd like a steep hill‚Äôs top, all overgrown
‚Ä≠  With trees and brambles;  little thought had I
‚Ä≠  Of such vast objects.  When, arriv‚Äôd so nigh,
‚Ä≠  Some of my lov‚Äôd friends I made stay aboard,
‚Ä≠  To guard my ship;  and twelve with me I shor‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  The choice of all.  I took besides along
‚Ä≠  A goat-skin flagon of wine, black and strong,
‚Ä≠  That Maro did present, Evantheus‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  And priest to Ph≈ìbus, who had mansi√≥n
‚Ä≠  In Thracian Ismarus (the town I took).
‚Ä≠  He gave it me, since I (with rev‚Äôrence strook
‚Ä≠  Of his grave place, his wife and children‚Äôs good)
‚Ä≠  Freed all of violence.  Amidst a wood,
‚Ä≠  Sacred to Ph≈ìbus, stood his house; from whence
‚Ä≠  He fetch‚Äôd me gifts of varied excellence;
‚Ä≠  Sev‚Äôn talents of fine gold; a bowl all fram‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of massy silver; but his gift most fam‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Was twelve great vessels, fill‚Äôd with such rich wine
‚Ä≠  As was incorruptible and divine.
‚Ä≠  He kept it as his jewel, which none knew
‚Ä≠  But he himself, his wife, and he that drew.
‚Ä≠  It was so strong that never any fill‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A cup, where that was but by drops instill‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And drunk it off, but ‚Äôtwas before allay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With twenty parts in water; yet so sway‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The spirit of that little, that the whole
‚Ä≠  A sacred odour breath‚Äôd about the bowl.
‚Ä≠  Had you the odour smelt and scent it cast,
‚Ä≠  It would have vex‚Äôd you to forbear the taste.
‚Ä≠  But then, the taste gain‚Äôd too, the spirit it wrought
‚Ä≠  To dare things high set-up-an-end my thought.
‚Ä≠     Of this a huge great flagon full I bore,
‚Ä≠  And, in a good large knapsack, victuals store;
‚Ä≠  And long‚Äôd to see this heap of fortitude,
‚Ä≠  That so illit‚Äôrate was and upland rude
‚Ä≠  That laws divine nor human he had learn‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  With speed we reach‚Äôd the cavern; nor discern‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His presence there, his flocks he fed at field.
‚Ä≠     Ent‚Äôring his den, each thing beheld did yield
‚Ä≠  Our admiration; shelves with cheeses heap‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  Sheds stuff‚Äôd with lambs and goats, distinctly kept,
‚Ä≠  Distinct the biggest, the more mean distinct,
‚Ä≠  Distinct the youngest.  And in their precinct,
‚Ä≠  Proper and placeful, stood the troughs and pails,
‚Ä≠  In which he milk‚Äôd; and what was giv‚Äôn at meals,
‚Ä≠  Set up a creaming; in the ev‚Äôning still
‚Ä≠  All scouring bright as dew upon the hill.
‚Ä≠     Then were my fellows instant to convey
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúKids, cheeses, lambs, aship-board, and away
‚Ä≠  Sail the salt billow.  I thought best not so,
‚Ä≠  But better otherwise; and first would know,
‚Ä≠  What guest-gifts he would spare me.  Little knew
‚Ä≠  My friends on whom they would have prey‚Äôd.  His view
‚Ä≠  Prov‚Äôd after, that his inwards were too rough
‚Ä≠  For such bold usage.  We were bold enough
‚Ä≠  In what I suffer‚Äôd; which was there to stay,
‚Ä≠  Make fire and feed there, though bear none away.
‚Ä≠  There sat we, till we saw him feeding come,
‚Ä≠  And on his neck a burthen lugging home,
‚Ä≠  Most highly huge, of sere-wood, which the pile
‚Ä≠  That fed his fire supplied all supper-while.
‚Ä≠  Down by his den he threw it, and up rose
‚Ä≠  A tumult with the fall.  Afraid, we close
‚Ä≠  Withdrew ourselves, while he into a cave
‚Ä≠  Of huge receipt his high-fed cattle drave,
‚Ä≠  All that he milk‚Äôd; the males he left without
‚Ä≠  His lofty roofs, that all bestrow‚Äôd about
‚Ä≠  With rams and buck-goats were.  And then a rock
‚Ä≠  He lift aloft, that damm‚Äôd up to his flock
‚Ä≠  The door they enter‚Äôd; ‚Äôtwas so hard to wield,
‚Ä≠  That two-and-twenty waggons, all four-wheel‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  (Could they be loaded, and have teams that were
‚Ä≠  Proportion‚Äôd to them) could not stir it there.
‚Ä≠  Thus making sure, he kneel‚Äôd and milk‚Äôd his ewes,
‚Ä≠  And braying goats, with all a milker‚Äôs dues;
‚Ä≠  Then let in all their young.  Then quick did dress
‚Ä≠  His half milk up for cheese, and in a press
‚Ä≠  Of wicker press‚Äôd it; put in bowls the rest,
‚Ä≠  To drink and eat, and serve his supping feast.
‚Ä≠     All works dispatch‚Äôd thus, he began his fire;
‚Ä≠  Which blown, he saw us, and did thus inquire:
‚Ä≠     ·øæHo! guests!  What are ye?  Whence sail ye these seas?
‚Ä≠  Traffic, or rove ye, and like thieves oppress
‚Ä≠  Poor strange adventurers, exposing so
‚Ä≠  Your souls to danger, and your lives to woe?‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This utter‚Äôd he, when fear from our hearts took
‚Ä≠  The very life, to be so thunder-strook
‚Ä≠  With such a voice, and such a monster see;
‚Ä≠  But thus I answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄòErring Grecians, we
‚Ä≠  From Troy were turning homewards, but by force
‚Ä≠  Of adverse winds, in far diverted course,
‚Ä≠  Such unknown ways took, and on rude seas toss‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  As Jove decreed, are cast upon this coast,
‚Ä≠  Of Agamemnon, famous Atreus‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  We boast ourselves the soldiers; who hath won  [7]
‚Ä≠  Renown that reacheth heav‚Äôn, to overthrow
‚Ä≠  So great a city, and to ruin so
‚Ä≠  So many nations.  Yet at thy knees lie
‚Ä≠  Our prostrate bosoms, forc‚Äôd with pray‚Äôrs to try
‚Ä≠  If any hospitable right, or boon
‚Ä≠  Of other nature, such as have been won
‚Ä≠  By laws of other houses, thou wilt give.
‚Ä≠  Rev‚Äôrence the Gods, thou great‚Äôst of all that live.
‚Ä≠  We suppliants are; and hospitable Jove
‚Ä≠  Pours wreak on all whom pray‚Äôrs want pow‚Äôr to move,
‚Ä≠  And with their plagues together will provide
‚Ä≠  That humble guests shall have their wants supplied.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     He cruelly answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄòO thou fool,‚Äô  said he,
‚Ä≠  To come so far, and to importune me
‚Ä≠  With any God‚Äôs fear, or observ√©d love!
‚Ä≠  We Cyclops care not for your goat-fed Jove,
‚Ä≠  Nor other Bless‚Äôd ones; we are better far.
‚Ä≠  To Jove himself dare I bid open war,
‚Ä≠  To thee, and all thy fellows, if I please.
‚Ä≠  But tell me, where‚Äôs the ship, that by the seas
‚Ä≠  Hath brought thee hither?  If far off, or near,
‚Ä≠  Inform me quickly.‚Äô  These his temptings were;
‚Ä≠  But I too much knew not to know his mind,
‚Ä≠  And craft with craft paid, telling him the wind
‚Ä≠  (Thrust up from sea by Him that shakes the shore)
‚Ä≠  Had dash‚Äôd our ships against his rocks, and tore
‚Ä≠  Her ribs in pieces close upon his coast,
‚Ä≠  And we from high wrack sav‚Äôd, the rest were lost.
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd nothing, but rush‚Äôd in, and took
‚Ä≠  Two of my fellows up from earth, and strook
‚Ä≠  Their brains against it.  Like two whelps they flew
‚Ä≠  About his shoulders, and did all embrue
‚Ä≠  The blushing earth.  No mountain lion tore
‚Ä≠  Two lambs so sternly, lapp‚Äôd up all their gore
‚Ä≠  Gush‚Äôd from their torn-up bodies, limb by limb
‚Ä≠  (Trembling with life yet) ravish‚Äôd into him.
‚Ä≠  Both flesh and marrow-stuff√©d bones he eat,
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôn th‚Äô uncleans√©d entrails made his meat.
‚Ä≠  We, weeping, cast our hands to heav‚Äôn, to view
‚Ä≠  A sight so horrid.  Desperation flew,
‚Ä≠  With all our after lives, to instant death,
‚Ä≠  In our believ‚Äôd destruction.  But when breath
‚Ä≠  The fury of his appetite had got,
‚Ä≠  Because the gulf his belly reach‚Äôd his throat,
‚Ä≠  Man‚Äôs flesh, and goat‚Äôs milk, laying lay‚Äôr on lay‚Äôr,
‚Ä≠  Till near chok‚Äôd up was all the pass for air,
‚Ä≠  Along his den, among‚Äôst his cattle, down
‚Ä≠  He rush‚Äôd, and streak‚Äôd him.  ‚ÄòWhen my mind was grown
‚Ä≠  Desp‚Äôrate to step in, draw my sword, and part
‚Ä≠  His bosom where the strings about the heart
‚Ä≠  Circle the liver, and add strength of hand.
‚Ä≠  But that rash thought, more stay‚Äôd, did countermand,
‚Ä≠  For there we all had perish‚Äôd, since it past
‚Ä≠  Our pow‚Äôrs to lift aside a log so vast,
‚Ä≠  As barr‚Äôd all outscape; and so sigh‚Äôd away
‚Ä≠  The thought all night, expecting active day.
‚Ä≠  Which come, he first of all his fire enflames,
‚Ä≠  Then milks his goats and ewes, then to their dams
‚Ä≠  Lets in their young, and, wondrous orderly,
‚Ä≠  With manly haste dispatch‚Äôd his housewif‚Äôry.
‚Ä≠  Then to his breakfast, to which other two
‚Ä≠  Of my poor friends went; which eat, out then go
‚Ä≠  His herds and fat flocks, lightly putting by
‚Ä≠  The churlish bar, and clos‚Äôd it instantly;
‚Ä≠  For both those works with ease as much he did,
‚Ä≠  As you would ope and shut your quiver lid.
‚Ä≠     With storms of whistlings then his flock he drave
‚Ä≠  Up to the mountains; and occasion gave
‚Ä≠  For me to use my wits, which to their height
‚Ä≠  I striv‚Äôd to screw up, that a vengeance might
‚Ä≠  By some means fall from thence, and Pallas now
‚Ä≠  Afford a full ear to my neediest vow.
‚Ä≠  This then my thoughts preferr‚Äôd: A huge club lay
‚Ä≠  Close by his milk-house, which was now in way
‚Ä≠  To dry and season, being an olive-tree
‚Ä≠  Which late he fell‚Äôd, and, being green, must be
‚Ä≠  Made lighter for his manage.  ‚ÄôTwas so vast,
‚Ä≠  That we resembled it to some fit mast,
‚Ä≠  To serve a ship of burthen that was driv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  With twenty oars, and had a bigness giv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  To bear a huge sea.  Full so thick, so tall,
‚Ä≠  We judg‚Äôd this club; which I, in part, hew‚Äôd small,
‚Ä≠  And cut a fathom off.  The piece I gave
‚Ä≠  Amongst my soldiers, to take down, and shave;
‚Ä≠  Which done, I sharpen‚Äôd it at top, and then,
‚Ä≠  Harden‚Äôd in fire, I hid it in the den
‚Ä≠  Within a nasty dunghill reeking there,
‚Ä≠  Thick, and so moist it issued ev‚Äôrywhere.
‚Ä≠  Then made I lots cast by my friends to try
‚Ä≠  Whose fortune serv‚Äôd to dare the bor‚Äôd-out eye
‚Ä≠  Of that man-eater; and the lot did fall
‚Ä≠  On four I wish‚Äôd to make my aid of all,
‚Ä≠  And I the fifth made, chosen like the rest.
‚Ä≠     Then came the even, and he came from the feast
‚Ä≠  Of his fat cattle, drave in all; nor kept
‚Ä≠  One male abroad; if, or his memory slept
‚Ä≠  By Gods‚Äô direct will, or of purpose was
‚Ä≠  His driving in of all then, doth surpass
‚Ä≠  My comprehension.  But he clos‚Äôd again
‚Ä≠  The mighty bar, milk‚Äôd, and did still maintain
‚Ä≠  All other observation as before.
‚Ä≠  His work all done, two of my soldiers more
‚Ä≠  At once he snatch‚Äôd up, and to supper went.
‚Ä≠  Then dar‚Äôd I words to him, and did present
‚Ä≠  A bowl of wine, with these words:  ‚ÄòCyclop!  take
‚Ä≠  A bowl of wine, from my hand, that may make
‚Ä≠  Way for the man‚Äôs flesh thou hast eat, and show
‚Ä≠  What drink our ship held; which in sacred vow
‚Ä≠  I offer to thee to take ruth on me
‚Ä≠  In my dismission home.  Thy rages be
‚Ä≠  Now no more sufferable.  How shall men,
‚Ä≠  Mad and inhuman that thou art, again
‚Ä≠  Greet thy abode, and get thy actions grace,
‚Ä≠  If thus thou ragest, and eat‚Äôst up their race.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     He took, and drunk, and vehemently joy‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To taste the sweet cup; and again employ‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  My flagon‚Äôs pow‚Äôrs, entreating more, and said:
‚Ä≠  ·øæGood guest, again afford my taste thy aid,
‚Ä≠  And let me know thy name, and quickly now,
‚Ä≠  That in thy recompense I may bestow
‚Ä≠  A hospitable gift on thy desert,
‚Ä≠  And such a one as shall rejoice thy heart.
‚Ä≠  For to the Cyclops too the gentle earth
‚Ä≠  Bears gen‚Äôrous wine, and Jove augments her birth,
‚Ä≠  In store of such, with show‚Äôrs; but this rich wine
‚Ä≠  Fell from the river, that is mere divine,
‚Ä≠  Of nectar and ambrosia.‚Äô  This again
‚Ä≠  I gave him, and again; nor could the fool abstain,
‚Ä≠  But drunk as often.  When the noble juice
‚Ä≠  Had wrought upon his spirit, I then gave use
‚Ä≠  To fairer language, saying: ‚ÄòCyclop! now,
‚Ä≠  As thou demand‚Äôst, I‚Äôll tell my name, do thou
‚Ä≠  Make good thy hospitable gift to me.
‚Ä≠  My name is No-Man;  No-Man each degree
‚Ä≠  Of friends, as well as parents, call my name.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  He answer‚Äôd, as his cruel soul became:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòNo-Man!  I‚Äôll eat thee last of all thy friends;
‚Ä≠  And this is that in which so much amends
‚Ä≠  I vow‚Äôd to thy deservings, thus shall be
‚Ä≠  My hospitable gift made good to thee.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  This said, he upwards fell, but then bent round
‚Ä≠  His fleshy neck; and Sleep, with all crowns crown‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Subdued the savage.  From his throat brake out
‚Ä≠  My wine, with man‚Äôs-flesh gobbets, like a spout,
‚Ä≠  When, loaded with his cups, he lay and snor‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  And then took I the club‚Äôs end up, and gor‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The burning coal-heap, that the point might heat;
‚Ä≠  Confirm‚Äôd my fellow‚Äôs minds, lest Fear should let
‚Ä≠  Their vow‚Äôd assay, and make them fly my aid.
‚Ä≠  Straight was the olive-lever, I had laid
‚Ä≠  Amidst the huge fire to get hard‚Äôning, hot,
‚Ä≠  And glow‚Äôd extremely, though ‚Äôtwas green; which got
‚Ä≠  From forth the cinders, close about me stood
‚Ä≠  My hardy friends; but that which did the good
‚Ä≠  Was God‚Äôs good inspirati√≥n, that gave
‚Ä≠  A spirit beyond the spirit they us‚Äôd to have;
‚Ä≠  Who took the olive spar, made keen before,
‚Ä≠  And plung‚Äôd it in his eye, and up I bore,
‚Ä≠  Bent to the top close, and help‚Äôd pour it in,
‚Ä≠  With all my forces.  And as you have seen
‚Ä≠  A ship-wright bore a naval beam, he oft
‚Ä≠  Thrusts at the auger‚Äôs froofe, works still aloft,
‚Ä≠  And at the shank help others, with a cord
‚Ä≠  Wound round about to make it sooner bor‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  All plying the round still; so into his eye
‚Ä≠  The fiery stake we labour‚Äôd to imply.
‚Ä≠  Out gush‚Äôd the blood that scalded, his eye-ball
‚Ä≠  Thrust out a flaming vapour, that scorch‚Äôd all
‚Ä≠  His brows and eye-lids, his eye-strings did crack,
‚Ä≠  As in the sharp and burning rafter brake.
‚Ä≠  And as a smith, to harden any tool,
‚Ä≠  Broad axe, or mattock, in his trough doth cool
‚Ä≠  The red-hot substance, that so fervent is
‚Ä≠  It makes the cold wave straight to seethe and hiss;
‚Ä≠  So sod and hiss‚Äôd his eye about the stake.
‚Ä≠  He roar‚Äôd withal, and all his cavern brake
‚Ä≠  In claps like thunder.  We did frighted fly,
‚Ä≠  Dispers‚Äôd in corners.  He from forth his eye
‚Ä≠  The fixed stake pluck‚Äôd; after which the blood
‚Ä≠  Flow‚Äôd freshly forth; and, mad, he hurl‚Äôd the wood
‚Ä≠  About his hovel.  Out he then did cry
‚Ä≠  For other Cyclops, that in caverns by
‚Ä≠  Upon a windy promontory dwell‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  Who, hearing how impetuously he yell‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Rush‚Äôd ev‚Äôry way about him, and inquir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  What ill afflicted him, that he exspir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Such horrid clamours, and in sacred Night
‚Ä≠  To break their sleeps so?  Ask‚Äôd him, if his fright
‚Ä≠  Came from some mortal that his flocks had driv‚Äôn?
‚Ä≠  Or if by craft, or might, his death were giv‚Äôn?
‚Ä≠  He answer‚Äôd from his den:  ‚ÄòBy craft, nor might,
‚Ä≠  No-Man hath giv‚Äôn me death.‚Äô  They then said right,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòIf no man hurt thee, and thyself alone,
‚Ä≠  That which is done to thee by Jove is done;
‚Ä≠  And what great Jove inflicts no man can fly.
‚Ä≠  Pray to thy Father yet, a Deity,
‚Ä≠  And prove, from him if thou canst help acquire.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     Thus spake they, leaving him; when all-on-fire
‚Ä≠  My heart with joy was, that so well my wit
‚Ä≠  And name deceiv‚Äôd him; whom now pain did split,
‚Ä≠  And groaning up and down he groping tried
‚Ä≠  To find the stone, which found, he put aside;
‚Ä≠  But in the door sat, feeling if he could
‚Ä≠  (As his sheep issued) on some man lay hold;
‚Ä≠  Esteeming me a fool, that could devise
‚Ä≠  No stratagem to ‚Äòscape his gross surprise.
‚Ä≠  But I, contending what I could invent
‚Ä≠  My friends and me from death so eminent
‚Ä≠  To get deliver‚Äôd, all my wiles I wove
‚Ä≠  (Life being the subject) and did this approve:
‚Ä≠  Fat fleecy rams, most fair, and great, lay there,
‚Ä≠  That did a burden like a violet bear.  [8]
‚Ä≠  These, while this learn‚Äôd-in-villainy did sleep,
‚Ä≠  I yok‚Äôd with osiers cut there, sheep to sheep,
‚Ä≠  Three in a rank, and still the mid sheep bore
‚Ä≠  A man about his belly, the two more
‚Ä≠  March‚Äôd on his each side for defence.  I then,
‚Ä≠  Choosing myself the fairest of the den,
‚Ä≠  His fleecy belly under-crept, embrac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His back, and in his rich wool wrapt me fast
‚Ä≠  With both my hands, arm‚Äôd with as fast a mind.
‚Ä≠  And thus each man hung, till the morning shin‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  Which come, he knew the hour, and let abroad
‚Ä≠  His male-flocks first, the females unmilk‚Äôd stood
‚Ä≠  Bleating and braying, their full bags so sore
‚Ä≠  With being unemptied, but their shepherd more
‚Ä≠  With being unsighted; which was cause his mind
‚Ä≠  Went not a milking.  He, to wreak inclin‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  The backs felt, as they pass‚Äôd, of those male dams,
‚Ä≠  Gross fool!  believing, we would ride his rams!
‚Ä≠  Nor ever knew that any of them bore
‚Ä≠  Upon his belly any man before.
‚Ä≠  The last ram came to pass him, with his wool
‚Ä≠  And me together loaded to the full,
‚Ä≠  For there did I hang; and that ram he stay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And me withal had in his hands, my head
‚Ä≠  Troubled the while, not causelessly, nor least.
‚Ä≠  This ram he grop‚Äôd, and talk‚Äôd to:  ‚ÄòLazy beast!
‚Ä≠  Why last art thou now?  Thou hast never us‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To lag thus hindmost, but still first hast bruis‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The tender blossom of a flow‚Äôr, and held
‚Ä≠  State in thy steps, both to the flood and field,
‚Ä≠  First still at fold at even, now last remain?
‚Ä≠  Dost thou not wish I had mine eye again,
‚Ä≠  Which that abhorr‚Äôd man No-Man did put out,
‚Ä≠  Assisted by his execrable rout,
‚Ä≠  When he had wrought me down with wine?  But he
‚Ä≠  Must not escape my wreak so cunningly.
‚Ä≠  I would to heav‚Äôn thou knew‚Äôst, and could but speak,
‚Ä≠  To tell me where he lurks now!  I would break
‚Ä≠  His brain about my cave, strew‚Äôd here and there,
‚Ä≠  To ease my heart of those foul ills, that were
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô inflictions of a man I priz‚Äôd at nought.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     Thus let he him abroad; when I, once brought
‚Ä≠  A little from his hold, myself first los‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And next my friends.  Then drave we, and dispos‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  His straight-legg‚Äôd fat fleece-bearers over land,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn till they all were in my ship‚Äôs command;
‚Ä≠  And to our lov‚Äôd friends show‚Äôd our pray‚Äôd-for sight,
‚Ä≠  Escap‚Äôd from death.  But, for our loss, outright
‚Ä≠  They brake in tears; which with a look I stay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And bade them take our boot in.  They obey‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And up we all went, sat, and us‚Äôd our oars.
‚Ä≠  But having left as far the savage shores
‚Ä≠  As one might hear a voice, we then might see
‚Ä≠  The Cyclop at the haven; when instantly
‚Ä≠  I stay‚Äôd our oars, and this insultance us‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠  ·øæCyclop!  thou shouldst not have so much abus‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Thy monstrous forces, to oppose their least
‚Ä≠  Against a man immartial, and a guest,
‚Ä≠  And eat his fellows.  Thou mightst know there were
‚Ä≠  Some ills behind, rude swain, for thee to bear,
‚Ä≠  That fear‚Äôd not to devour thy guests, and break
‚Ä≠  All laws of humans.  Jove sends therefore wreak,
‚Ä≠  And all the Gods, by me.‚Äô  This blew the more
‚Ä≠  His burning fury; when the top he tore
‚Ä≠  From off a huge rock, and so right a throw
‚Ä≠  Made at our ship, that just before the prow
‚Ä≠  It overflew and fell, miss‚Äôd mast and all
‚Ä≠  Exceeding little; but about the fall
‚Ä≠  So fierce a wave it rais‚Äôd, that back it bore
‚Ä≠  Our ship so far, it almost touch‚Äôd the shore.
‚Ä≠  A bead-hook then, a far-extended one,
‚Ä≠  I snatch‚Äôd up, thrust hard, and so set us gone
‚Ä≠  Some little way; and straight commanded all
‚Ä≠  To help me with their oars, on pain to fall
‚Ä≠  Again on our confusion.  But a sign
‚Ä≠  I with my head made, and their oars were mine
‚Ä≠  In all performance.  When we off were set,
‚Ä≠  (Then first, twice further) my heart was so great,
‚Ä≠  It would again provoke him, but my men
‚Ä≠  On all sides rush‚Äôd about me, to contain,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄòUnhappy! why will you provoke
‚Ä≠  A man so rude, that with so dead a stroke,
‚Ä≠  Giv‚Äôn with his rock-dart, made the sea thrust back
‚Ä≠  Our ship so far, and near hand forc‚Äôd our wrack?
‚Ä≠  Should he again but hear your voice resound,
‚Ä≠  And any word reach, thereby would be found
‚Ä≠  His dart‚Äôs direction, which would, in his fall,
‚Ä≠  Crush piece-meal us, quite split our ship and all;
‚Ä≠  So much dart wields the monster.‚Äô  Thus urg‚Äôd they
‚Ä≠  Impossible things, in fear; but I gave way
‚Ä≠  To that wrath which so long I held deprest,
‚Ä≠  By great necessity conquer‚Äôd, in my breast:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòCyclop!  if any ask thee, who impos‚Äôd  [9]
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô unsightly blemish that thine eye enclos‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Say that Ulysses, old Laertes‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  Whose seat is Ithaca, and who hath won
‚Ä≠  Surname of City-razer, bor‚Äôd it out.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     At this, he bray‚Äôd so loud, that round about
‚Ä≠  He drave affrighted echoes through the air,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄòO beast!  I was premonish‚Äôd fair,
‚Ä≠  By aged prophecy, in one that was
‚Ä≠  A great and good man, this should come to pass;
‚Ä≠  And how ‚Äôtis prov‚Äôd now!  Augur Telemus,
‚Ä≠  Surnam‚Äôd Eurymides (that spent with us
‚Ä≠  His age in augury, and did exceed
‚Ä≠  In all presage of truth) said all this deed
‚Ä≠  Should this event take, author‚Äôd by the hand
‚Ä≠  Of one Ulysses, who I thought was mann‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With great and goodly personage, and bore
‚Ä≠  A virtue answerable; and this shore
‚Ä≠  Should shake with weight of such a conqueror;
‚Ä≠  When now a weakling came, a dwarfy thing,
‚Ä≠  A thing of nothing; who yet wit did bring,
‚Ä≠  That brought supply to all, and with his wine
‚Ä≠  Put out the flame where all my light did shine.
‚Ä≠  Come, land again, Ulysses!  that my hand
‚Ä≠  May guest-rites give thee, and the great command,
‚Ä≠  That Neptune hath at sea, I may convert
‚Ä≠  To the deduction where abides thy heart,
‚Ä≠  With my solicitings, whose son I am,
‚Ä≠  And whose fame boasts to bear my father‚Äôs name.
‚Ä≠  Nor think my hurt offends me, for my sire
‚Ä≠  Can soon repose in it the visual fire,
‚Ä≠  At his free pleasure; which no pow‚Äôr beside
‚Ä≠  Can boast, of men, or of the Deified.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     I answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄòWould to God!  I could compell
‚Ä≠  Both life and soul from thee, and send to hell
‚Ä≠  Those spoils of nature!  Hardly Neptune then
‚Ä≠  Could cure thy hurt, and give thee all again.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     Then flew fierce vows to Neptune, both his hands
‚Ä≠  To star-born heav‚Äôn cast: ‚ÄòO thou that all lands
‚Ä≠  Gird‚Äôst in thy ambient circle, and in air
‚Ä≠  Shak‚Äôst the curl‚Äôd tresses of thy sapphire hair,
‚Ä≠  If I be thine, or thou mayst justly vaunt
‚Ä≠  Thou art my father, hear me now, and grant
‚Ä≠  That this Ulysses, old Laertes‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  That dwells in Ithaca, and name hath won
‚Ä≠  Of City-ruiner, may never reach
‚Ä≠  His natural region.  Or if to fetch
‚Ä≠  That, and the sight of his fair roofs and friends,
‚Ä≠  Be fatal to him, let him that amends
‚Ä≠  For all his miseries, long time and ill,
‚Ä≠  Smart for, and fail of; nor that fate fulfill,
‚Ä≠  Till all his soldiers quite are cast away
‚Ä≠  In others‚Äô ships.  And when, at last, the day
‚Ä≠  Of his sole-landing shall his dwelling show,
‚Ä≠  Let Detriment prepare him wrongs enow.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     Thus pray‚Äôd he Neptune; who, his sire, appear‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And all his pray‚Äôr to ev‚Äôry syllable heard.
‚Ä≠  But then a rock, in size more amplified
‚Ä≠  Than first, he ravish‚Äôd to him, and implied
‚Ä≠  A dismal strength in it, when, wheel‚Äôd about,
‚Ä≠  He sent it after us; nor flew it out
‚Ä≠  From any blind aim, for a little pass
‚Ä≠  Beyond our fore-deck from the fall there was,
‚Ä≠  With which the sea our ship gave back upon,
‚Ä≠  And shrunk up into billows from the stone,
‚Ä≠  Our ship again repelling near as near
‚Ä≠  The shore as first.  But then our rowers were,
‚Ä≠  Being warn‚Äôd, more arm‚Äôd, and stronglier stemm‚Äôd the flood
‚Ä≠  That bore back on us, till our ship made good
‚Ä≠  The other island, where our whole fleet lay,
‚Ä≠  In which our friends lay mourning for our stay,
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôry minute look‚Äôd when we should land.
‚Ä≠  Where, now arriv‚Äôd, we drew up to the sand,
‚Ä≠  The Cyclops‚Äô sheep dividing, that none there
‚Ä≠  Of all our privates might be wrung, and bear
‚Ä≠  Too much on pow‚Äôr.  The ram yet was alone
‚Ä≠  By all my friends made all my portion
‚Ä≠  Above all others; and I made him then
‚Ä≠  A sacrifice for me and all my men  [10]
‚Ä≠  To cloud-compelling Jove that all commands,
‚Ä≠  To whom I burn‚Äôd the thighs; but my sad hands
‚Ä≠  Receiv‚Äôd no grace from him, who studied how
‚Ä≠  To offer men and fleet to overthrow.

‚Ä≠     All day, till sun-set, yet, we sat and eat,
‚Ä≠  And lib‚Äôral store took in of wine and meat.
‚Ä≠  The sun then down, and place resign‚Äôd to shade,
‚Ä≠  We slept.  Morn came, my men I rais‚Äôd, and made
‚Ä≠  All go aboard, weigh anchor, and away.
‚Ä≠  They boarded, sat, and beat the aged sea;
‚Ä≠  And forth we made sail, sad for loss before,
‚Ä≠  Any yet had comfort since we lost no more.‚Äù

‚Ä≠  THE TENTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Ulysses now relates to us
‚Ä≠  The grace he had with √Üolus,
‚Ä≠  Great Guardian of the hollow Winds;
‚Ä≠  Which in a leather bag he binds,
‚Ä≠  And gives Ulysses; all but one,
‚Ä≠  Which Zephyr was, who fill‚Äôd alone
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô sails.  The bag once seen,
‚Ä≠  While he slept, by Ulysses‚Äô men,
‚Ä≠  They thinking it did gold enclose,
‚Ä≠  To find it, all the winds did loose,
‚Ä≠  Who back flew to their Guard again.
‚Ä≠  Forth sail‚Äôd he; and did next attain
‚Ä≠  To where the L√¶strygonians dwell.
‚Ä≠  Where he eleven ships lost, and fell
‚Ä≠  On the √Ü√¶an coast, whose shore
‚Ä≠  He sends Eurylochus t‚Äô explore,
‚Ä≠  Dividing with him half his men.
‚Ä≠  Who go, and turn no more again,
‚Ä≠  All, save Eurylochus, to swine
‚Ä≠  By Circe turn‚Äôd.  Their stays incline
‚Ä≠  Ulysses to their search; who got
‚Ä≠  Of Mercury an antidote,
‚Ä≠  Which moly was, ‚Äôgainst Circe‚Äôs charms,
‚Ä≠  And so avoids his soldiers‚Äô harms.
‚Ä≠  A year with Circe all remain,
‚Ä≠  And then their native forms regain.
‚Ä≠  On utter shores a time they dwell,
‚Ä≠  While Ithacus descends to hell.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _Œö·Ω±œÄœÄŒ±._
‚Ä≠     Great √Üolus,
‚Ä≠        And Circe, friends
‚Ä≠     Finds Ithacus;
‚Ä≠        And hell descends.

‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúTo the √Üolian island we attain‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  That swum about still on the sea, where reign‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The God-lov‚Äôd √Üolus Hippotades.
‚Ä≠  A wall of steel it had; and in the seas
‚Ä≠  A wave-beat-smooth rock mov‚Äôd about the wall.
‚Ä≠  Twelve children in his house imperial
‚Ä≠  Were born to him; of which six daughters were,
‚Ä≠  And six were sons, that youth‚Äôs sweet flow‚Äôr did bear.
‚Ä≠  His daughters to his sons he gave as wives;
‚Ä≠  Who spent in feastful comforts all their lives,
‚Ä≠  Close seated by their sire and his grave spouse.
‚Ä≠  Past number were the dishes that the house
‚Ä≠  Made ever savour; and still full the hall
‚Ä≠  As long as day shin‚Äôd; in the night-time, all
‚Ä≠  Slept with their chaste wives, each his fair carv‚Äôd bed
‚Ä≠  Most richly furnish‚Äôd; and this life they led.
‚Ä≠     We reach‚Äôd the city and fair roofs of these,
‚Ä≠  Where, a whole month‚Äôs time, all things that might please
‚Ä≠  The king vouchsaf‚Äôd us; of great Troy inquir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  The Grecian fleet, and how the Greeks retir‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  To all which I gave answer as behov‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     The fit time come when I dismission mov‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  He nothing would deny me, but addrest
‚Ä≠  My pass with such a bounty, as might best
‚Ä≠  Teach me contentment; for he did enfold
‚Ä≠  Within an ox-hide, flay‚Äôd at nine years old,
‚Ä≠  All th‚Äô airy blasts that were of stormy kinds.
‚Ä≠  Saturnius made him Steward of his Winds,
‚Ä≠  And gave him pow‚Äôr to raise and to assuage.
‚Ä≠  And these he gave me, curb‚Äôd thus of their rage,
‚Ä≠  Which in a glitt‚Äôring silver band I bound,
‚Ä≠  And hung-up in my ship, enclos‚Äôd so round
‚Ä≠  That no egression any breath could find;
‚Ä≠  Only he left abroad the Western Wind,
‚Ä≠  To speed our ships, and us with blasts secure.
‚Ä≠  But our securities made all unsure;
‚Ä≠  Nor could he consummate our course alone,
‚Ä≠  When all the rest had got egressi√≥n;
‚Ä≠  Which thus succeeded:  Nine whole days and nights
‚Ä≠  We sail‚Äôd in safety; and the tenth, the lights
‚Ä≠  Borne on our country-earth we might descry,
‚Ä≠  So near we drew; and yet ev‚Äôn then fell I,
‚Ä≠  Being overwatch‚Äôd, into a fatal sleep,
‚Ä≠  For I would suffer no man else to keep
‚Ä≠  The foot that rul‚Äôd my vessel‚Äôs course, to lead  [1]
‚Ä≠  The faster home.  My friends then Envy fed
‚Ä≠  About the bag I hung-up, and suppos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  That gold and silver I had there enclos‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  As gift from √Üolus, and said:  ‚ÄòO heav‚Äôn!
‚Ä≠  What grace and grave price is by all men giv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  To our commander!  Whatsoever coast
‚Ä≠  Or town he comes to, how much he engrost
‚Ä≠  Of fair and precious prey, and brought from Troy!
‚Ä≠  We the same voyage went, and yet enjoy
‚Ä≠  In our return these empty hands for all.
‚Ä≠  This bag, now, √Üolus was so liberal
‚Ä≠  To make a guest-gift to him; let us try
‚Ä≠  Of what consists the fair-bound treasury,
‚Ä≠  And how much gold and silver it contains.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  _Ill counsel present approbation gains._
‚Ä≠  They op‚Äôd the bag, and out the vapours brake,
‚Ä≠  When instant tempest did our vessel take,
‚Ä≠  That bore us back to sea, to mourn anew
‚Ä≠  Our absent country.  Up amaz‚Äôd I flew,
‚Ä≠  And desp‚Äôrate things discours‚Äôd; if I should cast
‚Ä≠  Myself to ruin in the seas, or taste
‚Ä≠  Amongst the living more moan, and sustain?
‚Ä≠  Silent, I did so, and lay hid again
‚Ä≠  Beneath the hatches, while an ill wind took
‚Ä≠  My ships back to √Üolia, my men strook
‚Ä≠  With woe enough.  We pump‚Äôd and landed then,
‚Ä≠  Took food, for all this; and of all my men
‚Ä≠  I took a herald to me, and away
‚Ä≠  Went to the court of √Üolus, where they
‚Ä≠  Were feasting still; he, wife, and children, set
‚Ä≠  Together close.  We would not at their meat
‚Ä≠  Thrust in; but humbly on the threshold sat.
‚Ä≠  He then, amaz‚Äôd, my presence wonder‚Äôd at,
‚Ä≠  And call‚Äôd to me:  ‚ÄòUlysses!  How thus back
‚Ä≠  Art thou arriv‚Äôd here?  What foul spirit brake
‚Ä≠  Into thy bosom, to retire thee thus?
‚Ä≠  We thought we had deduction curious
‚Ä≠  Giv‚Äôn thee before, to reach thy shore and home;
‚Ä≠  Did it not like thee?‚Äô  I, ev‚Äôn overcome
‚Ä≠  With worthy sorrow, answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄòMy ill men
‚Ä≠  Have done me mischief, and to them hath been
‚Ä≠  My sleep th‚Äô unhappy motive; but do you,
‚Ä≠  Dearest of friends, deign succour to my vow.
‚Ä≠  Your pow‚Äôrs command it.‚Äô  Thus endeavour‚Äôd I
‚Ä≠  With soft speech to repair my misery.
‚Ä≠  The rest with ruth sat dumb.  But thus spake he:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòAvaunt, and quickly quit my land of thee,
‚Ä≠  Thou worst of all that breathe.  It fits not me
‚Ä≠  To convoy, and take-in, whom Heav‚Äôns expose.
‚Ä≠  Away, and with thee go the worst of woes,
‚Ä≠  That seek‚Äôst my friendship, and the Gods thy foes.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     Thus he dismiss‚Äôd me sighing.  Forth we sail‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  At heart afflicted.  And now wholly fail‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The minds my men sustain‚Äôd, so spent they were
‚Ä≠  With toiling at their oars, and worse did bear
‚Ä≠  Their growing labours; and they caus‚Äôd their grought
‚Ä≠  By self-will‚Äôd follies;  nor now ever thought
‚Ä≠  To see their country more.  Six nights and days
‚Ä≠  We sail‚Äôd; the seventh we saw fair Lamos raise
‚Ä≠  Her lofty tow‚Äôrs, the L√¶strygonian state
‚Ä≠  That bears her ports so far disterminate;
‚Ä≠  Where shepherd shepherd calls out, he at home  [2]
‚Ä≠  Is call‚Äôd out by the other that doth come
‚Ä≠  From charge abroad, and then goes he to sleep,
‚Ä≠  The other issuing; he whose turn doth keep
‚Ä≠  The night observance hath his double hire,
‚Ä≠  Since day and night in equal length expire
‚Ä≠  About that region, and the night‚Äôs watch weigh‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  At twice the day‚Äôs ward, since the charge that‚Äôs laid
‚Ä≠  Upon the night‚Äôs-man (besides breach of sleep)
‚Ä≠  Exceeds the days-man‚Äôs; for one oxen keep,
‚Ä≠  The other sheep.  But when the haven we found,
‚Ä≠  (Exceeding famous, and environ‚Äôd round
‚Ä≠  With one continuate rock, which so much bent
‚Ä≠  That both ends almost met, so prominent
‚Ä≠  They were, and made the haven‚Äôs mouth passing strait)
‚Ä≠  Our whole fleet in we got; in whose receit
‚Ä≠  Our ships lay anchor‚Äôd close.  Nor needed we
‚Ä≠  Fear harm on any stays, Tranquillity  [3]
‚Ä≠  So purely sat there, that waves great nor small
‚Ä≠  Did ever rise to any height at all.
‚Ä≠  And yet would I no entry make, but stay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Alone without the haven, and thence survey‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  From out a lofty watch-tow‚Äôr raised there,
‚Ä≠  The country round about; nor anywhere
‚Ä≠  The work of man or beast appear‚Äôd to me,
‚Ä≠  Only a smoke from earth break I might see.
‚Ä≠  I then made choice of two, and added more,
‚Ä≠  A herald for associate, to explore
‚Ä≠  What sort of men liv‚Äôd there.  They went, and saw
‚Ä≠  A beaten way, through which carts us‚Äôd to draw
‚Ä≠  Wood from the high hills to the town, and met
‚Ä≠  A maid without the port, about to get
‚Ä≠  Some near spring-water.  She the daughter was
‚Ä≠  Of mighty L√¶strygonian Antiphas,
‚Ä≠  And to the clear spring call‚Äôd Artacia went,
‚Ä≠  To which the whole town for their water sent.
‚Ä≠  To her they came, and ask‚Äôd who govern‚Äôd there,
‚Ä≠  And what the people whom he order‚Äôd were?
‚Ä≠  She answer‚Äôd not, but led them through the port,
‚Ä≠  As making haste to show her father‚Äôs court.
‚Ä≠  Where enter‚Äôd, they beheld, to their affright,
‚Ä≠  A woman like a mountain-top in height,
‚Ä≠  Who rush‚Äôd abroad, and from the council-place
‚Ä≠  Call‚Äôd home her horrid husband Antiphas,  [4]
‚Ä≠  Who, deadly-minded, straight he snatch‚Äôd up one,
‚Ä≠  And fell to supper.  Both the rest were gone;
‚Ä≠  And to the fleet came.  Antiphas a cry
‚Ä≠  Drave through the city; which heard, instantly
‚Ä≠  This way and that innumerable sorts,
‚Ä≠  Not men, but giants, issued through the ports,
‚Ä≠  And mighty flints from rocks tore, which they threw
‚Ä≠  Amongst our ships; through which an ill noise flew
‚Ä≠  Of shiver‚Äôd ships, and life-expiring men,
‚Ä≠  That were, like fishes, by the monsters slain,
‚Ä≠  And borne to sad feast.  While they slaughter‚Äôd these,
‚Ä≠  That were engag‚Äôd in all th‚Äô advantages
‚Ä≠  The close-mouth‚Äôd and most dead-calm haven could give,
‚Ä≠  I, that without lay, made some means to live,
‚Ä≠  My sword drew, cut my gables, and to oars
‚Ä≠  Set all my men; and, from the plagues those shores
‚Ä≠  Let fly amongst us, we made haste to fly,
‚Ä≠  My men close working as men loth to die.
‚Ä≠  My ship flew freely off; but theirs that lay
‚Ä≠  On heaps in harbours could enforce no way
‚Ä≠  Through these stern fates that had engag‚Äôd them there.
‚Ä≠  Forth our sad remnant sail‚Äôd, yet still retain‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The joys of men, that our poor few remain‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     Then to the isle √Ü√¶a we attain‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Where fair-hair‚Äôd, dreadful, eloquent Circe reign‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  √Ü√¶ta‚Äôs sister both by dame and sire,
‚Ä≠  Both daughters to Heav‚Äôn‚Äôs man-enlight‚Äôning Fire,
‚Ä≠  And Perse, whom Oceanus begat,
‚Ä≠  The ship-fit port here soon we landed at,
‚Ä≠  Some God directing us.  Two days, two nights,
‚Ä≠  We lay here pining in the fatal spights
‚Ä≠  Of toil and sorrow; but the next third day
‚Ä≠  When fair Aurora had inform‚Äôd, quick way
‚Ä≠  I made out of my ship, my sword and lance
‚Ä≠  Took for my surer guide, and made advance
‚Ä≠  Up to a prospect; I assay to see
‚Ä≠  The works of men, or hear mortality
‚Ä≠  Exspire a voice.  When I had climb‚Äôd a height,
‚Ä≠  Rough and right hardly accessible, I might
‚Ä≠  Behold from Circe‚Äôs house, that in a grove
‚Ä≠  Set thick with trees stood, a bright vapour move,
‚Ä≠  I then grew curious in my thought to try  [5]
‚Ä≠  Some fit inquiry, when so spritely fly
‚Ä≠  I saw the yellow smoke; but my discourse  [6]
‚Ä≠  A first retiring to my ship gave force,
‚Ä≠  To give my men their dinner, and to send
‚Ä≠  (Before th‚Äô adventure of myself) some friend.
‚Ä≠  Being near my ship, of one so desolate
‚Ä≠  Some God had pity, and would recreate
‚Ä≠  My woes a little, putting up to me
‚Ä≠  A great and high-palm‚Äôd hart, that (fatally,
‚Ä≠  Just in my way itself to taste a flood)
‚Ä≠  Was then descending; the sun heat had sure
‚Ä≠  Importun‚Äôd him, besides the temperature
‚Ä≠  His natural heat gave.  Howsoever, I
‚Ä≠  Made up to him, and let my jav‚Äôlin fly,
‚Ä≠  That struck him through the mid-part of his chine,
‚Ä≠  And made him, braying, to the dust confine
‚Ä≠  His flying forces.  Forth his spirit flew;
‚Ä≠  When I stept in, and from the death‚Äôs wound drew
‚Ä≠  My shrewdly-bitten lance; there let him lie
‚Ä≠  Till I, of cut-up osiers, did imply
‚Ä≠  A withe a fathom long, with which his feet
‚Ä≠  I made together in a sure league meet,
‚Ä≠  Stoop‚Äôd under him, and to my neck I heav‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The mighty burden, of which I receiv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A good part on my lance, for else I could
‚Ä≠  By no means with one hand alone uphold
‚Ä≠  (Join‚Äôd with one shoulder) such a deathful load.
‚Ä≠  And so, to both my shoulders, both hands stood
‚Ä≠  Needful assistants; for it was a deer
‚Ä≠  Goodly-well-grown.  When (coming something near
‚Ä≠  Where rode my ships) I cast it down, and rear‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  My friends with kind words; whom by name I cheer‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  In note particular, and said:  ‚ÄòSee, friends,
‚Ä≠  We will not yet to Pluto‚Äôs house; our ends
‚Ä≠  Shall not be hasten‚Äôd, though we be declin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In cause of comfort, till the day design‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By Fate‚Äôs fix‚Äôd finger.  Come, as long as food
‚Ä≠  Or wine lasts in our ship, let‚Äôs spirit our blood,
‚Ä≠  And quit our care and hunger both in one.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This said, they frolick‚Äôd, came, and look‚Äôd upon
‚Ä≠  With admiration the huge-bodied beast;
‚Ä≠  And when their first-serv‚Äôd eyes had done their feast,
‚Ä≠  They wash‚Äôd, and made a to-be-striv‚Äôd-for meal  [7]
‚Ä≠  In point of honour.  On which all did dwell
‚Ä≠  The whole day long.  And, to our venison‚Äôs store,
‚Ä≠  We added wine till we could wish no more.
‚Ä≠     Sun set, and darkness up, we slept, till light
‚Ä≠  Put darkness down; and then did I excite
‚Ä≠  My friends to counsel, utt‚Äôring this:  ‚ÄòNow, friends,  [8]
‚Ä≠  Afford unpassionate ear; though ill Fate lends
‚Ä≠  So good cause to your passion, no man knows
‚Ä≠  The reason whence and how the darkness grows;
‚Ä≠  The reason how the morn is thus begun;
‚Ä≠  The reason how the man-enlight‚Äôning sun
‚Ä≠  Dives under earth;  the reason how again
‚Ä≠  He rears his golden head.  Those counsels, then,
‚Ä≠  That pass our comprehension, we must leave
‚Ä≠  To him that knows their causes;  and receive
‚Ä≠  Direction from him in our acts, as far
‚Ä≠  As he shall please to make them regular,
‚Ä≠  And stoop them to our reason.  In our state
‚Ä≠  What then behoves us?  Can we estimate,
‚Ä≠  With all our counsels, where we are?  Or know
‚Ä≠  (Without instruction, past our own skills) how,
‚Ä≠  Put off from hence, to steer our course the more?
‚Ä≠  I think we cannot.  We must then explore
‚Ä≠  These parts for information; in which way
‚Ä≠  We thus far are:  Last morn I might display
‚Ä≠  (From off a high-rais‚Äôd cliff) an island lie
‚Ä≠  Girt with th‚Äô unmeasur‚Äôd sea, and is so nigh
‚Ä≠  That in the midst I saw the smoke arise
‚Ä≠  Through tufts of trees.  This rests then to advise,
‚Ä≠  Who shall explore this?‚Äô This struck dead their hearts,
‚Ä≠  Rememb‚Äôring the most execrable parts
‚Ä≠  That L√¶strygonian Antiphas had play‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And that foul Cyclop that their fellows bray‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Betwixt his jaws; which mov‚Äôd them so, they cried.
‚Ä≠  But idle tears had never wants supplied.
‚Ä≠  I in two parts divided all, and gave
‚Ä≠  To either part his captain.  I must have
‚Ä≠  The charge of one; and one of God-like look,
‚Ä≠  Eurylochus, the other.  Lots we shook,
‚Ä≠  Put in a casque together, which of us
‚Ä≠  Should lead th‚Äô attempt; and ‚Äôtwas Eurylochus.
‚Ä≠  He freely went, with two-and-twenty more;
‚Ä≠  All which took leave with tears; and our eyes wore
‚Ä≠  The same wet badge of weak humanity.
‚Ä≠  These in a dale did Circe‚Äôs house descry,
‚Ä≠  Of bright stone built, in a conspicuous way.
‚Ä≠  Before her gates hill-wolves, and lions, lay;
‚Ä≠  Which with her virtuous drugs so tame she made,
‚Ä≠  That wolf nor lion would one man invade
‚Ä≠  With any violence, but all arose,
‚Ä≠  Their huge long tails wagg‚Äôd, and in fawns would close,
‚Ä≠  As loving dogs, when masters bring them home
‚Ä≠  Relics of feast, in all observance come,
‚Ä≠  And soothe their entries with their fawns and bounds,
‚Ä≠  All guests still bringing some scraps for their hounds;
‚Ä≠  So, on these men, the wolves and lions ramp‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Their horrid paws set up.  Their spirits were damp‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To see such monstrous kindness, stay‚Äôd at gate,
‚Ä≠  And heard within the Goddess elevate
‚Ä≠  A voice divine, as at her web she wrought,
‚Ä≠  Subtle, and glorious, and past earthly thought,
‚Ä≠  As all the housewif‚Äôries of Deities are.
‚Ä≠  To hear a voice so ravishingly rare,
‚Ä≠  Polit√©s (one exceeding dear to me,
‚Ä≠  A prince of men, and of no mean degree
‚Ä≠  In knowing virtue, in all acts whose mind  [9]
‚Ä≠  Discreet cares all ways us‚Äôd to turn, and wind)
‚Ä≠  Was yet surpris‚Äôd with it, and said:  ‚ÄòO friends,
‚Ä≠  Some one abides within here, that commends
‚Ä≠  The place to us, and breathes a voice divine,
‚Ä≠  As she some web wrought, or her spindle‚Äôs twine
‚Ä≠  She cherish‚Äôd with her song; the pavement rings
‚Ä≠  With imitation of the tunes she sings.
‚Ä≠  Some woman, or some Goddess, ‚Äôtis.  Assay
‚Ä≠  To see with knocking.‚Äô  Thus said he, and they
‚Ä≠  Both knock‚Äôd, and call‚Äôd; and straight her shining gates
‚Ä≠  She open‚Äôd, issuing, bade them in to cates.
‚Ä≠  Led, and unwise, they follow‚Äôd; all but one,
‚Ä≠  Which was Eurylochus, who stood alone
‚Ä≠  Without the gates, suspicious of a sleight.
‚Ä≠  They enter‚Äôd, she made sit; and her deceit
‚Ä≠  She cloak‚Äôd with thrones, and goodly chairs of state;
‚Ä≠  Set herby honey, and the delicate
‚Ä≠  Wine brought from Smynra, to them; meal and cheese;
‚Ä≠  But harmful venoms she commix‚Äôd with these,
‚Ä≠  That made their country vanish from their thought.
‚Ä≠  Which eat, she touch‚Äôd them with a rod that wrought
‚Ä≠  Their transformation far past human wonts;
‚Ä≠  Swine‚Äôs snouts, swine‚Äôs bodies, took they, bristles, grunts,
‚Ä≠  But still retain‚Äôd the souls they had before,
‚Ä≠  Which made them mourn their bodies‚Äô change the more.
‚Ä≠  She shut them straight in styes, and gave them meat,
‚Ä≠  Oak-mast, and beech, and cornel-fruit, they eat,
‚Ä≠  Grov‚Äôlling like swine on earth, in foulest sort.
‚Ä≠  Eurylochus straight hasted the report
‚Ä≠  Of this his fellows‚Äô most remorseful fate,
‚Ä≠  Came to the ships, but so excruciate
‚Ä≠  Was with his woe, he could not speak a word,
‚Ä≠  His eyes stood full of tears, which show‚Äôd how stor‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His mind with moan remain‚Äôd.  We all admir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Ask‚Äôd what had chanc‚Äôd him, earnestly desir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  He would resolve us.  At the last, our eyes
‚Ä≠  Enflam‚Äôd in him his fellows‚Äô memories,  [10]
‚Ä≠  And out his grief burst thus:  ‚ÄòYou will‚Äôd; we went
‚Ä≠  Through those thick woods you saw; when a descent
‚Ä≠  Show‚Äôd us a fair house, in a lightsome ground,
‚Ä≠  Where, at some work, we heard a heav‚Äônly sound
‚Ä≠  Breath‚Äôd from a Goddess‚Äô, or a woman‚Äôs, breast.
‚Ä≠  They knock‚Äôd, she op‚Äôd her bright gates; each her guest
‚Ä≠  Her fair invitement made; nor would they stay,
‚Ä≠  Fools that they were, when she once led the way.
‚Ä≠  I enter‚Äôd not, suspecting some deceit.
‚Ä≠  When all together vanish‚Äôd, nor the sight
‚Ä≠  Of anyone (though long I look‚Äôd) mine eye
‚Ä≠  Could any way discover.‚Äô  Instantly,
‚Ä≠  My sword and bow reach‚Äôd, I bad show the place,
‚Ä≠  When down he fell, did both my knees embrace,
‚Ä≠  And pray‚Äôd with tears thus:  ‚ÄòO thou kept of God,
‚Ä≠  Do not thyself lose, nor to that abode
‚Ä≠  Lead others rashly; both thyself, and all
‚Ä≠  Thou ventur‚Äôst thither, I know well, must fall
‚Ä≠  In one sure ruin.  With these few then fly;
‚Ä≠  We yet may shun the others‚Äô destiny.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     I answer‚Äôd him:  ‚ÄòEurylochus!  Stay thou,
‚Ä≠  And keep the ship then, eat and drink; I now
‚Ä≠  Will undertake th‚Äô adventure; there is cause
‚Ä≠  In great Necessity‚Äôs unalter‚Äôd laws.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  This said, I left both ship and seas, and on
‚Ä≠  Along the sacred valleys all alone
‚Ä≠  Went in discov‚Äôry, till at last I came
‚Ä≠  Where of the main-med‚Äôcine-making Dame
‚Ä≠  I saw the great house; where encounter‚Äôd me
‚Ä≠  The golden-rod-sustaining Mercury,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn ent‚Äôring Circe‚Äôs doors.  He met me in
‚Ä≠  A young man‚Äôs likeness, of the first-flow‚Äôr‚Äôd chin,
‚Ä≠  Whose form hath all the grace of one so young.
‚Ä≠  He first call‚Äôd to me, then my hand he wrung,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄòThou no-place-finding-for-repose,
‚Ä≠  Whither, alone, by these hill-confines, goes
‚Ä≠  Thy erring foot?  Th‚Äô art ent‚Äôring Circe‚Äôs house,
‚Ä≠  Where, by her med‚Äôcines, black, and sorcerous,
‚Ä≠  Thy soldiers all are shut in well-arm‚Äôd styes,
‚Ä≠  And turn‚Äôd to swine.  Art thou arriv‚Äôd with prize
‚Ä≠  Fit for their ransoms?  Thou com‚Äôst out no more,
‚Ä≠  If once thou ent‚Äôrest, like thy men before
‚Ä≠  Made to remain here.  But I‚Äôll guard thee free,
‚Ä≠  And save thee in her spite.  Receive of me
‚Ä≠  This fair and good receipt; with which once arm‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Enter her roofs, for th‚Äô art to all proof charm‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Against the ill day.  I will tell thee all
‚Ä≠  Her baneful counsel:  With a festival
‚Ä≠  She‚Äôll first receive thee, but will spice thy bread
‚Ä≠  With flow‚Äôry poisons; yet unalter√©d
‚Ä≠  Shall thy firm form be, for this remedy
‚Ä≠  Stands most approv‚Äôd ‚Äôgainst all her sorcery,
‚Ä≠  Which thus particularly shun:  When she
‚Ä≠  Shall with her long rod strike thee, instantly
‚Ä≠  Draw from thy thigh thy sword, and fly on her
‚Ä≠  As to her slaughter.  She, surpris‚Äôd with fear
‚Ä≠  And love, at first, will bid thee to her bed.
‚Ä≠  Nor say the Goddess nay, that welcom√©d
‚Ä≠  Thou may‚Äôst with all respect be, and procure
‚Ä≠  Thy fellows‚Äô freedoms.  But before, make sure
‚Ä≠  Her favours to thee; and the great oath take
‚Ä≠  With which the bless√©d Gods assurance make
‚Ä≠  Of all they promise; that no prejudice
‚Ä≠  (By stripping thee of form, and faculties)
‚Ä≠  She may so much as once attempt on thee.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  This said, he gave his antidote to me,
‚Ä≠  Which from the earth he pluck‚Äôd, and told me all
‚Ä≠  The virtue of it, with what Deities call
‚Ä≠  The name it bears; and Moly  [11]  they impose
‚Ä≠  For name to it.  The root is hard to loose
‚Ä≠  From hold of earth by mortals; but God‚Äôs pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  Can all things do.  ‚ÄôTis black, but bears a flow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  As white as milk.  And thus flew Mercury
‚Ä≠  Up to immense Olympus, gliding by
‚Ä≠  The sylvan island.  I made back my way
‚Ä≠  To Circe‚Äôs house, my mind of my assay
‚Ä≠  Much thought revolving.  At her gates I stay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  And call‚Äôd; she heard, and her bright doors display‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Invited, led; I follow‚Äôd in, but trac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With some distraction.  In a throne she plac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  My welcome person; of a curious frame
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTwas, and so bright I sat as in a flame;
‚Ä≠  A foot-stool added.  In a golden bowl
‚Ä≠  She then suborn‚Äôd a potion, in her soul
‚Ä≠  Deform‚Äôd things thinking; for amidst the wine
‚Ä≠  She mix‚Äôd her man-transforming medicine;
‚Ä≠  Which when she saw I had devour‚Äôd, she then
‚Ä≠  No more observ‚Äôd me with her soothing vein,
‚Ä≠  But struck me with her rod, and to her stye
‚Ä≠  Bad, out, away, and with thy fellows lie.
‚Ä≠  I drew my sword, and charg‚Äôd her, as I meant
‚Ä≠  To take her life.  When out she cried, and bent
‚Ä≠  Beneath my sword her knees, embracing mine,
‚Ä≠  And, full of tears, said:  ‚ÄòWho?  Of what high line
‚Ä≠  Art thou the issue?  Whence?  What shores sustain
‚Ä≠  Thy native city?  I amaz‚Äôd remain
‚Ä≠  That, drinking these my venoms, th‚Äô art not turn‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Never drunk any this cup but be mourn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In other likeness, if it once had pass‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The ivory bounders of his tongue and taste.
‚Ä≠  All but thyself are brutishly declin‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Thy breast holds firm yet, and unchang‚Äôd thy mind.
‚Ä≠  Thou canst be therefore none else but the man
‚Ä≠  Of many virtues, Ithacensian,
‚Ä≠  Deep-soul‚Äôd, Ulysses, who; I oft was told,
‚Ä≠  By that sly God that bears the rod of gold,
‚Ä≠  Was to arrive here in retreat from Troy.
‚Ä≠  Sheathe then thy sword, and let my bed enjoy
‚Ä≠  So much a man, that when the bed we prove,
‚Ä≠  We may believe in one another‚Äôs love.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     I then:  ‚ÄòO Circe, why entreat‚Äôst thou me
‚Ä≠  To mix in any human league with thee,
‚Ä≠  When thou my friends hast beasts turn‚Äôd; and thy bed
‚Ä≠  Tender‚Äôst to me, that I might likewise lead
‚Ä≠  A beast‚Äôs life with thee, soften‚Äôd, naked stripp‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  That in my blood thy banes may more be steep‚Äôd?
‚Ä≠  I never will ascend thy bed, before,
‚Ä≠  I may affirm, that in heav‚Äôn‚Äôs sight you swore
‚Ä≠  The great oath of the Gods, that all attempt
‚Ä≠  To do me ill is from your thoughts exempt.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     I said, she swore, when, all the oath-rites said,
‚Ä≠  I then ascended her adorn√©d bed,
‚Ä≠  But thus prepar‚Äôd:  Four handmaids served her there,
‚Ä≠  That daughters to her silver fountains were,
‚Ä≠  To her bright-sea-observing sacred floods,
‚Ä≠  And to her uncut consecrated woods.
‚Ä≠  One deck‚Äôd the throne-tops with rich cloths of state,
‚Ä≠  And did with silks the foot-pace consecrate.
‚Ä≠  Another silver tables set before
‚Ä≠  The pompous throne, and golden dishes‚Äô store
‚Ä≠  Serv‚Äôd in with sev‚Äôral feast.  A third fill‚Äôd wine.
‚Ä≠  The fourth brought water, and made fuel shine
‚Ä≠  In ruddy fires beneath a womb of brass.
‚Ä≠  Which heat, I bath‚Äôd;  and od‚Äôrous water was
‚Ä≠  Disperpled lightly on my head and neck,
‚Ä≠  That might my late heart-hurting sorrows check
‚Ä≠  With the refreshing sweetness; and, for that,
‚Ä≠  Men sometimes may be something delicate.
‚Ä≠  Bath‚Äôd, and adorn‚Äôd, she led me to a throne
‚Ä≠  Of massy silver, and of fashi√≥n
‚Ä≠  Exceeding curious.  A fair foot-stool set,
‚Ä≠  Water appos‚Äôd, and ev‚Äôry sort of meat
‚Ä≠  Set on th‚Äô elaborately-polish‚Äôd board,
‚Ä≠  She wish‚Äôd my taste employ‚Äôd; but not a word
‚Ä≠  Would my ears taste of taste; my mind had food
‚Ä≠  That must digest; eye-meat would do me good.
‚Ä≠  Circe (observing that I put no hand
‚Ä≠  To any banquet, having countermand
‚Ä≠  From weightier cares the light cates could excuse)
‚Ä≠  Bowing her near me, these wing‚Äôd words did use;
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄòWhy sits Ulysses like one dumb, his mind
‚Ä≠  Less‚Äôning with languors?  Nor to food inclin‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Nor wine?  Whence comes it?  Out of any fear
‚Ä≠  Of more illusion?  You must needs forbear
‚Ä≠  That wrongful doubt, since you have heard me swear.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄòO Circe!‚Äô  I replied,  ‚Äòwhat man is he,
‚Ä≠  Aw‚Äôd with the rights of true humanity,
‚Ä≠  That dares taste food or wine, before he sees
‚Ä≠  His friends redeem‚Äôd from their deformities?
‚Ä≠  If you be gentle, and indeed incline
‚Ä≠  To let me taste the comfort of your wine,
‚Ä≠  Dissolve the charms that their forc‚Äôd forms enchain,
‚Ä≠  And show me here my honour‚Äôd friends like men.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This said, she left her throne, and took her rod,
‚Ä≠  Went to her stye, and let my men abroad,
‚Ä≠  Like swine of nine years old.  They opposite stood,
‚Ä≠  Observ‚Äôd their brutish form, and look‚Äôd for food;
‚Ä≠  When, with another med‚Äôcine, ev‚Äôry one
‚Ä≠  All over smear‚Äôd, their bristles all were gone,
‚Ä≠  Produc‚Äôd by malice of the other bane,
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôry one, afresh, look‚Äôd up a man,
‚Ä≠  Both younger than they were, of stature more,
‚Ä≠  And all their forms much goodlier than before.
‚Ä≠  All knew me, cling‚Äôd about me, and a cry
‚Ä≠  Of pleasing mourning flew about so high
‚Ä≠  The horrid roof resounded; and the queen
‚Ä≠  Herself was mov‚Äôd to see our kind so keen,
‚Ä≠  Who bad me now bring ship and men ashore,
‚Ä≠  Our arms, and goods in caves hid, and restore
‚Ä≠  Myself to her, with all my other men.
‚Ä≠  I granted, went, and op‚Äôd the weeping vein
‚Ä≠  In all my men; whose violent joy to see
‚Ä≠  My safe return was passing kindly free
‚Ä≠  Of friendly tears, and miserably wept.
‚Ä≠  You have not seen young heifers (highly kept,
‚Ä≠  Fill‚Äôd full of daisies at the field, and driv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  Home to their hovels, all so spritely giv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  That no room can contain them, but about
‚Ä≠  Bace by the dams, and let their spirits out
‚Ä≠  In ceaseless bleating) of more jocund plight
‚Ä≠  Than my kind friends, ev‚Äôn crying out with sight
‚Ä≠  Of my return so doubted; circled me
‚Ä≠  With all their welcomes, and as cheerfully
‚Ä≠  Dispos‚Äôd their rapt minds, as if there they saw
‚Ä≠  Their natural country, cliffy Ithaca,
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôn the roofs where they were bred and born,
‚Ä≠  And vow‚Äôd as much, with tears;  ‚ÄòO your return
‚Ä≠  As much delights us as in you had come
‚Ä≠  Our country to us, and our natural home.
‚Ä≠  But what unhappy fate hath reft our friends?‚Äô
‚Ä≠  I gave unlook‚Äôd-for answer, that amends
‚Ä≠  Made for their mourning, bad them first of all
‚Ä≠  Our ship ashore draw, then in caverns stall
‚Ä≠  Our foody cattle, hide our mutual prize,
‚Ä≠  ·øæAnd then,·æø  said I,  ·øæattend me, that your eyes,
‚Ä≠  In Circe‚Äôs sacred house, may see each friend
‚Ä≠  Eating and drinking banquets out of end.·æø
‚Ä≠     They soon obey‚Äôd; all but Eurylochus,
‚Ä≠  Who needs would stay them all, and counsell‚Äôd thus:
‚Ä≠     ·øæO wretches!  whither will ye?  Why are you
‚Ä≠  Fond of your mischiefs, and such gladness show
‚Ä≠  For Circe‚Äôs house, that will transform ye all
‚Ä≠  To swine, or wolves, or lions?  Never shall
‚Ä≠  Our heads get out, if once within we be,
‚Ä≠  But stay compell‚Äôd by strong necessity.
‚Ä≠  So wrought the Cyclop, when t‚Äô his cave our friends
‚Ä≠  This bold one led on, and brought all their ends
‚Ä≠  By his one indiscretion.·æø  I for this
‚Ä≠  Thought with my sword (that desp‚Äôrate head of his
‚Ä≠  Hewn from his neck) to gash upon the ground
‚Ä≠  His mangled body, though my blood was bound
‚Ä≠  In near alliance to him.  But the rest
‚Ä≠  With humble suit contain‚Äôd me, and request,
‚Ä≠  That I would leave him with my ship alone,
‚Ä≠  And to the sacred palace lead them on.
‚Ä≠     I led them; nor Eurylochus would stay
‚Ä≠  From their attendance on me, our late fray
‚Ä≠  Struck to his heart so.  But mean time, my men,
‚Ä≠  In Circe‚Äôs house, were all, in sev‚Äôral bain,
‚Ä≠  Studiously sweeten‚Äôd, smug‚Äôd with oil, and deck‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With in and out weeds, and a feast secret
‚Ä≠  Serv‚Äôd in before them; at which close we found
‚Ä≠  They all were set, cheer‚Äôd, and carousing round,
‚Ä≠  When mutual sight had, and all thought on, then
‚Ä≠  Feast was forgotten, and the moan again  [12]
‚Ä≠  About the house flew, driv‚Äôn with wings of joy.
‚Ä≠  But then spake Circe:  ‚ÄòNow, no more annoy,
‚Ä≠  I know myself what woes by sea, and shore,
‚Ä≠  And men unjust have plagued enough before
‚Ä≠  Your injur‚Äôd virtues.  Here then feast as long,
‚Ä≠  And be as cheerful, till ye grow as strong
‚Ä≠  As when ye first forsook your country-earth.
‚Ä≠  Ye now fare all like exiles; not a mirth,
‚Ä≠  Flash‚Äôd in amongst ye, but is quench‚Äôd again
‚Ä≠  With still-renew‚Äôd tears, though the beaten vein
‚Ä≠  Of your distresses should, me think, be now
‚Ä≠  Benumb with suff‚Äôrance.‚Äô  We did well allow
‚Ä≠  Her kind persuasions, and the whole year stay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In varied feast with her.  When, now array‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The world was with the spring, and orby hours
‚Ä≠  Had gone the round again through herbs and flow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  The months absolv‚Äôd in order, till the days
‚Ä≠  Had run their full race in Apollo‚Äôs rays;
‚Ä≠  My friends remember‚Äôd me of home, and said;
‚Ä≠  If ever fate would sign my pass, delay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  It should be now no more.  I heard them well,
‚Ä≠  Yet that day spent in feast, till darkness fell,
‚Ä≠  And sleep his virtues through our vapours shed.
‚Ä≠  When I ascended sacred Circe‚Äôs bed,
‚Ä≠  Implor‚Äôd my pass, and her perform√©d vow
‚Ä≠  Which now my soul urg‚Äôd, and my soldiers now
‚Ä≠  Afflicted me with tears to get them gone.
‚Ä≠  All these I told her, and she answer‚Äôd these:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúMuch-skill‚Äôd Ulysses Laertiades!
‚Ä≠  Remain no more against your wills with me,
‚Ä≠  But take your free way; only this must be
‚Ä≠  Perform‚Äôd before you steer your course for home:
‚Ä≠  You must the way to Pluto overcome,
‚Ä≠  And stern Persephon√©, to form your pass,
‚Ä≠  By th‚Äô aged Theban soul Tiresias,
‚Ä≠  The dark-brow‚Äôd prophet, whose soul yet can see
‚Ä≠  Clearly, and firmly; grave Persephon√©,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn dead, gave him a mind, that he alone
‚Ä≠  Might sing truth‚Äôs solid wisdom, and not one
‚Ä≠  Prove more than shade in his comparison.·æø
‚Ä≠     This broke my heart; I sunk into my bed,
‚Ä≠  Mourn‚Äôd, and would never more be comforted
‚Ä≠  With light, nor life.  But having now exprest
‚Ä≠  My pains enough to her in my unrest,
‚Ä≠  That so I might prepare her ruth, and get
‚Ä≠  All I held fit for an affair so great,
‚Ä≠  I said:  ‚ÄòO Circe, who shall steer my course
‚Ä≠  To Pluto‚Äôs kingdom?  Never ship had force
‚Ä≠  To make that voyage.‚Äô  The divine-in-voice
‚Ä≠  Said;  ‚ÄòSeek no guide, raise you your mast, and hoise
‚Ä≠  Your ship‚Äôs white sails, and then sit yon at peace,
‚Ä≠  The fresh North Spirit shall waft ye through the Seas.
‚Ä≠  But, having past the ocean, you shall see
‚Ä≠  A little shore, that to Persephon√©
‚Ä≠  Puts up a consecrated wood, where grows
‚Ä≠  Tall firs, and sallows that their fruits soon lose.
‚Ä≠  Cast anchor in the gulfs, and go alone
‚Ä≠  To Pluto‚Äôs dark house, where, to Acheron
‚Ä≠  Cocytus runs, and Pyriphlegethon,
‚Ä≠  Cocytus born of Styx, and where a rock
‚Ä≠  Of both the met floods bears the roaring shock.
‚Ä≠  The dark hero√´, great Tiresias,
‚Ä≠  Now coming near, to gain propitious pass,
‚Ä≠  Dig of a cubit ev‚Äôry way a pit,
‚Ä≠  And pour to all that are deceas‚Äôd in it
‚Ä≠  A solemn sacrifice.  For which, first take
‚Ä≠  Honey and wine, and their commixtion make;
‚Ä≠  Then sweet wine neat; and thirdly water pour;
‚Ä≠  And lastly add to these the whitest flour.
‚Ä≠  Then vow to all the weak necks of the dead
‚Ä≠  Off‚Äôrings a number; and, when thou shalt tread
‚Ä≠  The Ithacensian shore, to sacrifice
‚Ä≠  A heifer never-tam‚Äôd, and most of prize,
‚Ä≠  A pile of all thy most esteem√©d goods
‚Ä≠  Enflaming to the dear streams of their bloods;
‚Ä≠  And, in secret rites, to Tiresias vow
‚Ä≠  A ram coal-black at all parts, that doth flow
‚Ä≠  With fat and fleece, and all thy flocks doth lead.
‚Ä≠  When the all-calling nation of the dead  [13]
‚Ä≠  Thou thus hast pray‚Äôd to, offer on the place
‚Ä≠  A ram and ewe all black being turn‚Äôd in face
‚Ä≠  To dreadful Erebus, thyself aside
‚Ä≠  The flood‚Äôs shore walking.  And then, gratified
‚Ä≠  With flocks of souls of men and dames deceas‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Shall all thy pious rites be.  Straight address‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  See then the off‚Äôring that thy fellows slew,
‚Ä≠  Flay‚Äôd, and impos‚Äôd in fire; and all thy crew
‚Ä≠  Pray to the state of either Deity,
‚Ä≠  Grave Pluto, and severe Persephon√©.
‚Ä≠  Then draw thy sword, stand firm, nor suffer one
‚Ä≠  Of all the faint shades of the dead and gone
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô approach the blood, till thou hast heard their king,
‚Ä≠  The wise Tiresias; who thy offering
‚Ä≠  Will instantly do honour, thy home-ways,
‚Ä≠  And all the measure of them by the seas,
‚Ä≠  Amply unfolding.‚Äô  This the Goddess told;
‚Ä≠  And then the Morning in her throne of gold
‚Ä≠  Survey‚Äôd the vast world; by whose orient light
‚Ä≠  The Nymph adorn‚Äôd me with attires as bright,
‚Ä≠  Her own hands putting on both shirt and weed,
‚Ä≠  Robes fine, and curious, and upon my head
‚Ä≠  An ornament that glitter‚Äôd like a flame,
‚Ä≠  Girt me in gold; and forth betimes I came
‚Ä≠  Amongst my soldiers, rous‚Äôd them all from sleep,
‚Ä≠  And bad them now no more observance keep
‚Ä≠  Of ease, and feast, but straight a-shipboard fall,
‚Ä≠  For now the Goddess had inform‚Äôd me all.
‚Ä≠  Their noble spirits agreed; nor yet so clear
‚Ä≠  Could I bring all off, but Elpenor there
‚Ä≠  His heedless life left.  He was youngest man
‚Ä≠  Of all my company, and one that wan
‚Ä≠  Least fame for arms, as little for his brain;
‚Ä≠  Who (too much steep‚Äôd in wine, and so made fain
‚Ä≠  To get refreshing by the cool of sleep,
‚Ä≠  Apart his fellows, plung‚Äôd in vapours deep,
‚Ä≠  And they as high in tumult of their way)
‚Ä≠  Suddenly wak‚Äôd and (quite out of the stay
‚Ä≠  A sober mind had giv‚Äôn him) would descend
‚Ä≠  A huge long ladder, forward, and an end
‚Ä≠  Fell from the very roof, full pitching on
‚Ä≠  The dearest joint his head was plac‚Äôd upon,
‚Ä≠  Which, quite dissolv‚Äôd, let loose his soul to hell.
‚Ä≠  I to the rest, and Circe‚Äôs means did tell
‚Ä≠  Of our return, as crossing clean the hope
‚Ä≠  I gave them first, and said:  ‚ÄòYou think the scope
‚Ä≠  Of our endeavours now is straight for home;
‚Ä≠  No;  Circe otherwise design‚Äôd, whose doom
‚Ä≠  Enjoin‚Äôd us first to greet the dreadful house
‚Ä≠  Of austere Pluto and his glorious spouse,
‚Ä≠  To take the counsel of Tiresias,
‚Ä≠  The rev‚Äôrend Theban, to direct our pass.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This brake their hearts, and grief made tear their hair.
‚Ä≠  But grief was never good at great affair;
‚Ä≠  It would have way yet.  We went woful on
‚Ä≠  To ship and shore, where was arriv‚Äôd as soon
‚Ä≠  Circe unseen, a black ewe and a ram
‚Ä≠  Binding for sacrifice, and, as she came,
‚Ä≠  Vanish‚Äôd again unwitness‚Äôd by our eyes;
‚Ä≠  Which griev‚Äôd not us, nor check‚Äôd our sacrifice,
‚Ä≠  For who would see God, loth to let us see,
‚Ä≠  This way or that bent; still his ways are free.

‚Ä≠[2] This place suffers different construction in all the Commentors:

‚Ä≠places (which yet I want time to approve) especially about _·ºêŒ≥Œ≥·Ω∫œÇ

‚Ä≠which _·ºêŒ≥Œ≥·Ω∫œÇ_ signifies) which they will have to be understood, that
‚Ä≠the days in that region are long, and the nights short; where Homer
‚Ä≠intends, that the equinoctial is there; for how else is the course of
‚Ä≠day and night near or equal?  But therefore the night‚Äôs-man hath his
‚Ä≠double hire, being as long about his charge as the other; and the
‚Ä≠night being more dangerous, etc.  And if the day were so long, why
‚Ä≠should the night‚Äôs-man be preferred in wages?

‚Ä≠  THE ELEVENTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Ulysees‚Äô way to Hell appears;
‚Ä≠  Where he the grave Tiresias hears;
‚Ä≠  Enquires his own and others‚Äô fates;
‚Ä≠  His mother sees, and th‚Äô after states
‚Ä≠  In which were held by sad decease
‚Ä≠  Hero√´s, and Heroesses,
‚Ä≠  A number, that at Troy wag‚Äôd war;
‚Ä≠  As Ajax that was still at jar
‚Ä≠  With Ithacus, for th‚Äô arms he lost;
‚Ä≠  And with the great Achilles‚Äô ghost.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _Œõ·Ω±ŒΩŒ≤Œ¥Œ±._
‚Ä≠     Ulysses here
‚Ä≠        Invokes the dead,
‚Ä≠     The lives appear
‚Ä≠        Hereafter led.

‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúArriv‚Äôd now at our ship, we launch‚Äôd, and set
‚Ä≠  Our mast up, put forth sail, and in did get
‚Ä≠  Our late-got cattle.  Up our sails, we went,
‚Ä≠  My wayward fellows mourning now th‚Äô event.  [1]
‚Ä≠  A good companion yet, a foreright wind,
‚Ä≠  Circe (the excellent utt‚Äôrer of her mind)
‚Ä≠  Supplied our murmuring consorts with, that was
‚Ä≠  Both speed and guide to our adventurous pass.
‚Ä≠  All day our sails stood to the winds, and made
‚Ä≠  Our voyage prosp‚Äôrous.  Sun then set, and shade
‚Ä≠  All ways obscuring, on the bounds we fell
‚Ä≠  Of deep Oceanus, where people dwell
‚Ä≠  Whom a perpetual cloud obscures outright,
‚Ä≠  To whom the cheerful sun lends never light,
‚Ä≠  Nor when he mounts the star-sustaining heaven,
‚Ä≠  Nor when he stoops earth, and sets up the even,
‚Ä≠  But night holds fix‚Äôd wings, feather‚Äôd all with banes,
‚Ä≠  Above those most unblest Cimmerians.
‚Ä≠  Here drew we up our ship, our sheep withdrew,
‚Ä≠  And walk‚Äôd the shore till we attain‚Äôd the view,
‚Ä≠  Of that sad region Circe had foreshow‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  And then the sacred off‚Äôrings to be vow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Eurylochus and Persimedes bore.
‚Ä≠  When I my sword drew, and earth‚Äôs womb did gore
‚Ä≠  Till I a pit digg‚Äôd of a cubit round,
‚Ä≠  Which with the liquid sacrifice we crown‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  First honey mix‚Äôd with wine, then sweet wine neat,
‚Ä≠  Then water pour‚Äôd in, last the flour of wheat.
‚Ä≠  Much I importun‚Äôd then the weak-neck‚Äôd dead,
‚Ä≠  And vow‚Äôd, when I the barren soil should tread
‚Ä≠  Of clifty Ithaca, amidst my hall
‚Ä≠  To kill a heifer, my clear best of all,
‚Ä≠  And give in off‚Äôring, on a pile compos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of all the choice goods my whole house enclos‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  And to Tiresias himself, alone,
‚Ä≠  A sheep coal-black, and the selectest one
‚Ä≠  Of all my flocks.  When to the Pow‚Äôrs beneath,
‚Ä≠  The sacred nation that survive with death,
‚Ä≠  My pray‚Äôrs and vows had done devotions fit,
‚Ä≠  I took the off‚Äôrings, and upon the pit
‚Ä≠  Bereft their lives.  Out gush‚Äôd the sable blood,
‚Ä≠  And round about me fled out of the flood
‚Ä≠  The souls of the deceas‚Äôd.  There cluster‚Äôd then
‚Ä≠  Youths, and their wives, much-suff‚Äôring aged men,
‚Ä≠  Soft tender virgins that but new came there
‚Ä≠  By timeless death, and green their sorrows were.
‚Ä≠  There men-at-arms, with armours all embrew‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Wounded with lances, and with faulchions hew‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  In numbers, up and down the ditch, did stalk,
‚Ä≠  And threw unmeasur‚Äôd cries about their walk,
‚Ä≠  So horrid that a bloodless fear surpris‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  My daunted spirits.  Straight then I advis‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  My friends to flay the slaughter‚Äôd sacrifice,
‚Ä≠  Put them in fire, and to the Deities,
‚Ä≠  Stern Pluto and Persephon√©, apply
‚Ä≠  Exciteful pray‚Äôrs.  Then drew I from my thigh
‚Ä≠  My well-edg‚Äôd sword, stept in, and firmly stood
‚Ä≠  Betwixt the prease of shadows and the blood,
‚Ä≠  And would not suffer anyone to dip
‚Ä≠  Within our off‚Äôring his unsolid lip,
‚Ä≠  Before Tiresias that did all controul.
‚Ä≠  The first that press‚Äôd in was Elpenor‚Äôs soul,
‚Ä≠  His body in the broad-way‚Äôd earth as yet
‚Ä≠  Unmourn‚Äôd, unburied by us, since we swet
‚Ä≠  With other urgent labours.  Yet his smart
‚Ä≠  I wept to see, and rued it from my heart,
‚Ä≠  Enquiring how he could before me be
‚Ä≠  That came by ship?  He, mourning, answer‚Äôd me:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòIn Circe‚Äôs house, the spite some spirit did bear,
‚Ä≠  And the unspeakable good liquor there,
‚Ä≠  Hath been my bane; for, being to descend
‚Ä≠  A ladder much in height, I did not tend
‚Ä≠  My way well down, but forwards made a proof
‚Ä≠  To tread the rounds, and from the very roof
‚Ä≠  Fell on my neck, and brake it; and this made
‚Ä≠  My soul thus visit this infernal shade.
‚Ä≠  And here, by them that next thyself are dear,
‚Ä≠  Thy wife, and father, that a little one
‚Ä≠  Gave food to thee, and by thy only son
‚Ä≠  At home behind thee left, Telemachus,
‚Ä≠  Do not depart by stealth, and leave me thus,
‚Ä≠  Unmourn‚Äôd, unburied, lest neglected I
‚Ä≠  Bring on thyself th‚Äô incens√©d Deity.
‚Ä≠  I know that, sail‚Äôd from hence, thy ship must touch
‚Ä≠  On th‚Äô isle √Ü√¶a; where vouchsafe thus much,
‚Ä≠  Good king, that, landed, thou wilt instantly
‚Ä≠  Bestow on me thy royal memory
‚Ä≠  To this grace, that my body, arms and all,
‚Ä≠  May rest consum‚Äôd in fiery funeral;
‚Ä≠  And on the foamy shore a sepulchre
‚Ä≠  Erect to me, that after-times may hear
‚Ä≠  Of one so hapless.  Let me these implore
‚Ä≠  And fix upon my sepulchre the oar  [2]
‚Ä≠  With which alive I shook the aged seas,
‚Ä≠  And had of friends the dear societies.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     I told the wretched soul I would fulfill
‚Ä≠  And execute to th‚Äô utmost point his will;
‚Ä≠  And, all the time we sadly talk‚Äôd, I still
‚Ä≠  My sword above the blood held, when aside
‚Ä≠  The idol of my friend still amplified
‚Ä≠  His plaint, as up and down the shades he err‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Then my deceas√©d mother‚Äôs soul appear‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Fair daughter of Autolycus the great,
‚Ä≠  Grave Anticlea, whom, when forth I set
‚Ä≠  For sacred Ilion, I had left alive.
‚Ä≠  Her sight much mov‚Äôd me, and to tears did drive
‚Ä≠  My note of her decease; and yet not she
‚Ä≠  (Though in my ruth she held the high‚Äôst degree)
‚Ä≠  Would I admit to touch the sacred blood,
‚Ä≠  Till from Tiresias I had understood
‚Ä≠  What Circe told me.  At the length did land
‚Ä≠  Theban Tiresias‚Äô soul, and in his hand
‚Ä≠  Sustain‚Äôd a golden sceptre, knew me well,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄòO man unhappy, why to hell
‚Ä≠  Admitt‚Äôst thou dark arrival, and the light
‚Ä≠  The sun gives leav‚Äôst, to have the horrid sight
‚Ä≠  Of this black region, and the shadows here?
‚Ä≠  Now sheathe thy sharp sword, and the pit forbear,
‚Ä≠  That I the blood may taste, and then relate
‚Ä≠  The truth of those acts that affect thy fate.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     I sheath‚Äôd my sword, and left the pit, till he,
‚Ä≠  The black blood tasting, thus instructed me:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòRenown‚Äôd Ulysses!  All unask‚Äôd I know
‚Ä≠  That all the cause of thy arrival now
‚Ä≠  Is to enquire thy wish‚Äôd retreat for home;
‚Ä≠  Which hardly God will let thee overcome,
‚Ä≠  Since Neptune still will his opposure try,
‚Ä≠  With all his laid-up anger, for the eye
‚Ä≠  His lov‚Äôd son lost to thee.  And yet through all
‚Ä≠  Thy suff‚Äôring course (which must be capital)
‚Ä≠  If both thine own affections, and thy friends,
‚Ä≠  Thou wilt contain, when thy access ascends
‚Ä≠  The three-fork‚Äôd island, having ‚Äòscap‚Äôd the seas,
‚Ä≠  Where ye shall find fed on the flow‚Äôry leas
‚Ä≠  Fat flocks, and oxen, which the Sun doth own,
‚Ä≠  To whom are all things as well heard as shown,
‚Ä≠  And never dare one head of those to slay,
‚Ä≠  But hold unharmful on your wish√©d way,
‚Ä≠  Though through enough affliction, yet secure
‚Ä≠  Your Fates shall land ye; but presage says sure,
‚Ä≠  If once ye spoil them, spoil to all thy friends,
‚Ä≠  Spoil to thy fleet, and if the justice ends
‚Ä≠  Short of thyself, it shall be long before,
‚Ä≠  And that length forc‚Äôd out with inflictions store,
‚Ä≠  When, losing all thy fellows, in a sail
‚Ä≠  Of foreign built (when most thy Fates prevail
‚Ä≠  In thy deliv‚Äôrance) thus th‚Äô event shall sort:
‚Ä≠  Thou shalt find shipwrack raging in thy port,
‚Ä≠  Proud men thy goods consuming, and thy wife
‚Ä≠  Urging with gifts, give charge upon thy life.
‚Ä≠  But all these wrongs revenge shall end to thee,
‚Ä≠  And force, or cunning, set with slaughter free
‚Ä≠  The house of all thy spoilers.  Yet again
‚Ä≠  Thou shalt a voyage make, and come to men
‚Ä≠  That know no sea, nor ships, nor oars that are
‚Ä≠  Wings to a ship, nor mix with any fare  [3]
‚Ä≠  Salt‚Äôs savoury vapour.  Where thou first shalt land,
‚Ä≠  This clear-giv‚Äôn sign shall let thee understand,
‚Ä≠  That there those men remain:  Assume ashore
‚Ä≠  Up to thy royal shoulder a ship oar,
‚Ä≠  With which, when thou shalt meet one on the way
‚Ä≠  That will in county admiration say
‚Ä≠  What dost thou with that wan upon thy neck?
‚Ä≠  There fix that wan thy oar, and that shore deck
‚Ä≠  With sacred rites to Neptune; slaughter there
‚Ä≠  A ram, a bull, and (who for strength doth bear
‚Ä≠  The name of husband to a herd) a boar.
‚Ä≠  And, coming home, upon thy natural shore,
‚Ä≠  Give pious hecatombs to all the Gods,
‚Ä≠  Degrees observ‚Äôd.  And then the periods
‚Ä≠  Of all thy labours in the peace shall end
‚Ä≠  Of easy death; which shall the less extend
‚Ä≠  His passion to thee, that thy foe, the Sea,
‚Ä≠  Shall not enforce it, but Death‚Äôs victory
‚Ä≠  Shall chance in only-earnest-pray-vow‚Äôd age,  [4]
‚Ä≠  Obtain‚Äôd at home, quite emptied of his rage,
‚Ä≠  Thy subjects round about thee, rich and blest.
‚Ä≠  And here hath Truth summ‚Äôd up thy vital rest.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     I answer‚Äôd him:  ‚ÄòWe will suppose all these
‚Ä≠  Decreed in Deity; let it likewise please
‚Ä≠  Tiresias to resolve me, why so near
‚Ä≠  The blood and me my mother‚Äôs soul doth bear,
‚Ä≠  And yet nor word, nor look, vouchsafe her son?
‚Ä≠  Doth she not know me?‚Äô  ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô  said he,  ‚Äònor none
‚Ä≠  Of all these spirits, but myself alone,
‚Ä≠  Knows anything till he shall taste the blood.
‚Ä≠  But whomsoever you shall do that good,
‚Ä≠  He will the truth of all you wish unfold;
‚Ä≠  Who you envy it to will all withhold.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     Thus said the kingly soul, and made retreat
‚Ä≠  Amidst the inner parts of Pluto‚Äôs seat,
‚Ä≠  When he had spoke thus by divine instinct.
‚Ä≠  Still I stood firm, till to the blood‚Äôs precinct
‚Ä≠  My mother came, and drunk; and then she knew
‚Ä≠  I was her son, had passion to renew
‚Ä≠  Her natural plaints, which thus she did pursue:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòHow is it, O my son, that you alive
‚Ä≠  This deadly-darksome region underdive?
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTwixt which, and earth, so many mighty seas,
‚Ä≠  And horrid currents, interpose their prease,
‚Ä≠  Oceanus in chief?  Which none (unless
‚Ä≠  More help‚Äôd than you) on foot now can transgress.
‚Ä≠  A well-built ship he needs that ventures there.
‚Ä≠  Com‚Äôst thou from Troy but now, enforc‚Äôd to err
‚Ä≠  All this time with thy soldiers?  Nor hast seen,
‚Ä≠  Ere this long day, thy country, and thy queen?‚Äô
‚Ä≠     I answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄòThat a necessary end
‚Ä≠  To this infernal state made me contend;
‚Ä≠  That from the wise Tiresias‚Äô Theban soul
‚Ä≠  I might an oracle involv‚Äôd unroll;
‚Ä≠  For I came nothing near Achaia yet,
‚Ä≠  Nor on our lov‚Äôd earth happy foot had set,
‚Ä≠  But, mishaps suff‚Äôring, err‚Äôd from coast to coast,
‚Ä≠  Ever since first the mighty Grecian host
‚Ä≠  Divine Atrides led to Ilion,
‚Ä≠  And I his follower, to set war upon
‚Ä≠  The rapeful Trojans; and so pray‚Äôd she would
‚Ä≠  The fate of that ungentle death unfold,
‚Ä≠  That forc‚Äôd her thither; if some long disease,
‚Ä≠  Or that the spleen of her-that-arrows-please,
‚Ä≠  Diana, envious of most eminent dames,
‚Ä≠  Had made her th‚Äô object of her deadly aims?
‚Ä≠  My father‚Äôs state and sons I sought, if they
‚Ä≠  Kept still my goods?  Or they became the prey
‚Ä≠  Of any other, holding me no more
‚Ä≠  In pow‚Äôr of safe return?  Or if my store
‚Ä≠  My wife had kept together with her son?
‚Ä≠  If she her first mind held, or had been won
‚Ä≠  By some chief Grecian from my love and bed?‚Äô
‚Ä≠     All this she answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄòThat affliction fed
‚Ä≠  On her blood still at home, and that to grief
‚Ä≠  She all the days and darkness of her life
‚Ä≠  In tears had consecrate.  That none possest
‚Ä≠  My famous kingdom‚Äôs throne, but th‚Äô interest
‚Ä≠  My son had in it still he held in peace,
‚Ä≠  A court kept like a prince, and his increase
‚Ä≠  Spent in his subjects‚Äô good, administ‚Äôring laws
‚Ä≠  With justice, and the general applause
‚Ä≠  A king should merit, and all call‚Äôd him king.
‚Ä≠  My father kept the upland, labouring,
‚Ä≠  And shunn‚Äôd the city, us‚Äôd no sumptuous beds,
‚Ä≠  Wonder‚Äôd-at furnitures, nor wealthy weeds,
‚Ä≠  But in the winter strew‚Äôd about the fire
‚Ä≠  Lay with his slaves in ashes, his attire
‚Ä≠  Like to a beggar‚Äôs; when the summer came,
‚Ä≠  And autumn all fruits ripen‚Äôd with his flame,
‚Ä≠  Where grape-charg‚Äôd vines made shadows most abound,
‚Ä≠  His couch with fall‚Äôn leaves made upon the ground,
‚Ä≠  And here lay he, his sorrow‚Äôs fruitful state
‚Ä≠  Increasing as he faded for my fate;
‚Ä≠  And now the part of age that irksome is
‚Ä≠  Lay sadly on him.  And that life of his
‚Ä≠  She led, and perish‚Äôd in; not slaughter‚Äôd by
‚Ä≠  The Dame that darts lov‚Äôd, and her archery;
‚Ä≠  Nor by disease invaded, vast and foul,
‚Ä≠  That wastes the body, and sends out the soul
‚Ä≠  With shame and horror; only in her moan,
‚Ä≠  For me and my life, she consum‚Äôd her own.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     She thus, when I had great desire to prove
‚Ä≠  My arms the circle where her soul did move.
‚Ä≠  Thrice prov‚Äôd I, thrice she vanish‚Äôd like a sleep,
‚Ä≠  Or fleeting shadow, which struck much more deep
‚Ä≠  The wounds my woes made, and made ask her why
‚Ä≠  She would my love to her embraces fly,
‚Ä≠  And not vouchsafe that ev‚Äôn in hell we might
‚Ä≠  Pay pious Nature her unalter‚Äôd right,
‚Ä≠  And give Vexation here her cruel fill?
‚Ä≠  Should not the Queen here, to augment the ill
‚Ä≠  Of ev‚Äôry suff‚Äôrance, which her office is,
‚Ä≠  Enforce thy idol to afford me this?
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄòO son,‚Äô  she answer‚Äôd,  ‚Äòof the race of men
‚Ä≠  The most unhappy, our most equal Queen
‚Ä≠  Will mock no solid arms with empty shade,
‚Ä≠  Nor suffer empty shades again t‚Äô invade
‚Ä≠  Flesh, bones, and nerves; nor will defraud the fire
‚Ä≠  Of his last dues, that, soon as spirits expire
‚Ä≠  And leave the white bone, are his native right,
‚Ä≠  When, like a dream, the soul assumes her flight.
‚Ä≠  The light then of the living with most haste,
‚Ä≠  O son, contend to.  This thy little taste
‚Ä≠  Of this state is enough; and all this life
‚Ä≠  Will make a tale fit to be told thy wife.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This speech we had; when now repair‚Äôd to me
‚Ä≠  More female spirits, by Persephon√©
‚Ä≠  Driv‚Äôn on before her.  All th‚Äô hero√´s‚Äô wives,
‚Ä≠  And daughters, that led there their second lives,
‚Ä≠  About the black blood throng‚Äôd.  Of whom yet more
‚Ä≠  My mind impell‚Äôd me to inquire, before
‚Ä≠  I let them all together taste the gore,
‚Ä≠  For then would all have been dispers‚Äôd, and gone
‚Ä≠  Thick as they came.  I, therefore, one by one
‚Ä≠  Let taste the pit, my sword drawn from my thigh,
‚Ä≠  And stand betwixt them made, when, sev‚Äôrally,
‚Ä≠  All told their stocks.  The first, that quench‚Äôd her fire,
‚Ä≠  Was Tyro, issued of a noble sire.
‚Ä≠  She said she sprung from pure Salmoneus‚Äô bed,
‚Ä≠  And Cretheus, son of √Üolus, did wed;
‚Ä≠  Yet the divine flood Enip√´us lov‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Who much the most fair stream of all floods mov‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Near whose streams Tyro walking, Neptune came,
‚Ä≠  Like Enip√´us, and enjoy‚Äôd the dame.
‚Ä≠  Like to a hill, the blue and snaky flood
‚Ä≠  Above th‚Äô immortal and the mortal stood,
‚Ä≠  And hid them both, as both together lay,
‚Ä≠  Just where his current falls into the sea.
‚Ä≠  Her virgin waist dissolv‚Äôd, she slumber‚Äôd then;
‚Ä≠  But when the God had done the work of men,
‚Ä≠  Her fair hand gently wringing, thus he said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòWoman!  rejoice in our combin√©d bed,
‚Ä≠  For when the year hath run his circle round
‚Ä≠  (Because the Gods‚Äô loves must in fruit abound)
‚Ä≠  My love shall make, to cheer thy teeming moans,
‚Ä≠  Thy one dear burden bear two famous sons;
‚Ä≠  Love well, and bring them up.  Go home, and see
‚Ä≠  That, though of more joy yet I shall be free,
‚Ä≠  Thou dost not tell, to glorify thy birth;
‚Ä≠  Thy love is Neptune, shaker of the earth.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  This said, he plung‚Äôd into the sea; and she,
‚Ä≠  Begot with child by him, the light let see
‚Ä≠  Great Pelias, and Neleus, that became
‚Ä≠  In Jove‚Äôs great ministry of mighty fame.
‚Ä≠  Pelias in broad Iolcus held his throne,
‚Ä≠  Wealthy in cattle; th‚Äô other royal son
‚Ä≠  Rul‚Äôd sandy Pylos.  To these issue more
‚Ä≠  This queen of women to her husband bore,
‚Ä≠  √Üson, and Pheres, and Amythaon
‚Ä≠  That for his fight on horseback stoop‚Äôd to none.
‚Ä≠     Next her, I saw admir‚Äôd Antiope,
‚Ä≠  Asopus‚Äô daughter, who (as much as she
‚Ä≠  Boasted attraction of great Neptune‚Äôs love)
‚Ä≠  Boasted to slumber in the arms of Jove,
‚Ä≠  And two sons likewise at one burden bore
‚Ä≠  To that her all-controlling paramour,
‚Ä≠  Amphion, and fair Zethus; that first laid
‚Ä≠  Great Thebes‚Äô foundations, and strong walls convey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  About her turrets, that seven ports enclos‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  For though the Thebans much in strength repos‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Yet had not they the strength to hold their own,
‚Ä≠  Without the added aids of wood and stone.
‚Ä≠     Alcmena next I saw, that famous wife
‚Ä≠  Was to Amphitryo, and honour‚Äôd life
‚Ä≠  Gave to the lion-hearted Hercules,
‚Ä≠  That was of Jove‚Äôs embrace the great increase.
‚Ä≠     I saw, besides, proud Creon‚Äôs daughter there,
‚Ä≠  Bright Megara, that nuptial yoke did wear
‚Ä≠  With Jove‚Äôs great son, who never field did try
‚Ä≠  But bore to him the flow‚Äôr of victory.
‚Ä≠     The mother then of ≈ídipus I saw,
‚Ä≠  Fair Epicasta, that, beyond all law,
‚Ä≠  Her own son married, ignorant of kind.
‚Ä≠  And he, as darkly taken in his mind,
‚Ä≠  His mother wedded, and his father slew.
‚Ä≠  Whose blind act Heav‚Äôn expos‚Äôd at length to view,
‚Ä≠  And he in all-lov‚Äôd Thebes the supreme state
‚Ä≠  With much moan manag‚Äôd, for the heavy fate
‚Ä≠  The Gods laid on him.  She made violent flight
‚Ä≠  To Pluto‚Äôs dark house from the loath√©d light,
‚Ä≠  Beneath a steep beam strangled with a cord,
‚Ä≠  And left her son, in life, pains as abhorr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  As all the Furies pour‚Äôd on her in hell.
‚Ä≠  Then saw I Chloris, that did so excell
‚Ä≠  In answering beauties, that each part had all.
‚Ä≠  Great Neleus married her, when gifts not small
‚Ä≠  Had won her favour, term‚Äôd by name of dow‚Äôr.
‚Ä≠  She was of all Amphion‚Äôs seed the flow‚Äôr;
‚Ä≠  Amphion, call‚Äôd Iasides, that then
‚Ä≠  Rul‚Äôd strongly Myni√¶an Orchomen,
‚Ä≠  And now his daughter rul‚Äôd the Pylian throne,
‚Ä≠  Because her beauty‚Äôs empire overshone.
‚Ä≠  She brought her wife-awed husband, Nele√∫s,
‚Ä≠  Nestor much honour‚Äôd, Periclymenus,
‚Ä≠  And Chromius, sons with sov‚Äôreign virtues grac‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  But after brought a daughter that surpass‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Rare-beautied Pero, so for form exact
‚Ä≠  That Nature to a miracle was rack‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In her perfections, blaz‚Äôd with th‚Äô eyes of men;
‚Ä≠  That made of all the country‚Äôs hearts a chain,
‚Ä≠  And drew them suitors to her.  Which her sire
‚Ä≠  Took vantage of, and, since he did aspire
‚Ä≠  To nothing more than to the broad-brow‚Äôd herd
‚Ä≠  Of oxen, which the common fame so rear‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Own‚Äôd by Iphiclus, not a man should be
‚Ä≠  His Pero‚Äôs husband, that from Phylace
‚Ä≠  Those never-yet-driv‚Äôn oxen could not drive.
‚Ä≠  Yet these a strong hope held him to achieve,
‚Ä≠  Because a prophet, that had never err‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Had said, that only he should be preferr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To their possession.  But the equal fate
‚Ä≠  Of God withstood his stealth; inextricate
‚Ä≠  Imprisoning bands, and sturdy churlish swains
‚Ä≠  That were the herdsmen, who withheld with chains
‚Ä≠  The stealth-attempter; which was only he
‚Ä≠  That durst abet the act with prophecy,
‚Ä≠  None else would undertake it, and he must;
‚Ä≠  The king would needs a prophet should be just.
‚Ä≠  But when some days and months expired were,
‚Ä≠  And all the hours had brought about the year,
‚Ä≠  The prophet did so satisfy the king
‚Ä≠  (Iphiclus, all his cunning questioning)
‚Ä≠  That he enfranchis‚Äôd him; and, all worst done,
‚Ä≠  Jove‚Äôs counsel made th‚Äô all-safe conclusi√≥n.
‚Ä≠     Then saw I Leda, link‚Äôd in nuptial chain
‚Ä≠  With Tyndarus, to whom she did sustain
‚Ä≠  Sons much renown‚Äôd for wisdom; Castor one,
‚Ä≠  That pass‚Äôd for use of horse comparison;
‚Ä≠  And Pollux, that excell‚Äôd in whirlbat fight;
‚Ä≠  Both these the fruitful earth bore, while the light
‚Ä≠  Of life inspir‚Äôd them; after which, they found
‚Ä≠  Such grace with Jove, that both liv‚Äôd under ground,
‚Ä≠  By change of days; life still did one sustain,
‚Ä≠  While th‚Äô other died; the dead then liv‚Äôd again,
‚Ä≠  The living dying; both of one self date
‚Ä≠  Their lives and deaths made by the Gods and Fate.
‚Ä≠     Iphimedia after Leda came,
‚Ä≠  That did derive from Neptune too the name
‚Ä≠  Of father to two admirable sons.
‚Ä≠  Life yet made short their admirati√≥ns,
‚Ä≠  Who God-oppos√©d Otus had to name,
‚Ä≠  And Ephialtes far in sound of fame.
‚Ä≠  The prodigal earth so fed them, that they grew
‚Ä≠  To most huge stature, and had fairest hue
‚Ä≠  Of all men, but Orion, under heav‚Äôn.
‚Ä≠  At nine years old nine cubits they were driv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  Abroad in breadth, and sprung nine fathoms high.
‚Ä≠  They threaten‚Äôd to give battle to the sky,
‚Ä≠  And all th‚Äô Immortals.  They were setting on
‚Ä≠  Ossa upon Olympus, and upon
‚Ä≠  Steep Ossa leavy Pelius, that ev‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  They might a highway make with lofty heav‚Äôn;
‚Ä≠  And had perhaps perform‚Äôd it, had they liv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Till they were striplings; but Jove‚Äôs son depriv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Their limbs of life, before th‚Äô age that begins
‚Ä≠  The flow‚Äôr of youth, and should adorn their chins.
‚Ä≠     Ph√¶dra and Procris, with wise Minos‚Äô flame,
‚Ä≠  Bright Ariadne, to the off‚Äôring came.
‚Ä≠  Whom whilome Theseus made his prise from Crete,
‚Ä≠  That Athens‚Äô sacred soil might kiss her feet,
‚Ä≠  But never could obtain her virgin flow‚Äôr,
‚Ä≠  Till, in the sea-girt Dia, Dian‚Äôs pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  Detain‚Äôd his homeward haste, where (in her fane,
‚Ä≠  By Bacchus witness‚Äôd) was the fatal wane
‚Ä≠  Of her prime glory, M√¶ra, Clymene,
‚Ä≠  I witness‚Äôd there; and loath‚Äôd Eriphyle,
‚Ä≠  That honour‚Äôd gold more than she lov‚Äôd her spouse.  [5]
‚Ä≠     But, all th‚Äô heroesses in Pluto‚Äôs house
‚Ä≠  That then encounter‚Äôd me, exceeds my might
‚Ä≠  To name or number, and ambrosian night
‚Ä≠  Would quite be spent, when now the formal hours
‚Ä≠  Present to sleep our all dispos√©d pow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  If at my ship, or here.  My home-made vow
‚Ä≠  I leave for fit grace to the Gods and you.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said; the silence his discourse had made
‚Ä≠  With pleasure held still through the house‚Äôs shade,
‚Ä≠  When white-arm‚Äôd Aret√© this speech began:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúPh√¶acians!  How appears to you this man,
‚Ä≠  So goodly person‚Äôd, and so match‚Äôd with mind?
‚Ä≠  My guest he is, but all you stand combin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In the renown he doth us.  Do not then
‚Ä≠  With careless haste dismiss him, nor the main
‚Ä≠  Of his dispatch to one so needy maim,
‚Ä≠  The Gods‚Äô free bounty gives us all just claim
‚Ä≠  To goods enow.‚Äù  This speech, the oldest man
‚Ä≠  Of any other Ph√¶acensian,
‚Ä≠  The grave hero√´, Echin√´us, gave
‚Ä≠  All approbation, saying:  ‚ÄúFriends!  ye have
‚Ä≠  The motion of the wise queen in such words
‚Ä≠  As have not miss‚Äôd the mark, with which accords
‚Ä≠  My clear opinion.  But Alcinous,
‚Ä≠  In word and work, must be our rule.‚Äù  He thus;
‚Ä≠  And then Alcinous said:  ‚ÄúThis then must stand,
‚Ä≠  If while I live I rule in the command
‚Ä≠  Of this well-skill‚Äôd-in-navigation state:
‚Ä≠  Endure then, guest, though most importunate
‚Ä≠  Be your affects for home.  A little stay
‚Ä≠  If your expectance bear, perhaps it may
‚Ä≠  Our gifts make more complete.  The cares of all
‚Ä≠  Your due deduction asks; but principal
‚Ä≠  I am therein the ruler.‚Äù  He replied:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúAlcinous, the most duly glorified
‚Ä≠  With rule of all of all men, if you lay
‚Ä≠  Commandment on me of a whole year‚Äôs stay,
‚Ä≠  So all the while your preparations rise,
‚Ä≠  As well in gifts as time,  [6]  ye can devise
‚Ä≠  No better wish for me; for I shall come
‚Ä≠  Much fuller-handed, and more honoured, home,
‚Ä≠  And dearer to my people, in whose loves
‚Ä≠  The richer evermore the better proves.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúThere is argued in your sight
‚Ä≠  A worth that works not men for benefit,
‚Ä≠  Like prollers or impostors; of which crew,
‚Ä≠  The gentle black earth feeds not up a few,
‚Ä≠  Here and there wand‚Äôrers, blanching tales and lies,
‚Ä≠  Of neither praise, nor use.  You move our eyes
‚Ä≠  With form, our minds with matter, and our ears
‚Ä≠  With elegant oration, such as bears
‚Ä≠  A music in the order‚Äôd history
‚Ä≠  It lays before us.  Not Demodocus
‚Ä≠  With sweeter strains hath us‚Äôd to sing to us
‚Ä≠  All the Greek sorrows, wept out in your own.
‚Ä≠  But say:  Of all your worthy friends, were none
‚Ä≠  Objected to your eyes that consorts were
‚Ä≠  To Ilion with you, and serv‚Äôd destiny there?
‚Ä≠  This night is passing long, unmeasur‚Äôd, none
‚Ä≠  Of all my household would to bed yet; on,
‚Ä≠  Relate these wondrous things.  Were I with you,
‚Ä≠  If you would tell me but your woes, as now,
‚Ä≠  Till the divine Aurora show‚Äôd her head,
‚Ä≠  I should in no night relish thought of bed.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúMost eminent king,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äútimes all must keep,
‚Ä≠  There‚Äôs time to speak much, time as much to sleep.
‚Ä≠  But would you hear still, I will tell you still,
‚Ä≠  And utter more, more miserable ill
‚Ä≠  Of friends than yet, that scap‚Äôd the dismal wars,
‚Ä≠  And perish‚Äôd homewards, and in household jars
‚Ä≠  Wag‚Äôd by a wicked woman.  The chaste Queen
‚Ä≠  No sooner made these lady ghosts unseen,
‚Ä≠  Here and there flitting, but mine eyesight won
‚Ä≠  The soul of Agamemnon, Atreus‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  Sad, and about him all his train of friends,
‚Ä≠  That in √Ügisthus‚Äô house endur‚Äôd their ends
‚Ä≠  With his stern fortune.  Having drunk the blood,
‚Ä≠  He knew me instantly, and forth a flood
‚Ä≠  Of springing tears gush‚Äôd; out he thrust his hands,
‚Ä≠  With will t‚Äô embrace me, but their old commands
‚Ä≠  Flow‚Äôd not about him, nor their weakest part.
‚Ä≠  I wept to see, and moan‚Äôd him from my heart,
‚Ä≠  And ask‚Äôd:  ‚ÄòO Agamemnon!  King of men!
‚Ä≠  What sort of cruel death hath render‚Äôd slain
‚Ä≠  Thy royal person?  Neptune in thy fleet
‚Ä≠  Heav‚Äôn and his hellish billows making meet,
‚Ä≠  Rousing the winds?  Or have thy men by land
‚Ä≠  Done thee this ill, for using thy command,
‚Ä≠  Past their consents, in diminution
‚Ä≠  Of those full shares their worths by lot had won
‚Ä≠  Of sheep or oxen?  Or of any town,
‚Ä≠  In covetous strife, to make their rights thine own
‚Ä≠  In men or women prisoners?‚Äô  He replied:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòBy none of these in any right I died,
‚Ä≠  But by √Ügisthus and my murd‚Äôrous wife
‚Ä≠  (Bid to a banquet at his house) my life
‚Ä≠  Hath thus been reft me, to my slaughter led
‚Ä≠  Like to an ox pretended to be fed.
‚Ä≠  So miserably fell I, and with me
‚Ä≠  My friends lay massacred, as when you see
‚Ä≠  At any rich man‚Äôs nuptials, shot, or feast,
‚Ä≠  About his kitchen white-tooth‚Äôd swine lie drest.
‚Ä≠  The slaughters of a world of men thine eyes,
‚Ä≠  Both private, and in prease of enemies,
‚Ä≠  Have personally witness‚Äôd; but this one
‚Ä≠  Would all thy parts have broken into moan,
‚Ä≠  To see how strew‚Äôd about our cups and cates,
‚Ä≠  As tables set with feast, so we with fates,
‚Ä≠  All gash‚Äôd and slain lay, all the floor embrued
‚Ä≠  With blood and brain.  But that which most I rued,
‚Ä≠  Flew from the heavy voice that Priam‚Äôs seed,
‚Ä≠  Cassandra, breath‚Äôd, whom, she that wit doth feed
‚Ä≠  With baneful crafts, false Clytemnestra, slew,
‚Ä≠  Close sitting by me; up my hands I threw
‚Ä≠  From earth to heav‚Äôn, and tumbling on my sword
‚Ä≠  Gave wretched life up; when the most abhorr‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  By all her sex‚Äôs shame, forsook the room,
‚Ä≠  Nor deign‚Äôd, though then so near this heavy home,
‚Ä≠  To shut my lips, or close my broken eyes.
‚Ä≠  Nothing so heap‚Äôd is with impieties,
‚Ä≠  As such a woman that would kill her spouse
‚Ä≠  That married her a maid.  When to my house
‚Ä≠  I brought her, hoping of her love in heart,
‚Ä≠  To children, maids, and slaves.  But she (in th‚Äô art
‚Ä≠  Of only mischief hearty) not alone
‚Ä≠  Cast on herself this foul aspersi√≥n,
‚Ä≠  But loving dames, hereafter, to their lords
‚Ä≠  Will bear, for good deeds, her bad thoughts and words.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄòAlas,‚Äô  said I,  ‚Äòthat Jove should hate the lives
‚Ä≠  Of Atreus‚Äô seed so highly for their wives!
‚Ä≠  For Menelaus‚Äô wife a number fell,
‚Ä≠  For dang‚Äôrous absence thine sent thee to hell.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄòFor this,‚Äô  he answer‚Äôd,  ‚Äòbe not thou more kind
‚Ä≠  Than wise to thy wife.  Never all thy mind
‚Ä≠  Let words express to her.  Of all she knows,
‚Ä≠  Curbs for the worst still, in thyself repose.
‚Ä≠  But thou by thy wife‚Äôs wiles shalt lose no blood,
‚Ä≠  Exceeding wise she is, and wise in good.
‚Ä≠  Icarius‚Äô daughter, chaste Penelope,
‚Ä≠  We left a young bride, when for battle we
‚Ä≠  Forsook the nuptial peace, and at her breast
‚Ä≠  Her first child sucking, who, by this hour, blest,
‚Ä≠  Sits in the number of surviving men.
‚Ä≠  And his bliss she hath, that she can contain,
‚Ä≠  And her bliss thou hast, that she is so wise.
‚Ä≠  For, by her wisdom, thy return√©d eyes
‚Ä≠  Shall see thy son, and he shall greet his sire
‚Ä≠  With fitting welcomes; when in my retire,
‚Ä≠  My wife denies mine eyes my son‚Äôs dear sight,
‚Ä≠  And, as from me, will take from him the light,
‚Ä≠  Before she adds one just delight to life,
‚Ä≠  Or her false wit one truth that fits a wife.
‚Ä≠  For her sake therefore let my harms advise,
‚Ä≠  That though thy wife be ne‚Äôer so chaste and wise,
‚Ä≠  Yet come not home to her in open view,  [7]
‚Ä≠  With any ship or any personal show,
‚Ä≠  But take close shore disguis‚Äôd, nor let her know,
‚Ä≠  For ‚Äôtis no world to trust a woman now.
‚Ä≠  But what says Fame?  Doth my son yet survive,
‚Ä≠  In Orchomen, or Pylos?  Or doth live
‚Ä≠  In Sparta with his uncle?  Yet I see
‚Ä≠  Divine Orestes is not here with me.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     I answer‚Äôd, asking:  ‚ÄòWhy doth Atreus‚Äô son
‚Ä≠  Enquire of me, who yet arriv‚Äôd where none
‚Ä≠  Could give to these news any certain wings?
‚Ä≠  And ‚Äôtis absurd to tell uncertain things.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     Such sad speech past us; and as thus we stood,
‚Ä≠  With kind tears rend‚Äôring unkind fortunes good,
‚Ä≠  Achilles‚Äô and Patroclus‚Äô soul appear‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And his soul, of whom never ill was heard,
‚Ä≠  The good Antilochus, and the soul of him
‚Ä≠  That all the Greeks past both for force and limb,
‚Ä≠  Excepting the unmatch‚Äôd √Üacides,
‚Ä≠  Illustrious Ajax.  But the first of these
‚Ä≠  That saw, acknowledg‚Äôd, and saluted me,
‚Ä≠  Was Thetis‚Äô conqu‚Äôring son, who (heavily
‚Ä≠  His state here taking) said:  ‚ÄòUnworthy breath!
‚Ä≠  What act yet mightier imagineth
‚Ä≠  Thy vent‚Äôrous spirit?  How dost thou descend
‚Ä≠  These under-regions, where the dead man‚Äôs end
‚Ä≠  Is to be look‚Äôd on, and his foolish shade?‚Äô
‚Ä≠     I answer‚Äôd him:  ‚ÄòI was induc‚Äôd t‚Äô invade
‚Ä≠  These under-parts, most excellent of Greece,
‚Ä≠  To visit wise Tiresias, for advice
‚Ä≠  Of virtue to direct my voyage home
‚Ä≠  To rugged Ithaca; since I could come
‚Ä≠  To note in no place, where Achaia stood,
‚Ä≠  And so liv‚Äôd ever, tortur‚Äôd with the blood
‚Ä≠  In man‚Äôs vain veins.  Thou, therefore, Thetis‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  Hast equall‚Äôd all, that ever yet have won
‚Ä≠  The bliss the earth yields, or hereafter shall.
‚Ä≠  In life thy eminence was ador‚Äôd of all,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn with the Gods; and now, ev‚Äôn dead, I see
‚Ä≠  Thy virtues propagate thy empery
‚Ä≠  To a renew‚Äôd life of command beneath;
‚Ä≠  So great Achilles triumphs over death.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  This comfort of him this encounter found;
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòUrge not my death to me, nor rub that wound,
‚Ä≠  I rather wish to live in earth a swain,
‚Ä≠  Or serve a swain for hire, that scarce can gain
‚Ä≠  Bread to sustain him, than, that life once gone,
‚Ä≠  Of all the dead sway the imperial throne.
‚Ä≠  But say, and of my son some comfort yield,
‚Ä≠  If he goes on in first fights of the field,
‚Ä≠  Or lurks for safety in the obscure rear?
‚Ä≠  Or of my father if thy royal ear
‚Ä≠  Hath been advertis‚Äôd, that the Phthian throne
‚Ä≠  He still commands, as greatest Myrmidon?
‚Ä≠  Or that the Phthian and Thessalian rage
‚Ä≠  (Now feet and hands are in the hold of age)
‚Ä≠  Despise his empire?  Under those bright rays,
‚Ä≠  In which heav‚Äôn‚Äôs fervour hurls about the days.
‚Ä≠  Must I no more shine his revenger now,
‚Ä≠  Such as of old the Ilion overthrow
‚Ä≠  Witness‚Äôd my anger, th‚Äô universal host
‚Ä≠  Sending before me to this shady coast,
‚Ä≠  In fight for Grecia.  Could I now resort,
‚Ä≠  (But for some small time) to my father‚Äôs court,
‚Ä≠  In spirit and pow‚Äôr as then, those men should find
‚Ä≠  My hands inaccessible, and of fire my mind,
‚Ä≠  That durst with all the numbers they are strong
‚Ä≠  Unseat his honour, and suborn his wrong.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This pitch still flew his spirit, though so low,
‚Ä≠  And this I answer‚Äôd thus:  ‚ÄòI do not know
‚Ä≠  Of blameless Peleus any least report,
‚Ä≠  But of your son, in all the utmost sort,
‚Ä≠  I can inform your care with truth, and thus:
‚Ä≠     From Scyros princely Neoptolemus
‚Ä≠  By fleet I convey‚Äôd to the Greeks, where he
‚Ä≠  Was chief, at both parts, when our gravity
‚Ä≠  Retir‚Äôd to council, and our youth to fight.
‚Ä≠  In council still so fiery was Conceit
‚Ä≠  In his quick apprehension of a cause,
‚Ä≠  That first he ever spake, nor pass‚Äôd the laws
‚Ä≠  Of any great stay, in his greatest haste.
‚Ä≠  None would contend with him, that counsell‚Äôd last,
‚Ä≠  Unless illustrious Nestor, he and I
‚Ä≠  Would sometimes put a friendly contrary
‚Ä≠  On his opinion.  In our fights, the prease
‚Ä≠  Of great or common, he would never cease,
‚Ä≠  But far before fight ever.  No man there,
‚Ä≠  For force, he forc√©d.  He was slaughterer
‚Ä≠  Of many a brave man in most dreadful fight.
‚Ä≠  But one and other whom he reft of light,
‚Ä≠  In Grecian succour, I can neither name,
‚Ä≠  Nor give in number.  The particular fame
‚Ä≠  Of one man‚Äôs slaughter yet I must not pass;
‚Ä≠  Eurypylus Telephides he was,
‚Ä≠  That fell beneath him, and with him the falls
‚Ä≠  Of such huge men went, that they show‚Äôd like whales  [8]
‚Ä≠  Rampir‚Äôd about him.  Neoptolemus
‚Ä≠  Set him so sharply, for the sumptuous
‚Ä≠  Favours of mistresses he saw him wear;
‚Ä≠  For past all doubt his beauties had no peer
‚Ä≠  Of all that mine eyes noted, next to one,
‚Ä≠  And that was Memnon, Tithon‚Äôs Sun-like son.
‚Ä≠  Thus far, for fight in public, may a taste
‚Ä≠  Give of his eminence.  How far surpast
‚Ä≠  His spirit in private, where he was not seen,
‚Ä≠  Nor glory could be said to praise his spleen,
‚Ä≠  This close note I excerpted.  When we sat
‚Ä≠  Hid in Ep√´us‚Äô horse, no optimate
‚Ä≠  Of all the Greeks there had the charge to ope
‚Ä≠  And shut the stratagem but I.  [9]  My scope
‚Ä≠  To note then each man‚Äôs spirit in a strait
‚Ä≠  Of so much danger, much the better might
‚Ä≠  Be hit by me, than others, as, provok‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  I shifted place still, when, in some I smok‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Both privy tremblings, and close vent of tears,
‚Ä≠  In him yet not a soft conceit of theirs
‚Ä≠  Could all my search see, either his wet eyes
‚Ä≠  Ply‚Äôd still with wipings, or the goodly guise,
‚Ä≠  His person all ways put forth, in least part,
‚Ä≠  By any tremblings, show‚Äôd his touch‚Äôd-at heart.
‚Ä≠  But ever he was urging me to make
‚Ä≠  Way to their sally, by his sign to shake
‚Ä≠  His sword hid in his scabbard, or his lance
‚Ä≠  Loaded with iron, at me.  No good chance
‚Ä≠  His thoughts to Troy intended.  In th‚Äô event,
‚Ä≠  High Troy depopulate, he made ascent
‚Ä≠  To his fair ship, with prise and treasure store,
‚Ä≠  Safe, and no touch away with him he bore
‚Ä≠  Of far-off-hurl‚Äôd lance, or of close-fought sword,
‚Ä≠  Whose wounds for favours war doth oft afford,
‚Ä≠  Which he (though sought) miss‚Äôd in war‚Äôs closest wage.
‚Ä≠  _In close fights Mars doth never fight, but rage.‚Äô_
‚Ä≠     This made the soul of swift Achilles tread
‚Ä≠  A march of glory through the herby mead,
‚Ä≠  For joy to hear me so renown his son;
‚Ä≠  And vanish‚Äôd stalking.  But with passi√≥n
‚Ä≠  Stood th‚Äô other souls struck, and each told his bane.
‚Ä≠  Only the spirit Telamonian  [10]
‚Ä≠  Kept far off, angry for the victory
‚Ä≠  I won from him at fleet; though arbitry
‚Ä≠  Of all a court of war pronounc‚Äôd it mine,
‚Ä≠  And Pallas‚Äô self.  Our prise were th‚Äô arms divine
‚Ä≠  Of great √Üacides, proposd t‚Äô our fames
‚Ä≠  By his bright Mother, at his funeral games.
‚Ä≠  I wish to heav‚Äôn I ought not to have won;
‚Ä≠  Since for those arms so high a head so soon
‚Ä≠  The base earth cover‚Äôd, Ajax, that of all
‚Ä≠  The host of Greece had person capital,
‚Ä≠  And acts as eminent, excepting his
‚Ä≠  Whose arms those were, in whom was nought amiss.
‚Ä≠  I tried the great soul with soft words, and said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòAjax!  Great son of Telamon, array‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In all our glories!  What!  not dead resign
‚Ä≠  Thy wrath for those curst arms?  The Pow‚Äôrs divine
‚Ä≠  In them forg‚Äôd all our banes, in thine own one,
‚Ä≠  In thy grave fall our tower was overthrown.
‚Ä≠  We mourn, for ever maim‚Äôd, for thee as much
‚Ä≠  As for Achilles; nor thy wrong doth touch,
‚Ä≠  In sentence, any but Saturnius‚Äô doom;
‚Ä≠  In whose hate was the host of Greece become
‚Ä≠  A very horror; who express‚Äôd it well
‚Ä≠  In signing thy fate with this timeless hell.
‚Ä≠  Approach then, king of all the Grecian merit,
‚Ä≠  Repress thy great mind and thy flamy spirit,
‚Ä≠  And give the words I give thee worthy ear.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     All this no word drew from him, but less near
‚Ä≠  The stern soul kept; to other souls he fled,
‚Ä≠  And glid along the river of the dead.
‚Ä≠  Though anger mov‚Äôd him, yet he might have spoke,
‚Ä≠  Since I to him.  But my desires were strook
‚Ä≠  With sight of other souls.  And then I saw
‚Ä≠  Minos, that minister‚Äôd to Death a law,
‚Ä≠  And Jove‚Äôs bright son was.  He was set, and sway‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A golden sceptre; and to him did plead
‚Ä≠  A sort of others, set about his throne,
‚Ä≠  In Pluto‚Äôs wide-door‚Äôd house; when straight came on
‚Ä≠  Mighty Orion, who was hunting there
‚Ä≠  The herds of those beasts he had slaughter‚Äôd here
‚Ä≠  In desert hills on earth.  A club he bore,
‚Ä≠  Entirely steel, whose virtues never wore.
‚Ä≠     Tityus I saw, to whom the glorious earth
‚Ä≠  Open‚Äôd her womb, and gave unhappy birth.
‚Ä≠  Upwards, and flat upon the pavement, lay
‚Ä≠  His ample limbs, that spread in their display
‚Ä≠  Nine acres‚Äô compass.  On his bosom sat
‚Ä≠  Two vultures, digging, through his caul of fat,
‚Ä≠  Into his liver with their crook√©d beaks;
‚Ä≠  And each by turns the concrete entrail breaks
‚Ä≠  (As smiths their steel beat) set on either side.
‚Ä≠  Nor doth he ever labour to divide
‚Ä≠  His liver and their beaks, nor with his hand
‚Ä≠  Offer them off, but suffers by command
‚Ä≠  Of th‚Äô angry Thund‚Äôrer, off‚Äôring to enforce
‚Ä≠  His love Latona, in the close recourse
‚Ä≠  She us‚Äôd to Pytho through the dancing land,
‚Ä≠  Smooth Panop√´us, I saw likewise stand,
‚Ä≠  Up to the chin, amidst a liquid lake,
‚Ä≠  Tormented Tantalus, yet could not slake
‚Ä≠  His burning thirst.  Oft as his scornful cup
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô old man would taste, so oft ‚Äôtwas swallow‚Äôd up,
‚Ä≠  And all the black earth to his feet descried,
‚Ä≠  Divine pow‚Äôr (plaguing him) the lake still dried.
‚Ä≠  About his head, on high trees, clust‚Äôring, hung
‚Ä≠  Pears, apples, granates, olives ever-young,
‚Ä≠  Delicious figs, and many fruit-trees more
‚Ä≠  Of other burden; whose alluring store
‚Ä≠  When th‚Äô old soul striv‚Äôd to pluck, the winds from sight,
‚Ä≠  In gloomy vapours, made them vanish quite.
‚Ä≠     There saw I Sisyphus in infinite moan,
‚Ä≠  With both hands heaving up a massy stone,
‚Ä≠  And on his tip-toes racking all his height,
‚Ä≠  To wrest up to a mountain-top his freight;
‚Ä≠  When prest to rest it there, his nerves quite spent,
‚Ä≠  Down rush‚Äôd the deadly quarry, the event
‚Ä≠  Of all his torture new to raise again;
‚Ä≠  To which straight set his never-rested pain.
‚Ä≠  The sweat came gushing out from ev‚Äôry pore
‚Ä≠  And on his head a standing mist he wore,
‚Ä≠  Reeking from thence, as if a cloud of dust
‚Ä≠  Were rais‚Äôd about it.  Down with these was thrust
‚Ä≠  The idol of the force of Hercules,
‚Ä≠  But his firm self did no such fate oppress,
‚Ä≠  He feasting lives amongst th‚Äô Immortal States,
‚Ä≠  White-ankled Hebe and himself made mates
‚Ä≠  In heav‚Äônly nuptials.  Hebe, Jove‚Äôs dear race,
‚Ä≠  And Juno‚Äôs whom the golden sandals grace.
‚Ä≠  About him flew the clamours of the dead
‚Ä≠  Like fowls, and still stoop‚Äôd cuffing at his head.
‚Ä≠  He with his bow, like Night, stalk‚Äôd up and down,
‚Ä≠  His shaft still nock‚Äôd, and hurling round his frown
‚Ä≠  At those vex‚Äôd hov‚Äôrers, aiming at them still,
‚Ä≠  And still, as shooting out, desire to still.
‚Ä≠  A horrid bawdrick wore he thwart his breast,
‚Ä≠  The thong all-gold, in which were forms imprest,
‚Ä≠  Where art and miracle drew equal breaths,
‚Ä≠  In bears, boars, lions, battles, combats, deaths,
‚Ä≠  Who wrought that work did never such before,
‚Ä≠  Nor so divinely will do ever more.
‚Ä≠  Soon as he saw, he knew me, and gave speech:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòSon of Laertes, high in wisdom‚Äôs reach,
‚Ä≠  And yet unhappy wretch, for in this heart,
‚Ä≠  Of all exploits achiev‚Äôd by thy desert,
‚Ä≠  Thy worth but works out some sinister fate,
‚Ä≠  As I in earth did.  I was generate
‚Ä≠  By Jove himself, and yet past mean opprest
‚Ä≠  By one my far inferior, whose proud hest
‚Ä≠  Impos‚Äôd abhorr√©d labours on my hand.
‚Ä≠  Of all which one was, to descend this strand,
‚Ä≠  And hale the dog from thence.  He could not think
‚Ä≠  An act that danger could make deeper sink.
‚Ä≠  And yet this depth I drew, and fetch‚Äôd as high,
‚Ä≠  As this was low, the dog.  The Deity
‚Ä≠  Of sleight and wisdom, as of downright pow‚Äôr,
‚Ä≠  Both stoop‚Äôd, and rais‚Äôd, and made me conqueror.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This said, he made descent again as low
‚Ä≠  As Pluto‚Äôs court; when I stood firm, for show
‚Ä≠  Of more hero√´s of the times before,
‚Ä≠  And might perhaps have seen my wish of more,
‚Ä≠  (As Theseus and Pirithous, deriv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  From roots of Deity) but before th‚Äô achiev‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Rare sight of these, the rank-soul‚Äôd multitude
‚Ä≠  In infinite flocks rose, venting sounds so rude,
‚Ä≠  That pale Fear took me, lest the Gorgon‚Äôs head
‚Ä≠  Rush‚Äôd in amongst them, thrust up, in my dread,
‚Ä≠  By grim Persephon√©.  I therefore sent
‚Ä≠  My men before to ship, and after went.
‚Ä≠  Where, boarded, set, and launch‚Äôd, the ocean wave
‚Ä≠  Our oars and forewinds speedy passage gave.

‚Ä≠  THE TWELFTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  He shows from Hell his safe retreat
‚Ä≠  To th‚Äô isle √Ü√¶a, Circe‚Äôs seat;
‚Ä≠  And how he ‚Äôscap‚Äôd the Sirens‚Äô calls,
‚Ä≠  With th‚Äô erring rocks, and waters‚Äô falls,
‚Ä≠  That Scylla and Charybdis break;
‚Ä≠  The Sun‚Äô s stol‚Äô n herds; and his sad wreak
‚Ä≠  Both of Ulysses‚Äô ship and men,
‚Ä≠  His own head ‚Äôscaping scarce the pain.
‚Ä≠
‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _ŒúœÖÃë_
‚Ä≠     The rocks that err‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠        The Sirens‚Äô call.
‚Ä≠     The Sun‚Äôs stol‚Äôn herd.
‚Ä≠        The soldiers‚Äô fall.

‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúOur ship now past the straits of th‚Äô ocean flood,
‚Ä≠  She plow‚Äôd the broad sea‚Äôs billows, and made good
‚Ä≠  The isle √Ü√¶a, where the palace stands
‚Ä≠  Of th‚Äô early riser with the rosy hands,
‚Ä≠  Active Aurora, where she loves to dance,
‚Ä≠  And where the Sun doth his prime beams advance.
‚Ä≠     When here arriv‚Äôd, we drew her up to land,
‚Ä≠  And trod ourselves the re-saluted sand,
‚Ä≠  Found on the shore fit resting for the night,
‚Ä≠  Slept, and expected the celestial light.
‚Ä≠     Soon as the white-and-red-mix‚Äôd finger‚Äôd Dame
‚Ä≠  Had gilt the mountains with her saffron flame,
‚Ä≠  I sent my men to Circe‚Äôs house before,
‚Ä≠  To fetch deceas‚Äôd Elpenor to the shore.
‚Ä≠     Straight swell‚Äôd the high banks with fell'd heaps of trees,
‚Ä≠  And, full of tears, we did due exsequies
‚Ä≠  To our dead friend.  Whose corse consum‚Äôd with fire,
‚Ä≠  And honour‚Äôd arms, whose sepulchre entire,
‚Ä≠  And over that a column rais‚Äôd, his oar,
‚Ä≠  Curiously carv‚Äôd, to his desire before,
‚Ä≠  Upon the top of all his tomb we fix‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Of all rites fit his funeral pile was mix‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     Nor was our safe ascent from Hell conceal‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  From Circe‚Äôs knowledge; nor so soon reveal‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  But she was with us, with her bread and food,
‚Ä≠  And ruddy wine, brought by her sacred brood
‚Ä≠  Of woods and fountains.  In the midst she stood,
‚Ä≠  And thus saluted us;  ‚ÄòUnhappy men,
‚Ä≠  That have, inform‚Äôd with all your senses, been
‚Ä≠  In Pluto‚Äôs dismal mansion!  You shall die
‚Ä≠  Twice now, where others, that Mortality
‚Ä≠  In her fair arms holds, shall but once decease.
‚Ä≠  But eat and drink out all conceit of these,
‚Ä≠  And this day dedicate to food and wine,
‚Ä≠  The following night to sleep.  When next shall shine
‚Ä≠  The cheerful morning, you shall prove the seas.
‚Ä≠  Your way, and ev‚Äôry act ye must address,
‚Ä≠  My knowledge of their order shall design,
‚Ä≠  Lest with your own bad counsels ye incline
‚Ä≠  Events as bad against ye, and sustain,
‚Ä≠  By sea and shore, the woful ends that reign
‚Ä≠  In wilful actions.‚Äô  Thus did she advise
‚Ä≠  And, for the time, our fortunes were so wise
‚Ä≠  To follow wise directions.  All that day
‚Ä≠  We sat and feasted.  When his lower way
‚Ä≠  The Sun had entered, and the Even the high,
‚Ä≠  My friends slept on their gables; she and I
‚Ä≠  (Led by her fair hand to place apart,
‚Ä≠  By her well-sorted) did to sleep convert
‚Ä≠  Our timid pow‚Äôrs; when all things Fate let fall
‚Ä≠  In our affair she ask‚Äôd; I told her all.
‚Ä≠  To which she answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄòThese things thus took end.
‚Ä≠  And now to those that I inform attend,
‚Ä≠  Which you rememb‚Äôring, God himself shall be
‚Ä≠  The bless√©d author of your memory.
‚Ä≠     First to the Sirens ye shall come, that taint
‚Ä≠  The minds of all men whom they can acquaint
‚Ä≠  With their attractions.  Whosoever shall,
‚Ä≠  For want of knowledge mov‚Äôd, but hear the call
‚Ä≠  Of any Siren, he will so despise
‚Ä≠  Both wife and children, for their sorceries,
‚Ä≠  That never home turns his affection‚Äôs stream,
‚Ä≠  Nor they take joy in him, nor he in them.
‚Ä≠  The Sirens will so soften with their song
‚Ä≠  (Shrill, and in sensual appetite so strong)
‚Ä≠  His loose affections, that he gives them head.
‚Ä≠  And then observe:  They sit amidst a mead,
‚Ä≠  And round about it runs a hedge or wall
‚Ä≠  Of dead men‚Äôs bones, their wither‚Äôd skins and all
‚Ä≠  Hung all along upon it; and these men
‚Ä≠  Were such as they had fawn‚Äôd into their fen,
‚Ä≠  And then their skins hung on their hedge of bones.
‚Ä≠  Sail by them therefore, thy companions
‚Ä≠  Beforehand causing to stop ev‚Äôry ear
‚Ä≠  With sweet soft wax, so close that none may hear
‚Ä≠  A note of all their charmings.  Yet may you,
‚Ä≠  If you affect it, open ear allow
‚Ä≠  To try their motion; but presume not so
‚Ä≠  To trust your judgment, when your senses go
‚Ä≠  So loose about you, but give strait command
‚Ä≠  To all your men, to bind you foot and hand
‚Ä≠  Sure to the mast, that you may safe approve
‚Ä≠  How strong in instigation to their love
‚Ä≠  Their rapting tunes are.  If so much they move,
‚Ä≠  That, spite of all your reason, your will stands
‚Ä≠  To be enfranchis‚Äôd both of feet and hands,
‚Ä≠  Charge all your men before to slight your charge,
‚Ä≠  And rest so far from fearing to enlarge
‚Ä≠  That much more sure they bind you.  When your friends
‚Ä≠  Have outsail‚Äôd these, the danger that transcends
‚Ä≠  Rests not in any counsel to prevent,
‚Ä≠  Unless your own mind finds the tract and bent
‚Ä≠  Of that way that avoids it.  I can say
‚Ä≠  That in your course there lies a twofold way,
‚Ä≠  The right of which your own, taught, present wit,
‚Ä≠  And grace divine, must prompt.  In gen‚Äôral yet
‚Ä≠  Let this inform you:  Near these Sirens‚Äô shore
‚Ä≠  Move two steep rocks, at whose feet lie and roar
‚Ä≠  The black sea‚Äôs cruel billows; the bless‚Äôd Gods
‚Ä≠  Call them the Rovers.  Their abhorr‚Äôd abodes
‚Ä≠  No bird can pass; no not the doves, whose fear  [1]
‚Ä≠  Sire Jove so loves that they are said to bear
‚Ä≠  Ambrosia to him, can their ravine ‚Äôscape,
‚Ä≠  But one of them falls ever to the rape
‚Ä≠  Of those sly rocks; yet Jove another still
‚Ä≠  Adds to the rest, that so may ever fill
‚Ä≠  The sacred number.  Never ship could shun
‚Ä≠  The nimble peril wing‚Äôd there, but did run
‚Ä≠  With all her bulk, and bodies of her men,
‚Ä≠  To utter ruin.  For the seas retain
‚Ä≠  Not only their outrageous √¶sture there,
‚Ä≠  But fierce assistants of particular fear,
‚Ä≠  And supernatural mischief, they exspire,
‚Ä≠  And those are whirlwinds of devouring fire
‚Ä≠  Whisking about still.  Th‚Äô Argive ship alone,
‚Ä≠  Which bore the care of all men, got her gone,  [2]
‚Ä≠  Come from Areta.  Yet perhaps ev‚Äôn she
‚Ä≠  Had wrack‚Äôd at those rocks, if the Deity,
‚Ä≠  That lies by Jove‚Äôs side, had not lent her hand
‚Ä≠  To their transmission; since the man, that mann‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In chief that voyage, she in chief did love.
‚Ä≠  Of these two spiteful rocks, the one doth shove
‚Ä≠  Against the height of heav‚Äôn her pointed brow.
‚Ä≠  A black cloud binds it round, and never show
‚Ä≠  Lends to the sharp point; not the clear blue sky
‚Ä≠  Lets ever view it, not the summer‚Äôs eye,
‚Ä≠  Nor fervent autumn‚Äôs.  None that death could end
‚Ä≠  Could ever scale it, or, if up, descend,
‚Ä≠  Though twenty hands and feet he had for hold,
‚Ä≠  A polish‚Äôd ice-like glibness doth enfold
‚Ä≠  The rock so round, whose midst a gloomy cell
‚Ä≠  Shrouds so far westward that it sees to hell.
‚Ä≠  From this keep you as far, as from his bow
‚Ä≠  An able young man can his shaft bestow.
‚Ä≠  For here the whuling Scylla shrouds her face,  [3]
‚Ä≠  That breathes a voice at all parts no more base
‚Ä≠  Than are a newly-kitten‚Äôd kitling‚Äôs cries,
‚Ä≠  Herself a monster yet of boundless size,
‚Ä≠  Whose sight would nothing please a mortal‚Äôs eyes,
‚Ä≠  No nor the eyes of any God, if he
‚Ä≠  (Whom nought should fright) fell foul on her, and she
‚Ä≠  Her full shape show‚Äôd.  Twelve foul feet bear about
‚Ä≠  Her ugly bulk.  Six huge long necks look out
‚Ä≠  Of her rank shoulders; ev‚Äôry neck doth let
‚Ä≠  A ghastly head out; ev‚Äôry head three set,
‚Ä≠  Thick thrust together, of abhorr√©d teeth,
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôry tooth stuck with a sable death.
‚Ä≠     She lurks in midst of all her den, and streaks
‚Ä≠  From out a ghastly whirlpool all her necks;
‚Ä≠  Where, gloting round her rock, to fish she falls;
‚Ä≠  And up rush dolphins, dogfish; somewhiles whales
‚Ä≠  If got within her when her rapine feeds;
‚Ä≠  For ever-groaning Amphitrite breeds
‚Ä≠  About her whirlpool an unmeasur‚Äôd store.
‚Ä≠  No sea-man ever boasted touch of shore
‚Ä≠  That there touch‚Äôd with his ship, but still she fed
‚Ä≠  Of him and his; a man for ev‚Äôry head
‚Ä≠  Spoiling his ship of.  You shall then descry
‚Ä≠  The other humbler rock, that moves so nigh
‚Ä≠  Your dart may mete the distance.  It receives
‚Ä≠  A huge wild fig-tree, curl‚Äôd with ample leaves,
‚Ä≠  Beneath whose shades divine Charybdis sits,
‚Ä≠  Supping the black deeps.  Thrice a day her pits
‚Ä≠  She drinking all dry, and thrice a day again
‚Ä≠  All up she belches, baneful to sustain.
‚Ä≠  When she is drinking, dare not near her draught,
‚Ä≠  For not the force of Neptune, if once caught,
‚Ä≠  Can force your freedom.  Therefore, in your strife
‚Ä≠  To ‚Äôscape Charybdis, labour all for life
‚Ä≠  To row near Scylla, for she will but have
‚Ä≠  For her six heads six men; and better save
‚Ä≠  The rest, than all make off‚Äôrings to the wave.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This need she told me of my loss, when I
‚Ä≠  Desir‚Äôd to know, if that Necessity,
‚Ä≠  When I had ‚Äôscap‚Äôd Charybdis‚Äô outrages,
‚Ä≠  My pow‚Äôrs might not revenge, though not redress?
‚Ä≠  She answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄòO unhappy!  art thou yet
‚Ä≠  Enflam‚Äôd with war, and thirst to drink thy sweat?
‚Ä≠  Not to the Gods give up both arms and will?
‚Ä≠  She deathless is, and that immortal ill
‚Ä≠  Grave, harsh, outrageous, not to be subdued,
‚Ä≠  That men must suffer till they be renew‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Nor lives there any virtue that can fly
‚Ä≠  The vicious outrage of their cruelty.
‚Ä≠  Shouldst thou put arms on, and approach the rock,
‚Ä≠  I fear six more must expiate the shock.
‚Ä≠  Six heads six men ask still.  Hoise sail, and fly,
‚Ä≠  And, in thy flight, aloud on Cratis cry
‚Ä≠  (Great Scylla‚Äôs mother, who expos‚Äôd to light
‚Ä≠  The bane of men) and she will do such right
‚Ä≠  To thy observance, that she down will tread
‚Ä≠  Her daughter‚Äôs rage, nor let her show a head.
‚Ä≠     From thenceforth then, for ever past her care,
‚Ä≠  Thou shalt ascend the isle triangular,
‚Ä≠  Where many oxen of the Sun are fed,
‚Ä≠  And fatted flocks.  Of oxen fifty head
‚Ä≠  In ev‚Äôry herd feed, and their herds are seven;
‚Ä≠  And of his fat flocks is their number even.
‚Ä≠  Increase they yield not, for they never die.
‚Ä≠  There ev‚Äôry shepherdess a Deity.
‚Ä≠  Fair Pha√´thusa, and Lampeti√©,
‚Ä≠  The lovely Nymphs are that their guardians be,
‚Ä≠  Who to the daylight‚Äôs lofty-going Flame
‚Ä≠  Had gracious birthright from the heav‚Äônly Dame,
‚Ä≠  Still young Ne√¶ra; who (brought forth and bred)
‚Ä≠  Far off dismiss‚Äôd them, to see duly fed
‚Ä≠  Their father‚Äôs herds and flocks in Sicily.
‚Ä≠  These herds and flocks if to the Deity
‚Ä≠  Ye leave, as sacred things, untouch‚Äôd, and on
‚Ä≠  Go with all fit care of your home, alone,
‚Ä≠  (Though through some suff‚Äôrance) you yet safe shall land
‚Ä≠  In wish√©d Ithaca.  But if impious hand
‚Ä≠  You lay on those herds to their hurts, I then
‚Ä≠  Presage sure ruin to thy ship and men.
‚Ä≠  If thou escap‚Äôst thyself, extending home
‚Ä≠  Thy long‚Äôd-for landing, thou shalt loaded come
‚Ä≠  With store of losses, most exceeding late,
‚Ä≠  And not consorted with a sav√©d mate.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This said, the golden-thron‚Äôd Aurora rose,
‚Ä≠  She her way went, and I did mine dispose
‚Ä≠  Up to my ship, weigh‚Äôd anchor, and away.
‚Ä≠  When rev‚Äôrend Circe help‚Äôd us to convey
‚Ä≠  Our vessel safe, by making well inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A seaman‚Äôs true companion, a forewind,
‚Ä≠  With which she fill‚Äôd our sails; when, fitting all
‚Ä≠  Our arms close by us, I did sadly fall
‚Ä≠  To grave relation what concern‚Äôd in fate
‚Ä≠  My friends to know, and told them that the state
‚Ä≠  Of our affairs‚Äô success, which Circe had
‚Ä≠  Presag‚Äôd to me alone, must yet be made
‚Ä≠  To one nor only two known, but to all;
‚Ä≠  That, since their lives and deaths were left to fall
‚Ä≠  In their elections, they might life elect,
‚Ä≠  And give what would preserve it fit effect.
‚Ä≠     I first inform‚Äôd them, that we were to fly
‚Ä≠  The heav‚Äônly-singing Sirens‚Äô harmony,
‚Ä≠  And flow‚Äôr-adorned meadow; and that I
‚Ä≠  Had charge to hear their song, but fetter‚Äôd fast
‚Ä≠  In bands, unfavour‚Äôd, to th‚Äô erected mast,
‚Ä≠  From whence, if I should pray, or use command,
‚Ä≠  To be enlarg‚Äôd, they should with much more band
‚Ä≠  Contain my strugglings.  This I simply told
‚Ä≠  To each particular, nor would withhold
‚Ä≠  What most enjoin‚Äôd mine own affection‚Äôs stay,
‚Ä≠  That theirs the rather might be taught t‚Äô obey.
‚Ä≠     In mean time flew our ships, and straight we fetch‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The Siren‚Äôs isle; a spleenless wind so stretch‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Her wings to waft us, and so urg‚Äôd our keel.
‚Ä≠  But having reach‚Äôd this isle, we could not feel
‚Ä≠  The least gasp of it, it was stricken dead,
‚Ä≠  And all the sea in prostrate slumber spread,
‚Ä≠  The Sirens‚Äô devil charm‚Äôd all.  Up then flew
‚Ä≠  My friends to work, struck sail, together drew,
‚Ä≠  And under hatches stow‚Äôd them, sat, and plied
‚Ä≠  The polish‚Äôd oars, and did in curls divide
‚Ä≠  The white-head waters.  My part then came on:
‚Ä≠  A mighty waxen cake I set upon,
‚Ä≠  Chopp‚Äôd it in fragments with my sword, and wrought
‚Ä≠  With strong hand ev‚Äôry piece, till all were soft.
‚Ä≠  The great pow‚Äôr of the sun, in such a beam
‚Ä≠  As then flew burning from his diadem,
‚Ä≠  To liquefaction help‚Äôd us.  Orderly
‚Ä≠  I stopp‚Äôd their ears; and they as fair did ply
‚Ä≠  My feet and hands with cords, and to the mast
‚Ä≠  With other halsers made me soundly fast.
‚Ä≠     Then took they seat, and forth our passage strook,
‚Ä≠  The foamy sea beneath their labour shook.
‚Ä≠     Row‚Äôd on, in reach of an erected voice,
‚Ä≠  The Sirens soon took note, without our noise,
‚Ä≠  Tun‚Äôd those sweet accents that made charms so strong,
‚Ä≠  And these learn‚Äôd numbers made the Sirens‚Äô song:
‚Ä≠     _‚ÄòCome here, thou worthy of a world of praise,
‚Ä≠  That dost so high the Grecian glory raise,
‚Ä≠  Ulysses!  stay thy ship, and that song hear
‚Ä≠  That none pass‚Äôd ever but it bent his ear,
‚Ä≠  But left him ravish‚Äôd, and instructed more
‚Ä≠  By us, than any ever heard before.
‚Ä≠  For we know all things whatsoever were
‚Ä≠  In wide Troy labour‚Äôd; whatsoever there
‚Ä≠  The Grecians and the Trojans both sustain‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By those high issues that the Gods ordain‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  And whatsoever all the earth can show
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô inform a knowledge of desert, we know.‚Äô_
‚Ä≠     This they gave accent in the sweetest strain
‚Ä≠  That ever open‚Äôd an enamour‚Äôd vein.
‚Ä≠  When my constrain‚Äôd heart needs would have mine ear
‚Ä≠  Yet more delighted, force way forth, and hear.
‚Ä≠  To which end I commanded with all sign
‚Ä≠  Stern looks could make (for not a joint of mine
‚Ä≠  Had pow‚Äôr to stir) my friends to rise, and give
‚Ä≠  My limbs free way.  They freely striv‚Äôd to drive
‚Ä≠  Their ship still on.  When, far from will to loose,
‚Ä≠  Eurylochus and Perimedes rose
‚Ä≠  To wrap me surer, and oppress‚Äôd me more
‚Ä≠  With many a halser than had use before.
‚Ä≠  When, rowing on without the reach of sound,
‚Ä≠  My friends unstopp‚Äôd their ears, and me unbound,
‚Ä≠  And that isle quite we quitted.  But again
‚Ä≠  Fresh fears employ‚Äôd us.  I beheld a main
‚Ä≠  Of mighty billows, and a smoke ascend,
‚Ä≠  A horrid murmur hearing.  Ev‚Äôry friend
‚Ä≠  Astonish‚Äôd sat; from ev‚Äôry hand his Oar
‚Ä≠  Fell quite forsaken; with the dismal roar
‚Ä≠  Were all things there made echoes; stone-still stood
‚Ä≠  Our ship itself, because the ghastly flood
‚Ä≠  Took all men‚Äôs motions from her in their own.
‚Ä≠  I through the ship went, labouring up and down
‚Ä≠  My friends‚Äô recover‚Äôd spirits.  One by one
‚Ä≠  I gave good words, and said:  That well were known
‚Ä≠  These ills to them before, I told them all,
‚Ä≠  And that these could not prove more capital
‚Ä≠  Than those the Cyclops block‚Äôd us up in, yet
‚Ä≠  My virtue, wit, and heav‚Äôn-help‚Äôd counsels set
‚Ä≠  Their freedoms open.  I could not believe
‚Ä≠  But they remember‚Äôd it, and wish‚Äôd them give
‚Ä≠  My equal care and means now equal trust.
‚Ä≠  The strength they had for stirring up they must
‚Ä≠  Rouse and extend, to try if Jove had laid
‚Ä≠  His pow‚Äôrs in theirs up, and would add his aid
‚Ä≠  To ‚Äôscape ev‚Äôn that death.  In particular then,
‚Ä≠  I told our pilot, that past other men
‚Ä≠  He most must bear firm spirits, since he sway‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The continent that all our spirits convey‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  In his whole guide of her.  He saw there boil
‚Ä≠  The fiery whirlpools that to all our spoil
‚Ä≠  Inclos‚Äôd a rock, without which he must steer,
‚Ä≠  Or all our ruins stood concluded there.
‚Ä≠     All heard me and obey‚Äôd, and little knew
‚Ä≠  That, shunning that rock, six of them should rue
‚Ä≠  The wrack another hid.  For I conceal‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The heavy wounds, that never would be heal‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  To be by Scylla open‚Äôd; for their fear
‚Ä≠  Would then have robb‚Äôd all of all care to steer,
‚Ä≠  Or stir an oar, and made them hide beneath,
‚Ä≠  When they and all had died an idle death.
‚Ä≠  But then ev‚Äôn I forgot to shun the harm
‚Ä≠  Circe forewarn‚Äôd; who will‚Äôd I should not arm,
‚Ä≠  Nor show myself to Scylla, lest in vain
‚Ä≠  I ventur‚Äôd life.  Yet could not I contain,
‚Ä≠  But arm‚Äôd at all parts, and two lances took,
‚Ä≠  Up to the foredeck went, and thence did look
‚Ä≠  That rocky Scylla would have first appear‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  And taken my life with the friends I fear‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     From thence yet no place could afford her sight,
‚Ä≠  Though through the dark rock mine eye threw her light,
‚Ä≠  And ransack‚Äôd all ways.  I then took a strait
‚Ä≠  That gave myself, and some few more, receit
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTwixt Scylla and Charybdis; whence we saw
‚Ä≠  How horridly Charybdis‚Äô throat did draw
‚Ä≠  The brackish sea up, which when all aboard
‚Ä≠  She spit again out, never caldron sod
‚Ä≠  With so much fervour, fed with all the store
‚Ä≠  That could enrage it; all the rock did roar
‚Ä≠  With troubled waters; round about the tops
‚Ä≠  Of all the steep crags flew the foamy drops.
‚Ä≠  But when her draught the sea and earth dissunder‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  The troubled bottoms turn‚Äôd up, and she thunder‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Far under shore the swart sands naked lay.
‚Ä≠  Whose whole stern sight the startled blood did fray
‚Ä≠  From all our faces.  And while we on her
‚Ä≠  Our eyes bestow‚Äôd thus to our ruin‚Äôs fear,
‚Ä≠  Six friends had Scylla snatch‚Äôd out of our keel,
‚Ä≠  In whom most loss did force and virtue feel.
‚Ä≠  When looking to my ship, and lending eye
‚Ä≠  To see my friends‚Äô estates, their heels turn‚Äôd high,
‚Ä≠  And hands cast up, I might discern, and hear
‚Ä≠  Their calls to me for help, when now they were
‚Ä≠  To try me in their last extremities.
‚Ä≠  And as an angler med‚Äôcine for surprise
‚Ä≠  Of little fish sits pouring from the rocks,
‚Ä≠  From out the crook‚Äôd horn of a fold-bred ox,
‚Ä≠  And then with his long angle hoists them high
‚Ä≠  Up to the air, then slightly hurls them by,
‚Ä≠  When helpless sprawling on the land they lie;
‚Ä≠  So eas‚Äôly Scylla to her rock had rapt
‚Ä≠  My woeful friends, and so unhelp‚Äôd entrapt
‚Ä≠  Struggling they lay beneath her violent rape,
‚Ä≠  Who in their tortures, desp‚Äôrate of escape,
‚Ä≠  Shriek‚Äôd as she tore, and up their hands to me
‚Ä≠  Still threw for sweet life.  I did never see,
‚Ä≠  In all my suff‚Äôrance ransacking the seas,
‚Ä≠  A spectacle so full of miseries.
‚Ä≠     Thus having fled these rocks (these cruel dames
‚Ä≠  Scylla, Charybdis) where the King of flames
‚Ä≠  Hath off‚Äôrings burn‚Äôd to him, our ship put in
‚Ä≠  The island that from all the earth doth win
‚Ä≠  The epithet _Faultless,_ where the broad-of-head
‚Ä≠  And famous oxen for the Sun are fed,
‚Ä≠  With many fat flocks of that high-gone God.
‚Ä≠  Set in my ship, mine ear reach‚Äôd where we rode
‚Ä≠  The bellowing of oxen, and the bleat
‚Ä≠  Of fleecy sheep, that in my memory‚Äôs seat
‚Ä≠  Put up the forms that late had been imprest
‚Ä≠  By dread √Ü√¶n Circe, and the best
‚Ä≠  Of souls and prophets, the blind Theban seer,
‚Ä≠  The wise Tiresias, who was grave decreer
‚Ä≠  Of my return‚Äôs whole means; of which this one
‚Ä≠  In chief he urg‚Äôd--that I should always shun
‚Ä≠  The island of the man-delighting Sun.
‚Ä≠  When, sad at heart for our late loss, I pray‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  My friends to hear fit counsel (though dismay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With all ill fortunes) which was giv‚Äôn to me
‚Ä≠  By Circe‚Äôs and Tiresias‚Äô prophecy,--
‚Ä≠  That I should fly the isle where was ador‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The Comfort of the world, for ills abhorr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Were ambush‚Äôd for us there; and therefore will‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  They should put off and leave the isle.  This kill‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Their tender spirits; when Eurylochus
‚Ä≠  A speech that vex‚Äôd me utter‚Äôd, answ‚Äôring thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄòCruel Ulysses!  Since thy nerves abound
‚Ä≠  In strength, the more spent, and no toils confound
‚Ä≠  Thy able limbs, as all beat out of steel,
‚Ä≠  Thou ablest us too, as unapt to feel
‚Ä≠  The teeth of Labour, and the spoil of Sleep,
‚Ä≠  And therefore still wet waste us in the deep,
‚Ä≠  Nor let us land to eat, but madly now
‚Ä≠  In night put forth, and leave firm land to strew
‚Ä≠  The sea with errors.  All the rabid flight
‚Ä≠  Of winds that ruin ships are bred in night.
‚Ä≠  Who is it that can keep off cruel Death,
‚Ä≠  If suddenly should rush out th‚Äô angry breath
‚Ä≠  Of Notus, or the eager-spirited West,
‚Ä≠  That cuff ships dead, and do the Gods their best?
‚Ä≠  Serve black Night still with shore, meat, sleep, and ease,
‚Ä≠  And offer to the Morning for the seas.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This all the rest approv‚Äôd, and then knew I
‚Ä≠  That past all doubt the Devil did apply
‚Ä≠  His slaught‚Äôrous works.  Nor would they be withheld;
‚Ä≠  I was but one, nor yielded but compell‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  But all that might contain them I assay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  A sacred oath on all their pow‚Äôrs I laid,
‚Ä≠  That if with herds or any richest-flocks
‚Ä≠  We chanc‚Äôd t‚Äô encounter, neither sheep nor ox
‚Ä≠  We once should touch, nor (for that constant ill
‚Ä≠  That follows folly) scorn advice and kill,
‚Ä≠  But quiet sit us down and take such food
‚Ä≠  As the immortal Circe had bestow‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     They swore all this in all severest sort;
‚Ä≠  And then we anchor‚Äôd in the winding port
‚Ä≠  Near a fresh river, where the long‚Äôd-for shore
‚Ä≠  They all flew out to, took in victuals store,
‚Ä≠  And, being full, thought of their friends, and wept
‚Ä≠  Their loss by Scylla, weeping till they slept.
‚Ä≠     In night‚Äôs third part, when stars began to stoop,
‚Ä≠  The Cloud-assembler put a tempest up.
‚Ä≠  A boist‚Äôrous spirit he gave it, drave out all
‚Ä≠  His flocks of clouds, and let such darkness fall
‚Ä≠  That Earth and Seas, for fear, to hide were driv‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  For with his clouds he thrust out Night from heav‚Äôn.
‚Ä≠     At morn we drew our ships into a cave,
‚Ä≠  In which the Nymphs that Ph≈ìbus‚Äô cattle drave
‚Ä≠  Fair dancing-rooms had, and their seats of state.
‚Ä≠  I urg‚Äôd my friends then, that, to shun their fate,
‚Ä≠  They would observe their oath, and take the food
‚Ä≠  Our ship afforded, nor attempt the blood
‚Ä≠  Of those fair herds and flocks, because they were
‚Ä≠  The dreadful God‚Äôs that all could see and hear.
‚Ä≠     They stood observant, and in that good mind
‚Ä≠  Had we been gone; but so adverse the wind
‚Ä≠  Stood to our passage, that we could not go.
‚Ä≠  For one whole month perpetually did blow
‚Ä≠  Impetuous Notus, not a breath‚Äôs repair
‚Ä≠  But his and Eurus‚Äô rul‚Äôd in all the air.
‚Ä≠  As long yet as their ruddy wine and bread
‚Ä≠  Stood out amongst them, so long not a head
‚Ä≠  Of all those oxen fell in any strife
‚Ä≠  Amongst those students for the gut and life;
‚Ä≠  But when their victuals fail‚Äôd they fell to prey,
‚Ä≠  Necessity compell‚Äôd them then to stray
‚Ä≠  In rape of fish and fowl; whatever came
‚Ä≠  In reach of hand or hook, the belly‚Äôs flame
‚Ä≠  Afflicted to it.  I then fell to pray‚Äôr,
‚Ä≠  And (making to a close retreat repair,
‚Ä≠  Free from both friends and winds) I wash‚Äôd my hands,
‚Ä≠  And all the Gods besought, that held commands
‚Ä≠  In liberal heav‚Äôn, to yield some mean to stay
‚Ä≠  Their desp‚Äôrate hunger, and set up the way
‚Ä≠  Of our return restrain‚Äôd.  The Gods, instead
‚Ä≠  Of giving what I pray‚Äôd for--pow‚Äôr of deed--
‚Ä≠  A deedless sleep did on my lids distill,
‚Ä≠  For mean to work upon my friends their fill.
‚Ä≠  For whiles I slept, there wak‚Äôd no mean to curb
‚Ä≠  Their headstrong wants; which he that did disturb
‚Ä≠  My rule in chief at all times, and was chief
‚Ä≠  To all the rest in counsel to their grief,
‚Ä≠  Knew well, and of my present absence took
‚Ä≠  His fit advantage, and their iron strook
‚Ä≠  At highest heat.  For, feeling their desire
‚Ä≠  In his own entrails, to allay the fire
‚Ä≠  That Famine blew in them, he thus gave way
‚Ä≠  To that affection:  ‚ÄòHear what I shall say,
‚Ä≠  Though words will staunch no hunger, ev‚Äôry death
‚Ä≠  To us poor wretches that draw temporal breath
‚Ä≠  You know is hateful; but, all know, to die
‚Ä≠  The death of Famine is a misery
‚Ä≠  Past all death loathsome.  Let us, therefore, take
‚Ä≠  The chief of this fair herd, and off‚Äôrings make
‚Ä≠  To all the Deathless that in broad heav‚Äôn live,
‚Ä≠  And in particular vow, if we arrive
‚Ä≠  In natural Ithaca, to straight erect
‚Ä≠  A temple to the Haughty-in-aspect,
‚Ä≠  Rich and magnificent, and all within
‚Ä≠  Deck it with relics many and divine.
‚Ä≠  If yet he stands incens‚Äôd, since we have slain
‚Ä≠  His high-brow‚Äôd herd, and, therefore, will sustain
‚Ä≠  Desire to wrack our ship, he is but one,
‚Ä≠  And all the other Gods that we atone
‚Ä≠  With our divine rites will their suffrage give
‚Ä≠  To our design‚Äôd return, and let us live.
‚Ä≠  If not, and all take part, I rather crave
‚Ä≠  To serve with one sole death the yawning wave,
‚Ä≠  Than in a desert island lie and sterve,
‚Ä≠  And with one pin‚Äôd life many deaths observe.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     All cried  ‚ÄòHe counsels nobly,‚Äô  and all speed
‚Ä≠  Made to their resolute driving; for the feed
‚Ä≠  Of those coal-black, fair, broad-brow‚Äôd, sun-lov‚Äôd beeves
‚Ä≠  Had place close by our ships.  They took the lives
‚Ä≠  Of sence, most eminent; about their fall
‚Ä≠  Stood round, and to the States Celestial
‚Ä≠  Made solemn vows; but other rites their ship
‚Ä≠  Could not afford them, they did, therefore, strip
‚Ä≠  The curl‚Äôd-head oak of fresh young leaves, to make
‚Ä≠  Supply of service for their barley-cake.
‚Ä≠  And on the sacredly-enflam‚Äôd, for wine,
‚Ä≠  Pour‚Äôd purest water, all the parts divine
‚Ä≠  Spitting and roasting; all the rites beside
‚Ä≠  Orderly using.  Then did light divide
‚Ä≠  My low and upper lids; when, my repair
‚Ä≠  Made near my ship, I met the delicate air
‚Ä≠  Their roast exhal‚Äôd; out instantly I cried,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄòO Jove, and all ye Deified,
‚Ä≠  Ye have oppress‚Äôd me with a cruel sleep,
‚Ä≠  While ye conferr‚Äôd on me a loss as deep
‚Ä≠  As Death descends to.  To themselves alone
‚Ä≠  My rude men left ungovern‚Äôd, they have done
‚Ä≠  A deed so impious, I stand well assur‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  That you will not forgive though ye procur‚Äôd.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     Then flew Lampeti√© with the ample robe
‚Ä≠  Up to her father with the golden globe,
‚Ä≠  Ambassadress t‚Äô inform him that my men
‚Ä≠  Had slain his oxen.  Heart-incensed then,
‚Ä≠  He cried:  ‚ÄòRevenge me, Father, and the rest
‚Ä≠  Both ever-living and for ever blest!
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô impious men have drawn the blood
‚Ä≠  Of those my oxen that it did me good
‚Ä≠  To look on, walking all my starry round,
‚Ä≠  And when I trod earth all with meadows crown‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Without your full amends I‚Äôll leave heav‚Äôn quite,
‚Ä≠  Dis and the dead adorning with my light.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     The Cloud-herd answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄòSon!  Thou shalt be ours,
‚Ä≠  And light those mortals in that mine of flow‚Äôrs!
‚Ä≠  My red-hot flash shall graze but on their ship,
‚Ä≠  And eat it, burning, in the boiling deep.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This by Calypso I was told, and she
‚Ä≠  Inform‚Äôd it from the verger Mercury.
‚Ä≠     Come to our ship, I chid and told by name
‚Ä≠  Each man how impiously he was to blame.
‚Ä≠  But chiding got no peace, and beeves were slain!
‚Ä≠  When straight the Gods forewent their following pain
‚Ä≠  With dire ostents.  The hides the flesh had lost
‚Ä≠  Crept all before them.  As the flesh did roast,
‚Ä≠  It bellow‚Äôd like the ox itself alive.
‚Ä≠  And yet my soldiers did their dead beeves drive
‚Ä≠  Through all these prodigies in daily feasts.
‚Ä≠  Six days they banqueted and slew fresh beasts;
‚Ä≠  And when the sev‚Äônth day Jove reduc‚Äôd the wind
‚Ä≠  That all the month rag‚Äôd, and so in did bind
‚Ä≠  Our ship and us, was turn‚Äôd and calm‚Äôd, and we
‚Ä≠  Launch‚Äôd, put up masts, sails hoised, and to sea.
‚Ä≠     The island left so far that land nowhere
‚Ä≠  But only sea and sky had pow‚Äôr t‚Äô appear,
‚Ä≠  Jove fix‚Äôd a cloud above our ship, so black
‚Ä≠  That all the sea it darken‚Äôd.  Yet from wrack
‚Ä≠  She ran a good free time, till from the West
‚Ä≠  Came Zephyr ruffling forth, and put his breast
‚Ä≠  Out in a singing tempest, so most vast
‚Ä≠  It burst the gables that made sure our mast.
‚Ä≠  Our masts came tumbling down, our cattle down
‚Ä≠  Rush‚Äôd to the pump, and by our pilot‚Äôs crown
‚Ä≠  The main-mast pass‚Äôd his fall, pash‚Äôd all his skull,
‚Ä≠  And all this wrack but one flaw made at full.
‚Ä≠  Off from the stern the sternsman diving fell,
‚Ä≠  And from his sinews flew his soul to hell.
‚Ä≠  Together all this time Jove‚Äôs thunder chid,
‚Ä≠  And through and through the ship his lightning glid,
‚Ä≠  Till it embrac‚Äôd her round; her bulk was fill‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With nasty sulphur, and her men were kill‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Tumbled to sea, like sea-mews swum about,
‚Ä≠  And there the date of their return was out.
‚Ä≠     I toss‚Äôd from side to side still, till all-broke
‚Ä≠  Her ribs were with the storm, and she did choke
‚Ä≠  With let-in surges; for the mast torn down
‚Ä≠  Tore her up piecemeal, and for me to drown
‚Ä≠  Left little undissolv‚Äôd.  But to the mast
‚Ä≠  There was a leather thong left, which I cast
‚Ä≠  About it and the keel, and so sat tost
‚Ä≠  With baneful weather, till the West had lost
‚Ä≠  His stormy tyranny.  And then arose
‚Ä≠  The South, that bred me more abhorr√©d woes;
‚Ä≠  For back again his blasts expell‚Äôd me quite
‚Ä≠  On ravenous Charybdis.  All that night
‚Ä≠  I totter‚Äôd up and down, till Light and I
‚Ä≠  At Scylla‚Äôs rock encounter‚Äôd, and the nigh
‚Ä≠  Dreadful Charybdis.  As I drave on these,
‚Ä≠  I saw Charybdis supping up the seas,
‚Ä≠  And had gone up together, if the tree
‚Ä≠  That bore the wild figs had not rescued me;
‚Ä≠  To which I leap‚Äôd, and left my keel, and high
‚Ä≠  Chamb‚Äôring upon it did as close imply
‚Ä≠  My breast about it as a reremouse could;
‚Ä≠  Yet might my feet on no stub fasten hold
‚Ä≠  To ease my hands, the roots were crept so low
‚Ä≠  Beneath the earth, and so aloft did grow
‚Ä≠  The far-spread arms that, though good height I gat,
‚Ä≠  I could not reach them.  To the main bole flat
‚Ä≠  I, therefore, still must cling; till up again
‚Ä≠  She belch‚Äôd my mast, and after that amain
‚Ä≠  My keel came tumbling.  So at length it chanc‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To me, as to a judge that long advanc‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To judge a sort of hot young fellows‚Äô jars,
‚Ä≠  At length time frees him from their civil wars,
‚Ä≠  When glad he riseth and to dinner goes;
‚Ä≠  So time, at length, releas‚Äôd with joys my woes,
‚Ä≠  And from Charybdis‚Äô mouth appear‚Äôd my keel.
‚Ä≠  To which, my hand now loos‚Äôd and now my heel,
‚Ä≠  I altogether with a huge noise dropp‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Just in her midst fell, where the mast was propp‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And there row‚Äôd off with owers of my hands.
‚Ä≠  God and man‚Äôs Father would not from her sands
‚Ä≠  Let Scylla see me, for I then had died
‚Ä≠  That bitter death that my poor friends supplied.
‚Ä≠     Nine days at sea I hover‚Äôd; the tenth night
‚Ä≠  In th‚Äô isle Ogygia, where, about the bright
‚Ä≠  And right renown‚Äôd Calypso, I was cast
‚Ä≠  By pow‚Äôr of Deity; where I lived embrac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With love and feasts.  But why should I relate
‚Ä≠  Those kind occurrents?  I should iterate
‚Ä≠  What I in part to your chaste queen and you
‚Ä≠  So late imparted.  And, for me to grow
‚Ä≠  A talker-over of my tale again,
‚Ä≠  Were past my free contentment to sustain.‚Äù

‚Ä≠  FINIS DUODECIMI LIBRI HOM. ODYSS.

‚Ä≠  _Opus novem dierum._

‚Ä≠  _Œ£·Ω∫ŒΩ ŒòŒµ·æ≥._

‚Ä≠[1] _Œ†·Ω≥ŒªŒµŒπŒ±Œπ œÑœÅ·ΩµœÅœâŒΩŒµœÇ.  Columb√¶ timid√¶._  What these doves were,
‚Ä≠and the whole mind of this place, the great Macedon asking Chiron
‚Ä≠Amphipolites, he answered:  They were the Pleiades or seven
‚Ä≠Stars.  One of which (besides his proper imperfection of being
‚Ä≠_·ºÄŒºœÖŒ¥œÅ·Ω∏œÇ,_ i.e. _adeo exilis, vel subobscurus, ut vix appareat_) is
‚Ä≠utterly obscured or let by these rocks. Why then, or how, Jove still
‚Ä≠supplied the lost one, that the number might be full, Athen√¶us falls
‚Ä≠to it, and helps the other out, interpreting it to be affirmed of their
‚Ä≠perpetual septenary number, though there appeared but six.  But
‚Ä≠how lame and loathsome these prosers show in their affected
‚Ä≠expositions of the poetical mind, this and an hundred others, spent
‚Ä≠in mere presumptuous guess at this inaccessible Poet, I hope will
‚Ä≠make plain enough to the most envious of any thing done, besides
‚Ä≠their own set censures and most arrogant over-weenings.  In the 23
‚Ä≠of the lliads (being _œà_) at the games celebrated at Patroclus‚Äô
‚Ä≠funerals, they tied to the top of a mast _œÄ·Ω≥ŒªŒµŒπŒ±ŒΩ œÑœÅ·ΩµœÅœâŒΩŒ±, timidam
‚Ä≠columbam,_ to shoot at for a game, so that (by these great men‚Äôs
‚Ä≠abovesaid expositions) they shot at the Pleiades.

‚Ä≠[2] _ŒùŒ∑œÖÃëœÇ œÄŒ±ÃëœÉŒπ Œº·Ω≥ŒªŒøœÖœÉŒ±,_ etc.  _Navis omnibus cur√¶:  the ship that
‚Ä≠held the care of all men, or of all things:_  which our critics will
‚Ä≠needs restrain, _omnibus heroibus, Poetis omnibus, vel Historicis,_
‚Ä≠when the care of all men‚Äôs preservation is affirmed to be the freight
‚Ä≠of it; as if poets and historians comprehended all things, when I
‚Ä≠scarce know any that makes them any part of their care.  But this
‚Ä≠likewise is garbage good enough for the monster.  Nor will I tempt
‚Ä≠our spiced consciences with expressing the divine mind it includes.
‚Ä≠Being afraid to affirm any good of poor poesy, since no man gets
‚Ä≠any goods by it.  And notwithstanding many of our bird-eyed
‚Ä≠starters at profanation are for nothing so afraid of it; as that lest
‚Ä≠their galled consciences (scarce believing the most real truth, in
‚Ä≠approbation of their lives) should be rubbed with the confirmation
‚Ä≠of it, even in these contemned vanities (as their impieties please to
‚Ä≠call them) which by much more learned and pious than themselves
‚Ä≠have ever been called the raptures of divine inspiration, by which,
‚Ä≠_Homo supra humanam naturam erigitur, et in Deum transit._--Plat.

‚Ä≠[3] _ŒîŒµŒπŒΩ·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒªŒµŒªŒ±Œ∫œÖŒπÃëŒ±,_ etc.  _Graviter vociferans;_  as all most
‚Ä≠untruly translate it.  As they do in the next verse these words
‚Ä≠_œÉŒ∫·ΩªŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒøœÇ ŒΩŒµŒøŒ≥ŒπŒªŒ∑ÃëœÇ catuli leonis,_ no lion being here dreamed of,
‚Ä≠nor any vociferation.  _ŒîŒµŒπŒΩ·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒªŒµŒªŒ±Œ∫œÖŒπÃëŒ±_ signifying _indignam,
‚Ä≠dissimilem,_ or _horribilem vocem edens:_  but in what kind
‚Ä≠_horribilem?_  Not for the gravity or greatness of her voice, but for
‚Ä≠the unworthy or disproportionable small whuling of it; she being in
‚Ä≠the vast frame of her body, as the very words _œÄ·Ω≥ŒªœâœÅ Œ∫Œ±Œ∫·Ω∏ŒΩ_
‚Ä≠signify, _monstrum ingens;_ whose disproportion and deformity is
‚Ä≠too poetically (and therein elegantly) ordered for fat and flat
‚Ä≠prosers to comprehend.  Nor could they make the Poet‚Äôs words
‚Ä≠serve their comprehension; and therefore they add of their own,
‚Ä≠_Œª·Ω±œÉŒ∫œâ,_ from whence _ŒªŒµŒªŒ±Œ∫œÖŒπÃëŒ±_ is derived, signifying _crepo,_
‚Ä≠or _stridul√™ clamo._  And _œÉŒ∫·ΩªŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒøœÇ ŒΩŒµŒøŒ≥ŒπŒªŒ∑ÃëœÇ_ is to be
‚Ä≠expounded, _catuli nuper_ or _recens nati,_ not _leonis._ But thus
‚Ä≠they botch and abuse the incomparable expressor, because they
‚Ä≠knew not how otherwise to be monstrous enough themselves to
‚Ä≠help out the monster.  Imagining so huge a great body must needs
‚Ä≠have a voice as huge; and then would not our Homer have likened
‚Ä≠it to a lion‚Äôs whelp‚Äôs voice, but to the lion‚Äôs own; and all had been
‚Ä≠much too little to make a voice answerable to her hugeness.  And
‚Ä≠therefore found our inimitable master a new way to express her
‚Ä≠monstrous disproportion; performing it so, as there can be _nihil
‚Ä≠supr√¢._ And I would fain learn of my learned detractor, that will
‚Ä≠needs have me only translate out of the Latin, what Latin
‚Ä≠translation tells me this?  Or what Grecian hath ever found this and
‚Ä≠a hundred other such?  Which may be some poor instance, or
‚Ä≠proof, of my Grecian faculty, as far as old Homer goes in his two
‚Ä≠simple Poems, but not a syllable further will my silly spirit
‚Ä≠presume.



‚Ä≠  THE THIRTEENTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Ulysses (shipp‚Äôd, but in the even,
‚Ä≠  With all the presents he was given,
‚Ä≠  And sleeping then) is set next morn
‚Ä≠  In full scope of his wish‚Äôd return,
‚Ä≠  And treads unknown his country-shore,
‚Ä≠  Whose search so many winters wore.
‚Ä≠  The ship (returning, and arriv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Against the city) is depriv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of form, and, all her motion gone,
‚Ä≠  Transform‚Äôd by Neptune to a stone.
‚Ä≠     Ulysses (let to know the strand
‚Ä≠  Where the Ph√¶acians made him land)
‚Ä≠  Consults with Pallas, for the life
‚Ä≠  Of ev‚Äôry wooer of his wife.
‚Ä≠  His gifts she hides within a cave,
‚Ä≠  And him into a man more grave,
‚Ä≠  All hid in wrinkles, crook√©d, gray,
‚Ä≠  Transform‚Äôd; who so goes on his way.
‚Ä≠
‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _ŒùœÖÃë._
‚Ä≠     Ph√¶acia
‚Ä≠        Ulysses leaves;
‚Ä≠     Whom Ithaca,
‚Ä≠        Unwares, receives.

‚Ä≠  He said; and silence all their tongues contain‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  In admiration, when with pleasure chain‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Their ears had long been to him.  At last brake
‚Ä≠  Alcinous silence, and in this sort spake
‚Ä≠  To th‚Äô Ithacensian, Laertes‚Äô son:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúO Ithacus!  However over-run
‚Ä≠  With former suff‚Äôrings in your way for home,
‚Ä≠  Since ‚Äôtwas, at last, your happy fate to come
‚Ä≠  To my high-roof‚Äôd and brass-foundation‚Äôd house,
‚Ä≠  I hope, such speed and pass auspicious
‚Ä≠  Our loves shall yield you, that you shall no more
‚Ä≠  Wander, nor suffer, homewards, as before.
‚Ä≠     You then, whoever that are ever grac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With all choice of authoriz‚Äôd pow‚Äôr to taste
‚Ä≠  Such wine with me as warms the sacred rage,
‚Ä≠  And is an honorary giv‚Äôn to age,  [1]
‚Ä≠  With which ye likewise hear divinely sing,
‚Ä≠  In honour‚Äôs praise, the poet of the king,
‚Ä≠  I move, by way of my command, to this:
‚Ä≠  That where in an elaborate chest there lies
‚Ä≠  A present for our guest, attires of price,
‚Ä≠  And gold engrav‚Äôn with infinite device,
‚Ä≠  I wish that each of us should add beside
‚Ä≠  A tripod, and a caldron, amplified
‚Ä≠  With size, and metal of most rate, and great;
‚Ä≠  For we, in council of taxation met,
‚Ä≠  Will from our subjects gain their worth again;
‚Ä≠  Since ‚Äôtis unequal one man should sustain
‚Ä≠  A charge so weighty, being the grace of all,
‚Ä≠  Which borne by many is a weight but small.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus spake Alcinous, and pleas‚Äôd the rest;
‚Ä≠  When each man clos‚Äôd with home and sleep his feast.
‚Ä≠  But when the colour-giving light arose,
‚Ä≠  All to the ship did all their speeds dispose,  [2]
‚Ä≠  And wealth, that honest men makes, brought with them.  [3]
‚Ä≠  All which ev‚Äôn he that wore the diadem
‚Ä≠  Stow‚Äôd in the ship himself, beneath the seats
‚Ä≠  The rowers sat in, stooping, lest their lets
‚Ä≠  In any of their labours he might prove.
‚Ä≠  Then home he turn‚Äôd, and after him did move
‚Ä≠  The whole assembly to expected feast.
‚Ä≠  Among whom he a sacrifice addrest,
‚Ä≠  And slew an ox, to weather-wielding Jove,
‚Ä≠  Beneath whose empire all things are, and move.
‚Ä≠     The thighs then roasting, they made glorious cheer
‚Ä≠  Delighted highly; and amongst them there
‚Ä≠  The honour‚Äôd-of-the-people us‚Äôd his voice,
‚Ä≠  Divine Demodocus.  Yet, through this choice
‚Ä≠  Of cheer and music, had Ulysses still
‚Ä≠  An eye directed to the Eastern hill,
‚Ä≠  To see Him rising that illustrates all;
‚Ä≠  For now into his mind a fire did fall
‚Ä≠  Of thirst for home.  And as in hungry vow
‚Ä≠  To needful food a man at fix√©d plow
‚Ä≠  (To whom the black ox all day long hath turn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The stubborn fallows up, his stomach burn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With empty heat and appetite to food,
‚Ä≠  His knees afflicted with his spirit-spent blood)
‚Ä≠  At length the long-expected sunset sees,
‚Ä≠  That he may sit to food, and rest his knees;
‚Ä≠  So to Ulysses set the friendly light
‚Ä≠  The sun afforded, with as wish‚Äôd a sight.
‚Ä≠  Who straight bespake that oar-affecting State,
‚Ä≠  But did in chief his speech appropriate
‚Ä≠  To him by name, that with their rule was crown‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAlcinous, of all men most renown‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Dismiss me with as safe pass as you vow
‚Ä≠  (Your off‚Äôring past) and may the Gods to you
‚Ä≠  In all contentment use as full a hand;
‚Ä≠  For now my landing here and stay shall stand
‚Ä≠  In all perfection with my heart‚Äôs desire,
‚Ä≠  Both my so safe deduction to aspire,
‚Ä≠  And loving gifts; which may the Gods to me
‚Ä≠  As blest in use make as your acts are free,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn to the finding firm in love, and life,
‚Ä≠  With all desir‚Äôd event, my friends, and wife.
‚Ä≠  When, as myself shall live delighted there,
‚Ä≠  May you with your wives rest as happy here,
‚Ä≠  Your sons and daughters, in particular state,
‚Ä≠  With ev‚Äôry virtue render‚Äôd consummate;
‚Ä≠  And, in your gen‚Äôral empire, may ill never
‚Ä≠  Approach your land, but good your good quit ever.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This all applauded, and all jointly cried:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúDismiss the stranger!  He hath dignified
‚Ä≠  With fit speech his dismission.‚Äù  Then the king
‚Ä≠  Thus charg‚Äôd the herald:  ‚ÄúFill for offering
‚Ä≠  A bowl of wine; which through the whole large house
‚Ä≠  Dispose to all men, that, propitious
‚Ä≠  Our father Jove made with our pray‚Äôrs, we may
‚Ä≠  Give home our guest in full and wish√©d way.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, Pontonous commix‚Äôd a bowl
‚Ä≠  Of such sweet wine as did delight the soul.
‚Ä≠  Which making sacred to the blessed Gods,
‚Ä≠  That hold in broad heav‚Äôn their supreme abodes,
‚Ä≠  God-like Ulysses from his chair arose,
‚Ä≠  And in the hands of th‚Äô empress did impose
‚Ä≠  The all-round cup; to whom, fair spoke, he said:
‚Ä≠    ‚ÄúRejoice, O queen, and be your joys repaid
‚Ä≠  By heav‚Äôn, for me, till age and death succeed;
‚Ä≠  Both which inflict their most unwelcome need
‚Ä≠  On men and dames alike.  And, first, for me,
‚Ä≠  I must from hence, to both: Live you here free,
‚Ä≠  And ever may all living blessings spring,
‚Ä≠  Your joy in children, subjects, and your king.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, divine Ulysses took his way;
‚Ä≠  Before whom the unalterable sway
‚Ä≠  Of king Alcinous‚Äô virtue did command
‚Ä≠  A herald‚Äôs fit attendance to the strand,
‚Ä≠  And ship appointed.  With him likewise went
‚Ä≠  Handmaids, by Arete‚Äôs injunction sent.
‚Ä≠  One bore an out and in-weed, fair and sweet,
‚Ä≠  The other an embroider‚Äôd cabinet,
‚Ä≠  The third had bread to bear, and ruddy wine;
‚Ä≠  All which, at sea and ship arriv‚Äôd, resign
‚Ä≠  Their freight conferr‚Äôd.  With fair attendants then,
‚Ä≠  The sheets and bedding of the man of men,
‚Ä≠  Within a cabin of the hollow keel,
‚Ä≠  Spread, and made soft, that sleep might sweetly seel
‚Ä≠  His restful eyes, he enter‚Äôd, and his bed
‚Ä≠  In silence took.  The rowers order√©d
‚Ä≠  Themselves in sev‚Äôral seats, and then set gone
‚Ä≠  The ship, the gable from the hollow stone
‚Ä≠  Dissolv‚Äôd and weigh‚Äôd-up, all, together, close
‚Ä≠  Then beat the sea.  His lids in sweet repose
‚Ä≠  Sleep bound so fast, it scarce gave way to breath
‚Ä≠  Inexcitable, most dear, next of all to death.
‚Ä≠  And as amids a fair field four brave horse
‚Ä≠  Before a chariot stung into their course
‚Ä≠  With fervent lashes of the smarting scourge,
‚Ä≠  That all their fire blows high, and makes them urge
‚Ä≠  To utmost speed the measure of their ground;
‚Ä≠  So bore the ship aloft her fiery bound;
‚Ä≠  About whom rush‚Äôd the billows black and vast,
‚Ä≠  In which the sea-roars burst.  As firm as fast
‚Ä≠  She ply‚Äôd her course yet; nor her wing√©d speed
‚Ä≠  The falcon-gentle could for pace exceed;
‚Ä≠  So cut she through the waves, and bore a man
‚Ä≠  Even with the Gods in counsels, that began
‚Ä≠  And spent his former life in all misease,
‚Ä≠  Battles of men, and rude waves of the seas,
‚Ä≠  Yet now securely slept, forgetting all.
‚Ä≠  And when heav‚Äôn‚Äôs brightest star, that first doth call
‚Ä≠  The early morning out, advanc‚Äôd her head,
‚Ä≠  Then near to Ithaca the billow-bred
‚Ä≠  Phr√¶cian ship approach‚Äôd.  There is a port,
‚Ä≠  That th‚Äô aged sea-God Phorcys makes his fort,
‚Ä≠  Whose earth the Ithacensian people own,
‚Ä≠  In which two rocks inaccessible are grown
‚Ä≠  Far forth into the sea, whose each strength binds
‚Ä≠  The boist‚Äôrous waves in from the high-flown winds
‚Ä≠  On both the out-parts so, that all within
‚Ä≠  The well-built ships, that once their harbour win
‚Ä≠  In his calm bosom, without anchor rest,
‚Ä≠  Safe, and unstirr‚Äôd.  From forth the haven‚Äôs high crest
‚Ä≠  Branch the well-brawn‚Äôd arms of an olive-tree;
‚Ä≠  Beneath which runs a cave from all sun free,
‚Ä≠  Cool, and delightsome, sacred to th‚Äô access
‚Ä≠  Of Nymphs whose surnames are the Naiad√©s;
‚Ä≠  In which flew humming bees, in which lay thrown
‚Ä≠  Stone cups, stone vessels, shittles all of stone,
‚Ä≠  With which the Nymphs their purple mantles wove,
‚Ä≠  In whose contexture art and wonder strove;
‚Ä≠  In which pure springs perpetually ran;
‚Ä≠  To which two entries were; the one for man,
‚Ä≠  On which the North breath‚Äôd;  th‚Äô other for the Gods,
‚Ä≠  On which the South; and that bore no abodes
‚Ä≠  For earthy men, but only deathless feet
‚Ä≠  Had there free way.  This port these men thought meet
‚Ä≠  To land Ulysses, being the first they knew,
‚Ä≠  Drew then their ship in, but no further drew
‚Ä≠  Than half her bulk reach‚Äôd, by such cunning hand
‚Ä≠  Her course was manag‚Äôd.  Then her men took land,
‚Ä≠  And first brought forth Ulysses, bed, and all
‚Ä≠  That richly furnish‚Äôd it, he still in thrall
‚Ä≠  Of all-subduing sleep.  Upon the sand
‚Ä≠  They set him softly down; and then the strand
‚Ä≠  They strew‚Äôd with all the goods he had, bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By the renown‚Äôd Ph√¶acians, since he show‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  So much Minerva.  At the olive root
‚Ä≠  They drew them then in heap, most far from foot
‚Ä≠  Of any traveller, lest, ere his eyes
‚Ä≠  Resum‚Äôd their charge, they might be others‚Äô prise.
‚Ä≠     These then turn‚Äôd home; nor was the sea‚Äôs Supreme
‚Ä≠  Forgetful of his threats, for Polypheme
‚Ä≠  Bent at divine Ulysses, yet would prove
‚Ä≠  (Ere their performance) the decree of Jove.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúFather!  no more the Gods shall honour me,
‚Ä≠  Since men despise me, and those men that see
‚Ä≠  The light in lineage of mine own lov‚Äôd race.  [4]
‚Ä≠  I vow‚Äôd Ulysses should, before the grace
‚Ä≠  Of his return, encounter woes enow
‚Ä≠  To make that purchase dear; yet did not vow
‚Ä≠  Simply against it, since thy brow had bent
‚Ä≠  To his reduction, in the fore-consent
‚Ä≠  Thou hadst vouchsaf‚Äôd it; yet, before my mind
‚Ä≠  Hath full pow‚Äôr on him, the Ph√¶acians find
‚Ä≠  Their own minds‚Äô satisfaction with his pass,
‚Ä≠  So far from suff‚Äôring what my pleasure was,
‚Ä≠  That ease and softness now is habited
‚Ä≠  In his secure breast, and his careless head
‚Ä≠  Return‚Äôd in peace of sleep to Ithaca,
‚Ä≠  The brass and gold of rich Ph√¶acia
‚Ä≠  Rocking his temples, garments richly wov‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  And worlds of prise, more than was ever strov‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  From all the conflicts he sustain‚Äôd at Troy,
‚Ä≠  If safe he should his full share there enjoy.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The Show‚Äôr-dissolver answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúWhat a speech
‚Ä≠  Hath pass‚Äôd thy palate, O thou great in reach
‚Ä≠  Of wrackful empire!  Far the Gods remain
‚Ä≠  From scorn of thee, for ‚Äôtwere a work of pain
‚Ä≠  To prosecute with ignominies one
‚Ä≠  That sways our ablest and most ancient throne.
‚Ä≠  For men, if any so beneath in pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  Neglect thy high will, now, or any hour
‚Ä≠  That moves hereafter, take revenge to thee,
‚Ä≠  Soothe all thy will, and be thy pleasure free.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúWhy then,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúthou blacker of the fumes
‚Ä≠  That dim the sun, my licens‚Äôd pow‚Äôr resumes
‚Ä≠  Act from thy speech; but I observe so much
‚Ä≠  And fear thy pleasure, that, I dare not touch
‚Ä≠  At any inclination of mine own,
‚Ä≠  Till thy consenting influence be known.
‚Ä≠  But now this curious-built Ph√¶acian ship,
‚Ä≠  Returning from her convoy, I will strip
‚Ä≠  Of all her fleeting matter, and to stone
‚Ä≠  Transform and fix it, just when she hath gone
‚Ä≠  Her full time home, and jets before their prease
‚Ä≠  In all her trim, amids the sable seas,
‚Ä≠  That they may cease to convoy strangers still,
‚Ä≠  When they shall see so like a mighty hill
‚Ä≠  Their glory stick before their city‚Äôs grace,
‚Ä≠  And my hands cast a mask before her face.‚Äù  [5]
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO friend,‚Äù  said Jove,  ‚Äúit shows to me the best
‚Ä≠  Of all earth‚Äôs objects, that their whole prease, drest
‚Ä≠  In all their wonder, near their town shall stand,
‚Ä≠  And stare upon a stone, so near the land,
‚Ä≠  So like a ship, and dam up all their lights,
‚Ä≠  As if a mountain interpos‚Äôd their sights.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     When Neptune heard this, he for Scheria went,
‚Ä≠  Whence the Ph√¶acians took their first descent.
‚Ä≠  Which when he reach‚Äôd, and, in her swiftest pride,
‚Ä≠  The water-treader by the city‚Äôs side
‚Ä≠  Came cutting close, close he came swiftly on,
‚Ä≠  Took her in violent hand, and to a stone
‚Ä≠  Turn‚Äôd all her sylvan substance; all below
‚Ä≠  Firm‚Äôd her with roots, and left her.  This strange show
‚Ä≠  When the Ph√¶acians saw, they stupid stood,
‚Ä≠  And ask‚Äôd each other, who amids the flood
‚Ä≠  Could fix their ship so in her full speed home,
‚Ä≠  And quite transparent make her bulk become?
‚Ä≠     Thus talk‚Äôd they; but were far from knowing how
‚Ä≠  These things had issue.  Which their king did show,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúO friends, the ancient prophecies
‚Ä≠  My father told to me, to all our eyes
‚Ä≠  Are now in proof.  He said, the time would come,
‚Ä≠  When Neptune, for our safe conducting home
‚Ä≠  All sorts of strangers, out of envy fir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Would meet our fairest ship as she retir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And all the goodly shape and speed we boast
‚Ä≠  Should like a mountain stand before us lost
‚Ä≠  Amids the moving waters; which we see
‚Ä≠  Perform‚Äôd in full end to our prophecy.
‚Ä≠  Hear then my counsel, and obey me then:
‚Ä≠  Renounce henceforth our convoy home of men,
‚Ä≠  Whoever shall hereafter greet our town;
‚Ä≠  And to th‚Äô offended Deity‚Äôs renown
‚Ä≠  Twelve chosen oxen let us sacred make,
‚Ä≠  That he may pity us, and from us take
‚Ä≠  This shady mountain.  They, in fear, obey‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Slew all the beeves, and to the Godhead pray‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  The dukes and princes all ensphering round
‚Ä≠  The sacred altar; while whose tops were crown‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Divine Ulysses, on his country‚Äôs breast
‚Ä≠  Laid bound in sleep, now rose out of his rest,
‚Ä≠  Nor (being so long remov‚Äôd) the region knew.
‚Ä≠  Besides which absence yet, Minerva threw
‚Ä≠  A cloud about him, to make strange the more
‚Ä≠  His safe arrival, lest upon his shore
‚Ä≠  He should make known his face, and utter all
‚Ä≠  That might prevent th‚Äô event that was to fall.
‚Ä≠  Which she prepar‚Äôd so well, that not his wife,
‚Ä≠  Presented to him, should perceive his life,
‚Ä≠  No citizen, no friend, till righteous fate
‚Ä≠  Upon the Wooer‚Äôs wrongs were consummate.
‚Ä≠  Through which cloud all things show‚Äôd now to the king
‚Ä≠  Of foreign fashion; the enflow‚Äôr√©d spring
‚Ä≠  Amongst the trees there, the perpetual waves,
‚Ä≠  The rocks, that did more high their foreheads raise
‚Ä≠  To his wrapt eye than naturally they did,
‚Ä≠  And all the haven, in which a man seem‚Äôd hid
‚Ä≠  From wind and weather, when storms loudest chid.
‚Ä≠     He therefore, being risen, stood and view‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His country-earth; which, not perceiv‚Äôd, he rued,
‚Ä≠  And, striking with his hurl‚Äôd-down hands his thighs,
‚Ä≠  He mourn‚Äôd, and said:  ‚ÄúO me!  Again where lies
‚Ä≠  My desert way?  To wrongful men and rude,
‚Ä≠  And with no laws of human right endued?
‚Ä≠  Or are they human, and of holy minds?
‚Ä≠  What fits my deed with these so many kinds
‚Ä≠  Of goods late giv‚Äôn?  What with myself will floods
‚Ä≠  And errors do?  I would to God, these goods
‚Ä≠  Had rested with their owners, and that I
‚Ä≠  Had fall‚Äôn on kings of more regality,
‚Ä≠  To grace out my return, that lov‚Äôd indeed,
‚Ä≠  And would have giv‚Äôn me consorts of fit speed
‚Ä≠  To my distresses‚Äô ending!  But, as now
‚Ä≠  All knowledge flies me where I may bestow
‚Ä≠  My labour‚Äôd purchase, here they shall not stay,
‚Ä≠  Lest what I car‚Äôd for others make their prey.
‚Ä≠  O Gods!  I see the great Ph√¶acians then
‚Ä≠  Were not all just and understanding men,
‚Ä≠  That land me elsewhere than their vaunts pretended,
‚Ä≠  Assuring me my country should see ended
‚Ä≠  My miseries told them, yet now eat their vaunts.
‚Ä≠  O Jove!  Great Guardian of poor suppliants,
‚Ä≠  That others sees, and notes too, shutting in
‚Ä≠  All in thy plagues that most presume on sin,
‚Ä≠  Revenge me on them.  Let me number now
‚Ä≠  The goods they gave, to give my mind to know
‚Ä≠  If they have stol‚Äôn none in their close retreat.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The goodly caldrons then, and tripods, set
‚Ä≠  In sev‚Äôral ranks from out the heap, he told,
‚Ä≠  His rich wrought garments too, and all his gold,
‚Ä≠  And nothing lack‚Äôd; and yet this man did mourn
‚Ä≠  The but suppos‚Äôd miss of his home-return,
‚Ä≠  And creeping to the shore with much complaint;
‚Ä≠  Minerva (like a shepherd, young, and quaint,  [6]
‚Ä≠  As king sons are, a double mantle cast
‚Ä≠  Athwart his shoulders, his fair goers grac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With fitted shoes, and in his hand a dart)
‚Ä≠  Appear‚Äôd to him, whose sight rejoic‚Äôd his heart,
‚Ä≠  To whom he came, and said:  ‚ÄúO friend!  Since first
‚Ä≠  I meet your sight here, be all good the worst
‚Ä≠  That can join our encounter.  Fare you fair,
‚Ä≠  Nor with adverse mind welcome my repair,
‚Ä≠  But guard these goods of mine, and succour me.
‚Ä≠  As to a God I offer pray‚Äôrs to thee,
‚Ä≠  And low access make to thy lov√©d knee.
‚Ä≠  Say truth, that I may know, what country then,
‚Ä≠  What common people live here, and what men?
‚Ä≠  Some famous isle is this?  Or gives it vent,
‚Ä≠  Being near the sea, to some rich continent?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúStranger, whatsoe‚Äôer you are,
‚Ä≠  Y‚Äôare either foolish, or come passing far,
‚Ä≠  That know not this isle, and make that doubt trouble,
‚Ä≠  For ‚Äôtis not so exceedingly ignoble,
‚Ä≠  But passing many know it; and so many,
‚Ä≠  That of all nations there abides not any,
‚Ä≠  From where the morning rises and the sun,
‚Ä≠  To where the even and night their courses run,
‚Ä≠  But know this country.  Rocky ‚Äôtis, and rough,
‚Ä≠  And so for use of horse unapt enough,
‚Ä≠  Yet with sad barrenness not much infested,  [7]
‚Ä≠  Since clouds are here in frequent rains digested,
‚Ä≠  And flow‚Äôry dews.  The compass is not great,
‚Ä≠  The little yet well-fill‚Äôd with wine and wheat.
‚Ä≠  It feeds a goat and ox well, being still
‚Ä≠  Water‚Äôd with floods, that ever over-fill
‚Ä≠  With heav‚Äôn‚Äôs continual show‚Äôrs; and wooded so,
‚Ä≠  It makes a spring of all the kinds that grow.
‚Ä≠  And therefore, Stranger, the extended name
‚Ä≠  Of this dominion makes access by fame
‚Ä≠  From this extreme part of Achaia
‚Ä≠  As far as Ilion, and ‚Äôtis Ithaca.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This joy‚Äôd him much, that so unknown a land
‚Ä≠  Turn‚Äôd to his country.  Yet so wise a hand
‚Ä≠  He carried, ev‚Äôn of this joy, flown so high,
‚Ä≠  That other end he put to his reply
‚Ä≠  Than straight to show that joy, and lay abroad
‚Ä≠  His life to strangers.  Therefore he bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A veil on truth; for evermore did wind
‚Ä≠  About his bosom a most crafty mind,
‚Ä≠  Which thus his words show‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúI have far at sea,
‚Ä≠  In spacious Crete, heard speak of Ithaca,
‚Ä≠  Of which myself, it seems, now reach the shore,
‚Ä≠  With these my fortunes; whose whole value more
‚Ä≠  I left in Crete amongst my children there,
‚Ä≠  From whence I fly for being the slaughterer
‚Ä≠  Of royal Idomen‚Äôs most-lov√©d son,
‚Ä≠  Swift-foot Orsilochus, that could out-run
‚Ä≠  Profess‚Äôd men for the race.  Yet him I slew,
‚Ä≠  Because he would deprive me of my due
‚Ä≠  In Trojan prise; for which I suffer‚Äôd so
‚Ä≠  (The rude waves piercing) the redoubled woe
‚Ä≠  Of mind and body in the wars of men.
‚Ä≠  Nor did I gratify his father then
‚Ä≠  With any service, but, as well as he
‚Ä≠  Sway‚Äôd in command of other soldiery,
‚Ä≠  So, with a friend withdrawn, we waylaid him,
‚Ä≠  When gloomy night the cope of heav‚Äôn did dim,
‚Ä≠  And no man knew; but, we lodg‚Äôd close, he came,
‚Ä≠  And I put out to him his vital flame.
‚Ä≠  Whose slaughter having author‚Äôd with my sword,
‚Ä≠  I instant flight made, and straight fell aboard
‚Ä≠  A ship of the renown‚Äôd Ph≈ìnician state;
‚Ä≠  When pray‚Äôr, and pay at a sufficient rate,
‚Ä≠  Obtain‚Äôd my pass of men in her command;
‚Ä≠  Whom I enjoin‚Äôd to set me on the land
‚Ä≠  Of Pylos, or of Elis the divine,
‚Ä≠  Where the Epe√Øans in great empire shine.
‚Ä≠  But force of weather check‚Äôd that course to them,
‚Ä≠  Though (loth to fail me) to their most extreme
‚Ä≠  They spent their willing pow‚Äôrs.   But, forc‚Äôd from thence,
‚Ä≠  We err‚Äôd, and put in here, with much expence
‚Ä≠  Of care and labour; and in dead of night,
‚Ä≠  When no man there serv‚Äôd any appetite
‚Ä≠  So much as with the memory of food,
‚Ä≠  Though our estates exceeding needy stood.
‚Ä≠  But, going ashore, we lay; when gentle sleep
‚Ä≠  My weary pow‚Äôrs invaded, and from ship
‚Ä≠  They fetching these my riches, with just hand
‚Ä≠  About me laid them, while upon the sand
‚Ä≠  Sleep bound my senses; and for Sidon they
‚Ä≠  (Put off from hence) made sail, while here I lay,
‚Ä≠  Left sad alone.‚Äù  The Goddess laugh‚Äôd, and took
‚Ä≠  His hand in hers, and with another look
‚Ä≠  (Assuming then the likeness of a dame,
‚Ä≠  Lovely and goodly, expert in the frame
‚Ä≠  Of virtuous housewif‚Äôries) she answer‚Äôd thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHe should be passing-sly, and covetous
‚Ä≠  Of stealth, in men‚Äôs deceits, that coted thee  [8]
‚Ä≠  In any craft, though any God should be
‚Ä≠  Ambitious to exceed in subtilty.
‚Ä≠  Thou still-wit-varying wretch!  Insatiate  [9]
‚Ä≠  In over-reaches!  Not secure thy state
‚Ä≠  Without these wiles, though on thy native shore
‚Ä≠  Thou sett‚Äôst safe footing, but upon thy store
‚Ä≠  Of false words still spend, that ev‚Äôn from thy birth
‚Ä≠  Have been thy best friends?  Come, our either worth
‚Ä≠  Is known to either.  Thou of men art far,
‚Ä≠  For words and counsels, the most singular,
‚Ä≠  But I above the Gods in both may boast
‚Ä≠  My still-tried faculties.  Yet thou hast lost
‚Ä≠  The knowledge ev‚Äôn of me, the Seed of Jove,
‚Ä≠  Pallas Athenia, that have still out-strove
‚Ä≠  In all thy labours their extremes, and stood
‚Ä≠  Thy sure guard ever, making all thy good
‚Ä≠  Known to the good Ph√¶acians, and receiv‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  And now again I greet thee, to see weav‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Fresh counsels for thee, and will take on me
‚Ä≠  The close reserving of these goods for thee,
‚Ä≠  Which the renown‚Äôd Ph√¶acian states bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  At thy deduction homewards, only mov‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With my both spirit and counsel.  All which grace
‚Ä≠  I now will amplify, and tell what case
‚Ä≠  Thy household stands in, utt‚Äôring all those pains
‚Ä≠  That of mere need yet still must wrack thy veins.
‚Ä≠  Do thou then freely bear, nor one word give
‚Ä≠  To man nor dame to show thou yet dost live,
‚Ä≠  But silent suffer over all again
‚Ä≠  Thy sorrows past, and bear the wrongs of men.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúGoddess,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúunjust men, and unwise,
‚Ä≠  That author injuries and vanities,
‚Ä≠  By vanities and wrongs should rather be
‚Ä≠  Bound to this ill-abearing destiny,
‚Ä≠  Than just and wise men.  What delight hath heav‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  That lives unhurt itself, to suffer giv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  Up to all domage those poor few that strive
‚Ä≠  To imitate it, and like the Deities live?
‚Ä≠  But where you wonder that I know you not
‚Ä≠  Through all your changes, that skill is not got
‚Ä≠  By sleight or art, since thy most hard-hit face
‚Ä≠  Is still distinguish‚Äôd by thy free-giv‚Äôn grace;
‚Ä≠  And therefore, truly to acknowledge thee
‚Ä≠  In thy encounters, is a mastery
‚Ä≠  In men most-knowing; for to all men thou
‚Ä≠  Tak‚Äôst sev‚Äôral likeness.  All men think they know
‚Ä≠  Thee in their wits; but, since thy seeming view
‚Ä≠  Appears to all, and yet thy truth to few,
‚Ä≠  Through all thy changes to discern thee right
‚Ä≠  Asks chief love to thee, and inspir√©d light.
‚Ä≠  But this I surely know, that, some years past,
‚Ä≠  I have been often with thy presence grac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  All time the sons of Greece wag‚Äôd war at Troy;
‚Ä≠  But when Fate‚Äôs full hour let our swords enjoy
‚Ä≠  Our vows in sack of Priam‚Äôs lofty town,
‚Ä≠  Our ships all boarded, and when God had blown
‚Ä≠  Our fleet in sunder, I could never see
‚Ä≠  The Seed of Jove, nor once distinguish thee
‚Ä≠  Boarding my ship, to take one woe from me.
‚Ä≠  But only in my proper spirit involv‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Err‚Äôd here and there, quite slain, till heav‚Äôn dissolv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Me, and my ill; which chanc‚Äôd not, till thy grace
‚Ä≠  By open speech confirm‚Äôd me, in a place
‚Ä≠  Fruitful of people, where, in person, thou
‚Ä≠  Didst give me guide, and all their city show;
‚Ä≠  And that was the renown‚Äôd Ph√¶acian earth.
‚Ä≠  Now then, ev‚Äôn by the Author of thy birth,
‚Ä≠  Vouchsafe my doubt the truth (for far it flies
‚Ä≠  My thoughts that thus should fall into mine eyes
‚Ä≠  Conspicuous Ithaca, but fear I touch
‚Ä≠  At some far shore, and that thy wit is such
‚Ä≠  Thou dost delude me) is it sure the same
‚Ä≠  Most honour‚Äôd earth that bears my country‚Äôs name?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúthou wilt be ever thus
‚Ä≠  In ev‚Äôry worldly good incredulous,
‚Ä≠  And therefore have no more the pow‚Äôr to see
‚Ä≠  Frail life more plagued with infelicity
‚Ä≠  In one so eloquent, ingenious, wise.
‚Ä≠  Another man, that so long miseries
‚Ä≠  Had kept from his lov‚Äôd home, and thus return‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To see his house, wife, children, would have burn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In headlong lust to visit.  Yet t‚Äô inquire
‚Ä≠  What states they hold, affects not thy desire,
‚Ä≠  Till thou hast tried if in thy wife there be
‚Ä≠  A sorrow wasting days and nights for thee
‚Ä≠  In loving tears, that then the sight may prove
‚Ä≠  A full reward for either‚Äôs mutual love.
‚Ä≠  But I would never credit in you both
‚Ä≠  Least cause of sorrow, but well knew the troth
‚Ä≠  Of this thine own return, though all thy friends,
‚Ä≠  I knew as well, should make returnless ends;
‚Ä≠  Yet would not cross mine uncle Neptune so
‚Ä≠  To stand their safeguard, since so high did go
‚Ä≠  His wrath for thy extinction of the eye
‚Ä≠  Of his lov‚Äôd son.  Come then, I‚Äôll show thee why
‚Ä≠  I call this isle thy Ithaca, to ground
‚Ä≠  Thy credit on my words: This haven is own‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By th‚Äô ag√©d sea-god Phorcys, in whose brow
‚Ä≠  This is the olive with the ample bough,
‚Ä≠  And here, close by, the pleasant-shaded cave
‚Ä≠  That to the Fount-Nymphs th‚Äô Ithacensians gave,
‚Ä≠  As sacred to their pleasures.  Here doth run
‚Ä≠  The large and cover‚Äôd den, where thou hast done
‚Ä≠  Hundreds of off‚Äôrings to the Naiades,
‚Ä≠  Here Mount Neritus shakes his curl√©d tress
‚Ä≠  Of shady woods.‚Äù  This said, she clear‚Äôd the cloud
‚Ä≠  That first deceiv‚Äôd his eyes; and all things show‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His country to him.  Glad he stood with sight
‚Ä≠  Of his lov‚Äôd soil, and kiss‚Äôd it with delight;
‚Ä≠  And instantly to all the Nymphs he paid
‚Ä≠  (With hands held up to heav‚Äôn) these vows, and said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúYe Nymphs the Naiades, great Seed of Jove,
‚Ä≠  I had conceit that never more should move
‚Ä≠  Your sight in these spheres of my erring eyes,
‚Ä≠  And therefore, in the fuller sacrifice
‚Ä≠  Of my heart‚Äôs gratitude, rejoice, till more
‚Ä≠  I pay your names in off‚Äôrings as before;
‚Ä≠  Which here I vow, if Jove‚Äôs benign descent,
‚Ä≠  The mighty Pillager, with life convent
‚Ä≠  My person home, and to my sav‚Äôd decease
‚Ä≠  Of my lov‚Äôd son‚Äôs sight add the sweet increase.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúBe confident,‚Äù  said Pallas,  ‚Äúnor oppress
‚Ä≠  Thy spirits with care of these performances,
‚Ä≠  But these thy fortunes let us straight repose
‚Ä≠  In this divine cave‚Äôs bosom, that may close
‚Ä≠  Reserve their value; and we then may see
‚Ä≠  How best to order other acts to thee.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus enter‚Äôd she the light-excluding cave,
‚Ä≠  And through it sought some inmost nook to save
‚Ä≠  The gold, the great brass, and robes richly-wrought,
‚Ä≠  Giv‚Äôn to Ulysses.  All which in he brought,
‚Ä≠  Laid down in heap; and she impos‚Äôd a stone
‚Ä≠  Close to the cavern‚Äôs mouth.  Then sat they on
‚Ä≠  The sacred olive‚Äôs root, consulting how
‚Ä≠  To act th‚Äô insulting Wooers‚Äô overthrow;
‚Ä≠  When Pallas said:  ‚ÄúExamine now the means
‚Ä≠  That best may lay hands on the impudence
‚Ä≠  Of those proud Wooers, that have now three years
‚Ä≠  Thy roof‚Äôs rule sway‚Äôd, and been bold offerers
‚Ä≠  Of suit and gifts to thy renown√©d wife,
‚Ä≠  Who for thy absence all her desolate life
‚Ä≠  Dissolves in tears till thy desir‚Äôd return;
‚Ä≠  Yet all her Wooers, while she thus doth mourn,
‚Ä≠  She holds in hope, and ev‚Äôry one affords
‚Ä≠  (In fore-sent message) promise; but her words
‚Ä≠  Bear other utt‚Äôrance than her heart approves.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO Gods,‚Äù  said Ithacus,  ‚Äúit now behoves
‚Ä≠  My fate to end me in the ill decease
‚Ä≠  That Agamemnon underwent, unless
‚Ä≠  You tell me, and in time; their close intents.
‚Ä≠  Advise then means to the reveng‚Äôd events
‚Ä≠  We both resolve on.  Be thyself so kind
‚Ä≠  To stand close to me, and but such a mind
‚Ä≠  Breathe in my bosom, as when th‚Äô Ilion tow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  We tore in cinders.  O if equal pow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  Thou wouldst enflame amidst my nerves as then,
‚Ä≠  I could encounter with three hundred men,
‚Ä≠  Thy only self, great Goddess, had to friend,
‚Ä≠  In those brave ardors thou wert wont t‚Äô extend!‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI will be strongly with thee,‚Äù  answer‚Äôd she,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúNor must thou fail, but do thy part with me.
‚Ä≠  When both whose pow‚Äôrs combine, I hope the bloods
‚Ä≠  And brains of some of these that waste thy goods
‚Ä≠  Shall strew thy goodly pavements.  Join we then:
‚Ä≠  I first will render thee unknown to men,
‚Ä≠  And on thy solid lineaments make dry
‚Ä≠  Thy now smooth skin; thy bright-brown curls imply
‚Ä≠  In hoary mattings; thy broad shoulders clothe
‚Ä≠  In such a cloak as ev‚Äôry eye shall lothe;
‚Ä≠  Thy bright eyes blear and wrinkle; and so change
‚Ä≠  Thy form at all parts, that thou shalt be strange
‚Ä≠  To all the Wooers, thy young son, and wife.
‚Ä≠  But to thy herdsman first present thy life,
‚Ä≠  That guards thy swine, and wisheth well to thee,
‚Ä≠  That loves thy son and wife Penelop√©.
‚Ä≠  Thy search shall find him set aside his herd,
‚Ä≠  That are with taste-delighting acorns rear‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And drink the dark-deep water of the spring,
‚Ä≠  Bright Arethusa, the most nourishing
‚Ä≠  Raiser of herds.  There stay, and, taking seat
‚Ä≠  Aside thy herdsman, of the whole state treat
‚Ä≠  Of home-occurrents, while I make access
‚Ä≠  To fair-dame-breeding Sparta for regress
‚Ä≠  Of lov‚Äôd Telemachus, who went in quest
‚Ä≠  Of thy lov‚Äôd fame, and liv‚Äôd the welcome guest
‚Ä≠  Of Menelaus.‚Äù  The much-knower said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúWhy wouldst not thou, in whose grave breast is bred
‚Ä≠  The art to order all acts, tell in this
‚Ä≠  His error to him?  Let those years of his
‚Ä≠  Amids the rude seas wander, and sustain
‚Ä≠  The woes there raging, while unworthy men
‚Ä≠  Devour his fortunes?‚Äù  ‚ÄúLet not care extend
‚Ä≠  Thy heart for him,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúmyself did send
‚Ä≠  His person in thy search; to set his worth,
‚Ä≠  By good fame blown, to such a distance forth.
‚Ä≠  Nor suffers he in any least degree
‚Ä≠  The grief you fear, but all variety
‚Ä≠  That Plenty can yield in her quiet‚Äôst fare,
‚Ä≠  In Menelaus‚Äô court, doth sit and share.
‚Ä≠  In whose return from home, the Wooers yet
‚Ä≠  Lay bloody ambush, and a ship have set
‚Ä≠  To sea, to intercept his life before
‚Ä≠  He touch again his birth‚Äôs attempted shore.
‚Ä≠  All which, my thoughts say, they shall never do,
‚Ä≠  But rather, that the earth shall overgo
‚Ä≠  Some one at least of these love-making men,
‚Ä≠  By which thy goods so much impair sustain.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Thus using certain secret words to him,
‚Ä≠  She touch‚Äôd him with her rod; and ev‚Äôry limb
‚Ä≠  Was hid all-over with a wither‚Äôd skin;
‚Ä≠  His bright eyes blear‚Äôd; his brow-curls white and thin;
‚Ä≠  And all things did an ag√©d man present.
‚Ä≠  Then, for his own weeds, shirt and coat, all-rent,
‚Ä≠  Tann‚Äôd, and all-sooti√©d with noisome smoke,
‚Ä≠  She put him on; and, over all, a cloke
‚Ä≠  Made of a stag‚Äôs huge hide, of which was worn
‚Ä≠  The hair quite off; a scrip, all-patch‚Äôd and torn,
‚Ä≠  Hung by a cord, oft broke and knit again;
‚Ä≠  And with a staff did his old limbs sustain.
‚Ä≠  Thus having both consulted of th‚Äô event,
‚Ä≠  They parted both; and forth to Sparta went
‚Ä≠  The gray-eyed Goddess, to see all things done
‚Ä≠  That appertain‚Äôd to wise Ulysses‚Äô son.

‚Ä≠  THE FOURTEENTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Ulysses meets amids the field
‚Ä≠  His swain Eum√¶us:  who doth yield
‚Ä≠  Kind guest-rites to him, and relate
‚Ä≠  Occurrents of his wrong‚Äôd estate.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _ŒûŒπÃë._
‚Ä≠     Ulysses fains
‚Ä≠        For his true good:
‚Ä≠     His pious swain‚Äôs
‚Ä≠        Faith understood.

‚Ä≠  But he the rough way took from forth the port,
‚Ä≠  Through woods and hill-tops, seeking the resort
‚Ä≠  Where Pallas said divine Eum√¶us liv‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  Who of the fortunes, that were first achiev‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By God-like Ithacus in household rights,
‚Ä≠  Had more true care than all his prosylites.  [1]
‚Ä≠  He found him sitting in his cottage door,
‚Ä≠  Where he had rais‚Äôd to ev‚Äôry airy blore
‚Ä≠  A front of great height, and in such a place
‚Ä≠  That round ye might behold, of circular grace
‚Ä≠  A walk so wound about it; which the swain
‚Ä≠  (In absence of his far-gone sovereign)
‚Ä≠  Had built himself, without his queen‚Äôs supply,
‚Ä≠  Or old Laertes‚Äô, to see safely lie
‚Ä≠  His hous√©d herd.  The inner part he wrought
‚Ä≠  Of stones, that thither his own labours brought,
‚Ä≠  Which with an hedge of thorn he fenc‚Äôd about,
‚Ä≠  And compass‚Äôd all the hedge with pales cleft out
‚Ä≠  Of sable oak, that here and there he fix‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Frequent and thick.  Within his yard he mix‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Twelve styes to lodge his herd; and ev‚Äôry stye
‚Ä≠  Had room and use for fifty swine to lie;
‚Ä≠  But those were females all.  The male swine slept
‚Ä≠  Without doors ever; nor was their herd kept
‚Ä≠  Fair like the females, since they suffer‚Äôd still
‚Ä≠  Great diminution, he being forc‚Äôd to kill
‚Ä≠  And send the fattest to the dainty feasts
‚Ä≠  Affected by th‚Äô ungodly wooing guests.
‚Ä≠  Their number therefore but three hundred were
‚Ä≠  And sixty.  By them mastiffs, as austere
‚Ä≠  As savage beasts, lay ever, their fierce strain
‚Ä≠  Bred by the herdsman, a mere prince of men,
‚Ä≠  Their number four.  Himself was then applied
‚Ä≠  In cutting forth a fair-hued ox‚Äôs hide,
‚Ä≠  To fit his feet with shoes.  His servants held
‚Ä≠  Guard of his swine:  three, here and there, at field,
‚Ä≠  The fourth he sent to city with a sow,
‚Ä≠  Which must of force be offer‚Äôd to the vow
‚Ä≠  The Wooers made to all satiety,
‚Ä≠  To serve which still they did those off‚Äôrings ply.
‚Ä≠  The fate-born-dogs-to-bark took sudden view  [2]
‚Ä≠  Of Odyss√´us, and upon him flew
‚Ä≠  With open mouth.  He, cunning to appall
‚Ä≠  A fierce dog‚Äôs fury, from his hand let fall
‚Ä≠  His staff to earth, and sat him careless down.
‚Ä≠  And yet to him had one foul wrong been shown
‚Ä≠  Where most his right lay, had not instantly
‚Ä≠  The herdsman let his hide fall, and his cry
‚Ä≠  (With frequent stones flung at the dogs) repell‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  This way and that their eager course they held;
‚Ä≠  When through the entry past, he thus did mourn:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO father!  How soon had you near been torn
‚Ä≠  By these rude dogs, whose hurt had branded me
‚Ä≠  With much neglect of you!  But Deity
‚Ä≠  Hath giv‚Äôn so many other sighs and cares
‚Ä≠  To my attendant state, that well unwares
‚Ä≠  You might be hurt for me, for here I lie
‚Ä≠  Grieving and mourning for the Majesty
‚Ä≠  That, God-like, wonted to be ruling here,
‚Ä≠  Since now I fat his swine for others‚Äô cheer,
‚Ä≠  Where he, perhaps, errs hungry up and down,
‚Ä≠  In countries, nations, cities, all unknown;
‚Ä≠  If any where he lives yet, and doth see
‚Ä≠  The sun‚Äôs sweet beams.  But, father, follow me,
‚Ä≠  That, cheer‚Äôd with wine and food, you may disclose
‚Ä≠  From whence you truly are, and all the woes
‚Ä≠  Your age is subject to.‚Äù  This said, he led
‚Ä≠  Into his cottage, and of osiers spread
‚Ä≠  A thicken‚Äôd hurdle, on whose top he strow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A wild-goat‚Äôs shaggy skin, and then bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His own couch on it, that was soft and great.
‚Ä≠     Ulysses joy‚Äôd to see him so entreat
‚Ä≠  His uncouth presence, saying:  ‚ÄúJove requite,
‚Ä≠  And all th‚Äô immortal Gods, with that delight
‚Ä≠  Thou most desir‚Äôst, thy kind receipt of me,
‚Ä≠  friend to human hospitality!‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Eum√¶us answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúGuest!  If one much worse
‚Ä≠  Arriv‚Äôd here than thyself, it were a curse
‚Ä≠  To my poor means, to let a stranger taste
‚Ä≠  Contempt for fit food.  Poor men, and unplac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In free seats of their own, are all from Jove
‚Ä≠  Commended to our entertaining love.
‚Ä≠  But poor is th‚Äô entertainment I can give,
‚Ä≠  Yet free and loving.  Of such men as live
‚Ä≠  The lives of servants, and are still in fear
‚Ä≠  Where young lords govern, this is all the cheer
‚Ä≠  They can afford a stranger.  There was one
‚Ä≠  That us‚Äôd to manage this now desert throne,
‚Ä≠  To whom the Gods deny return, that show‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His curious favour to me, and bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Possessions on me, a most-wish√©d wife,
‚Ä≠  A house, and portion, and a servant‚Äôs life,
‚Ä≠  Fit for the gift a gracious king should give;
‚Ä≠  Who still took pains himself, and God made thrive
‚Ä≠  His personal endeavour, and to me
‚Ä≠  His work the more increas‚Äôd, in which you see
‚Ä≠  I now am conversant.  And therefore much
‚Ä≠  His hand had help‚Äôd me, had Heav‚Äôn‚Äôs will been such,
‚Ä≠  He might have here grown old.  But he is gone,
‚Ä≠  And would to God the whole successi√≥n
‚Ä≠  Of Helen might go with him, since for her
‚Ä≠  So many men died, whose fate did confer
‚Ä≠  My liege to Troy, in Agamemnon‚Äôs grace,
‚Ä≠  To spoil her people, and her turrets race!‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, his coat to him he straight did gird,
‚Ä≠  And to his styes went that contain‚Äôd his herd;
‚Ä≠  From whence he took out two, slew both, and cut
‚Ä≠  Both fairly up; a fire enflam‚Äôd, and put
‚Ä≠  To spit the joints; which roasted well, he set
‚Ä≠  With spit and all to him, that he might eat
‚Ä≠  From thence his food in all the singeing heat,
‚Ä≠  Yet dredg‚Äôd it first with flour; then fill‚Äôd his cup
‚Ä≠  With good sweet wine; sat then, and cheer‚Äôd him up
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúEat now, my guest, such lean swine as are meat
‚Ä≠  For us poor swains; the fat the Wooers eat,
‚Ä≠  In whose minds no shame, no remorse, doth move,
‚Ä≠  Though well they know the bless‚Äôd Gods do not love
‚Ä≠  Ungodly actions, but respect the right,
‚Ä≠  And in the works of pious men delight.
‚Ä≠  But these are worse than impious, for those
‚Ä≠  That vow t‚Äô injustice, and profess them foes
‚Ä≠  To other nations, enter on their land,
‚Ä≠  And Jupiter (to show his punishing hand
‚Ä≠  Upon th‚Äô invaded, for their penance then)
‚Ä≠  Gives favour to their foes, though wicked men,
‚Ä≠  To make their prey on them; who, having freight
‚Ä≠  Their ships with spoil enough, weigh anchor straight,
‚Ä≠  And each man to his house; (and yet ev‚Äôn these,
‚Ä≠  Doth pow‚Äôrful fear of God‚Äôs just vengeance seize
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn for that prize in which they so rejoice)
‚Ä≠  But these men, knowing (having heard the voice
‚Ä≠  Of God by some means) that sad death hath reft
‚Ä≠  The ruler here, will never suffer left
‚Ä≠  Their unjust wooing of his wife, nor take
‚Ä≠  Her often answer, and their own roofs make
‚Ä≠  Their fit retreats, but (since uncheck‚Äôd they may)
‚Ä≠  They therefore will make still his goods their prey,
‚Ä≠  Without all spare or end.  There is no day,
‚Ä≠  Nor night, sent out from God, that ever they
‚Ä≠  Profane with one beast‚Äôs blood, or only two,
‚Ä≠  But more make spoil of; and the wrongs they do
‚Ä≠  In meat‚Äôs excess to wine as well extend,
‚Ä≠  Which as excessively their riots spend,
‚Ä≠  Yet still leave store, for sure his means were great,
‚Ä≠  And no hero√´, that hath choicest seat
‚Ä≠  Upon the fruitful neighbour-continent,
‚Ä≠  Or in this isle itself, so opulent
‚Ä≠  Was as Ulysses; no, nor twenty such,
‚Ä≠  Put altogether, did possess so much.
‚Ä≠     Whose herds and flocks I‚Äôll tell to ev‚Äôry head:
‚Ä≠  Upon the continent he daily fed
‚Ä≠  Twelve herds of oxen, no less flocks of sheep,
‚Ä≠  As many herds of swine, stalls large and steep,
‚Ä≠  And equal sorts of goats, which tenants there,
‚Ä≠  And his own shepherds, kept.  Then fed he here
‚Ä≠  Eleven fair stalls of goats, whose food hath yield
‚Ä≠  In the extreme part of a neighbour-field.
‚Ä≠  Each stall his herdsman hath, an honest swain,
‚Ä≠  Yet ev‚Äôry one must ev‚Äôry day sustain
‚Ä≠  The load of one beast (the most-fat, and best
‚Ä≠  Of all the stall-fed) to the Wooers‚Äô feast.
‚Ä≠  And I, for my part, of the swine I keep
‚Ä≠  (With four more herdsmen) ev‚Äôry day help steep
‚Ä≠  The Wooers‚Äô appetites in blood of one,
‚Ä≠  The most select our choice can fall upon.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     To this Ulysses gave good ear, and fed,
‚Ä≠  And drunk his wine, and vex‚Äôd, and ravish√©d
‚Ä≠  His food for mere vexation.  Seeds of ill
‚Ä≠  His stomach sow‚Äôd, to hear his goods go still
‚Ä≠  To glut of Wooers.  But his dinner done,
‚Ä≠  And stomach fed to satisfacti√≥n,
‚Ä≠  He drunk a full bowl, all of only wine,
‚Ä≠  And gave it to the guardian of his swine,
‚Ä≠  Who took it, and rejoic‚Äôd; to whom he said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO friend, who is it that, so rich, hath paid
‚Ä≠  Price for thy service, whose commended pow‚Äôr,
‚Ä≠  Thou sayst, to grace the Grecian conquerour,
‚Ä≠  At Ilion perish‚Äôd?  Tell me.  It may fall
‚Ä≠  I knew some such.  The great God knows, and all
‚Ä≠  The other deathless Godheads, if I can,
‚Ä≠  Far having travell‚Äôd, tell of such a man.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Eum√¶us answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúFather, never one,
‚Ä≠  Of all the strangers that have touch‚Äôd upon
‚Ä≠  This coast, with his life‚Äôs news could ever yet
‚Ä≠  Of queen, or lov‚Äôd son, any credit get.
‚Ä≠  These travellers, for clothes, or for a meal,
‚Ä≠  At all adventures, any lie will tell.
‚Ä≠  Nor do they trade for truth.  Not any man
‚Ä≠  That saw the people Ithacensian,
‚Ä≠  Of all their sort, and had the queen‚Äôs supplies,
‚Ä≠  Did ever tell her any news, but lies.
‚Ä≠  She graciously receives them yet, inquires
‚Ä≠  Of all she can, and all in tears expires.
‚Ä≠  It is th‚Äô accustom‚Äôd law, that women keep,
‚Ä≠  Their husbands elsewhere dead, at home to weep.
‚Ä≠  But do thou quickly, father, forge a tale,
‚Ä≠  Some coat, or cloak, to keep thee warm withal,
‚Ä≠  Perhaps some one may yield thee; but for him,
‚Ä≠  Vultures and dogs have torn from ev‚Äôry limb
‚Ä≠  His porous skin, and forth his soul is fled,
‚Ä≠  His corse at sea to fishes forfeited,
‚Ä≠  Or on the shore lies hid in heaps of sand,
‚Ä≠  And there hath he his ebb, his native strand
‚Ä≠  With friends‚Äô tears flowing.  But to me past all
‚Ä≠  Were tears created, for I never shall
‚Ä≠  Find so humane a royal master more,
‚Ä≠  Whatever sea I seek, whatever shore.
‚Ä≠  Nay, to my father, or my mother‚Äôs love
‚Ä≠  Should I return, by whom I breathe and move,
‚Ä≠  Could I so much joy offer; nor these eyes
‚Ä≠  (Though my desires sustain extremities
‚Ä≠  For their sad absence) would so fain be blest
‚Ä≠  With sight of their lives, in my native nest,
‚Ä≠  As with Ulysses dead; in whose last rest,
‚Ä≠  O friend, my soul shall love him.  He‚Äôs not here
‚Ä≠  Nor do I name him like a flatterer,
‚Ä≠  But as one thankful for his love and care
‚Ä≠  To me a poor man; in the rich so rare.
‚Ä≠  And be he past all shores where sun can shine,
‚Ä≠  I will invoke him as a soul divine.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO friend,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúto say, and to believe,
‚Ä≠  He cannot live, doth too much licence give
‚Ä≠  To incredulity; for, not to speak
‚Ä≠  At needy randon, but my breath to break
‚Ä≠  In sacred oath, Ulysses shall return.
‚Ä≠  And when his sight recomforts those that mourn
‚Ä≠  In his own roofs, then give me cloak, and coat,
‚Ä≠  And garments worthy of a man of note.
‚Ä≠  Before which, though need urg‚Äôd me never so,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll not receive a thread, but naked go.
‚Ä≠  No less I hate him than the gates of hell,
‚Ä≠  That poorness can force an untruth to tell.
‚Ä≠  Let Jove then (Heav‚Äôn‚Äôs chief God) just witness bear,
‚Ä≠  And this thy hospitable table here,
‚Ä≠  Together with unblam‚Äôd Ulysses‚Äô house,
‚Ä≠  In which I find receipt so gracious,
‚Ä≠  What I affirm‚Äôd of him shall all be true.
‚Ä≠  This instant year thine eyes ev‚Äôn here shall view
‚Ä≠  Thy lord Ulysses.  Nay, ere this month‚Äôs end,
‚Ä≠  Return‚Äôd full-home, he shall revenge extend
‚Ä≠  To ev‚Äôry one, whose ever deed hath done
‚Ä≠  Wrong to his wife and his illustrious son.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO father,‚Äù  he replied,  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll neither give
‚Ä≠  Thy news reward, nor doth Ulysses live.
‚Ä≠  But come, enough of this, let‚Äôs drink and eat,
‚Ä≠  And never more his memory repeat.
‚Ä≠  It grieves my heart to be remember‚Äôd thus
‚Ä≠  By anyone of one so glorious.
‚Ä≠  But stand your oath in your assertion strong,
‚Ä≠  And let Ulysses come, for whom I long,
‚Ä≠  For whom his wife, for whom his ag√©d sire,
‚Ä≠  For whom his son consumes his god-like fire,
‚Ä≠  Whose chance I now must mourn, and ever shall.
‚Ä≠  Whom when the Gods had brought to be as tall
‚Ä≠  As any upright plant, and I had said,
‚Ä≠  He would amongst a court of men have sway‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In counsels, and for form have been admir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn with his father, some God misinspir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Or man took from him his own equal mind,
‚Ä≠  And pass‚Äôd him for the Pylian shore to find
‚Ä≠  His long-lost father.  In return from whence,
‚Ä≠  The Wooers‚Äô pride way-lays his innocence,
‚Ä≠  That of divine Arcesius all the race
‚Ä≠  May fade to Ithaca, and not the grace
‚Ä≠  Of any name left to it.  But leave we
‚Ä≠  His state, however, if surpris‚Äôd he be,
‚Ä≠  Or if he scape.  And may Saturnius‚Äô hand
‚Ä≠  Protect him safely to his native land.
‚Ä≠  Do thou then, father, show your griefs, and cause
‚Ä≠  Of your arrival here; nor break the laws
‚Ä≠  That truth prescribes you, but relate your name,
‚Ä≠  And of what race you are, your father‚Äôs fame,
‚Ä≠  And native city‚Äôs; ship and men unfold,
‚Ä≠  That to this isle convey‚Äôd you, since I hold
‚Ä≠  Your here arrival was not all by shore,
‚Ä≠  Nor that your feet your ag√©d person bore.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd him:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell all strictly true,
‚Ä≠  If time, and food, and wine enough, accrue
‚Ä≠  Within your roof to us, that freely we
‚Ä≠  May sit and banquet.  Let your business be
‚Ä≠  Discharg‚Äôd by others; for, when all is done,
‚Ä≠  I cannot easily, while the year doth run
‚Ä≠  His circle round, run over all the woes,
‚Ä≠  Beneath which, by the course the Gods dispose,
‚Ä≠  My sad age labours.  First, I‚Äôll tell you then,
‚Ä≠  From ample Crete I fetch my native strain;
‚Ä≠  My father wealthy, whose house many a life
‚Ä≠  Brought forth and bred besides by his true wife,
‚Ä≠  But me a bond-maid bore, his concubine.
‚Ä≠  Yet tender‚Äôd was I as his lawful line
‚Ä≠  By him of whose race I my life profess.
‚Ä≠  Castor his name, surnam‚Äôd Hylacides.
‚Ä≠  A man, in fore-times, by the Cretan state,
‚Ä≠  For goods, good children, and his fortunate
‚Ä≠  Success in all acts, of no mean esteem.
‚Ä≠  But death-conferring Fates have banish‚Äôd him
‚Ä≠  To Pluto‚Äôs kingdom.  After whom, his sons
‚Ä≠  By lots divided his possessions,
‚Ä≠  And gave me passing little; yet bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A house on me, to which my virtues woo‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A wife from rich men‚Äôs roofs; nor was borne low,
‚Ä≠  Nor last in fight, though all nerves fail me now.
‚Ä≠  But I suppose, that you, by thus much seen,
‚Ä≠  Know by the stubble what the corn hath been.
‚Ä≠  For, past all doubt, affliction past all mean
‚Ä≠  Hath brought my age on; but, in seasons past,
‚Ä≠  Both Mars and Pallas have with boldness grac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And fortitude, my fortunes, when I chus‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Choice men for ambush, prest to have produc‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Ill to mine enemies; my too vent‚Äôrous spirit
‚Ä≠  Set never death before mine eyes, for merit,
‚Ä≠  But, far the first advanc‚Äôd still, still I strook
‚Ä≠  Dead with my lance whoever overtook
‚Ä≠  My speed of foot.  Such was I then for war.
‚Ä≠  But rustic actions ever fled me far,
‚Ä≠  And household thrift, which breeds a famous race.
‚Ä≠  In oar-driv‚Äôn ships did I my pleasures place,
‚Ä≠  In battles, light darts, arrows.  Sad things all,
‚Ä≠  And into others‚Äô thoughts with horror fall.
‚Ä≠     But what God put into my mind, to me
‚Ä≠  I still esteem‚Äôd as my felicity.
‚Ä≠  As men of sev‚Äôral metals are address‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  So sev‚Äôral forms are in their souls impress‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     Before the sons of Greece set foot in Troy,
‚Ä≠  Nine times, in chief, I did command enjoy
‚Ä≠  Of men and ships against our foreign foe,
‚Ä≠  And all I fitly wish‚Äôd succeeded so.
‚Ä≠  Yet, after this, I much exploit achiev‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  When straight my house in all possessions thriv‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Yet, after that, I great and rev‚Äôrend grew
‚Ä≠  Amongst the Cretans, till the Thund‚Äôrer drew
‚Ä≠  Our forces out in his foe-Troy decrees;
‚Ä≠  A hateful service that dissolv‚Äôd the knees
‚Ä≠  Of many a soldier.  And to this was I,
‚Ä≠  And famous Idomen, enjoin‚Äôd t‚Äô apply
‚Ä≠  Our ships and pow‚Äôrs, Nor was there to be heard
‚Ä≠  One reason for denial, so preferr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Was the unreasonable people‚Äôs rumour.
‚Ä≠  Nine years we therefore fed the martial humour,
‚Ä≠  And in the tenth, de-peopling Priam‚Äôs town,
‚Ä≠  We sail‚Äôd for home.  But God had quickly blown
‚Ä≠  Our fleet in pieces; and to wretched me
‚Ä≠  The counsellor Jove did much mishap decree,
‚Ä≠  For, only one month, I had leave t‚Äô enjoy
‚Ä≠  My wife and children, and my goods t‚Äô employ.
‚Ä≠  But, after this, my mind for √Ügypt stood,
‚Ä≠  When nine fair ships I rigg‚Äôd forth for the flood,
‚Ä≠  Mann‚Äôd them with noble soldiers, all things fit
‚Ä≠  For such a voyage soon were won to it.
‚Ä≠  Yet six days after stay‚Äôd my friends in feast,
‚Ä≠  While I in banquets to the Gods addrest
‚Ä≠  Much sacred matter for their sacrifice.
‚Ä≠  The seventh, we boarded; and the Northern skies
‚Ä≠  Lent us a frank and passing prosp‚Äôrous gale,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòFore which we bore us free and easy sail
‚Ä≠  As we had back‚Äôd a full and frolic tide;
‚Ä≠  Nor felt one ship misfortune for her pride,
‚Ä≠  But safe we sat, our sailors and the wind
‚Ä≠  Consenting in our convoy.  When heav‚Äôn shin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In sacred radiance of the fifth fair day,
‚Ä≠  To sweetly-water‚Äôd Egypt reach‚Äôd our way,
‚Ä≠  And there we anchor‚Äôd; where I charg‚Äôd my men
‚Ä≠  To stay aboard, and watch.  Dismissing then
‚Ä≠  Some scouts to get the hill-tops, and discover,
‚Ä≠  They (to their own intemperance giv‚Äôn over).
‚Ä≠  Straight fell to forage the rich fields, and thence
‚Ä≠  Enforce both wives and infants, with th‚Äô expence
‚Ä≠  Of both their bloods.  When straight the rumour flew
‚Ä≠  Up to the city.  Which heard, up they drew
‚Ä≠  By day‚Äôs First break, and all the field was fill‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With foot and horse, whose arms did all things gild.
‚Ä≠  And then the lightning-loving Deity cast
‚Ä≠  A foul flight on my soldiers; nor stood fast
‚Ä≠  One man of all.  About whom mischief stood,
‚Ä≠  And with his stern steel drew in streams the blood
‚Ä≠  The greater part fed in their dissolute veins;
‚Ä≠  The rest were sav‚Äôd, and made enthrall√©d swains
‚Ä≠  To all the basest usages there bred.
‚Ä≠  And then, ev‚Äôn Jove himself supplied my head
‚Ä≠  With saving counsel; though I wish‚Äôd to die,
‚Ä≠  And there in Egypt with their slaughters lie,
‚Ä≠  So much grief seiz‚Äôd me, but Jove made me yield,
‚Ä≠  Dishelm my head, take from my neck my shield,
‚Ä≠  Hurl from my hand my lance, and to the troop
‚Ä≠  Of horse the king led instantly made up,
‚Ä≠  Embrace, and kiss his knees; whom pity won
‚Ä≠  To give me safety, and (to make me shun
‚Ä≠  The people‚Äôs outrage, that made in amain,
‚Ä≠  All jointly fir‚Äôd with thirst to see me slain)
‚Ä≠  He took me to his chariot, weeping, home,
‚Ä≠  Himself with fear of Jove‚Äôs wrath overcome,
‚Ä≠  Who yielding souls receives, and takes most ill
‚Ä≠  All such as well may save yet love to kill.
‚Ä≠  Seven years I sojourn‚Äôd here, and treasure gat
‚Ä≠  In good abundance of th‚Äô √Ügyptian state,
‚Ä≠  For all would give; but when th‚Äô eighth year began,
‚Ä≠  A knowing fellow (that would gnaw a man  [3]
‚Ä≠  Like to a vermin, with his hellish brain,
‚Ä≠  And many an honest soul ev‚Äôn quick had slain,
‚Ä≠  Whose name was Ph≈ìnix) close accosted me,
‚Ä≠  And with insinuations, such as he
‚Ä≠  Practis‚Äôd on others, my consent he gain‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To go into Ph≈ìnicia, where remain‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His house, and living.  And with him I liv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A c√≥mplete year; but when were all arriv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The months and days, and that the year again
‚Ä≠  Was turning round, and ev‚Äôry season‚Äôs reign
‚Ä≠  Renew‚Äôd upon us, we for Libya went,
‚Ä≠  When, still inventing crafts to circumvent,
‚Ä≠  He made pretext, that I should only go
‚Ä≠  And help convey his freight; but thought not so,
‚Ä≠  For his intent was to have sold me there,
‚Ä≠  And made good gain for finding me a year.
‚Ä≠  Yet him I follow‚Äôd, though suspecting this,
‚Ä≠  For, being aboard his ship, I must be his
‚Ä≠  Of strong necessity.  She ran the flood
‚Ä≠  (Driven with a northern gale, right free, and good)
‚Ä≠  Amids the full stream, full on Crete.  But then
‚Ä≠  Jove plotted death to him and all his men,
‚Ä≠  For (put off quite from Crete, and so far gone
‚Ä≠  That shore was lost, and we set eye on none,
‚Ä≠  But all show‚Äôd heav‚Äôn and sea) above our keel
‚Ä≠  Jove pointed right a cloud as black as hell,
‚Ä≠  Beneath which all the sea hid, and from whence
‚Ä≠  Jove thunder‚Äôd as his hand would never thence,
‚Ä≠  And thick into our ship he threw his flash;  [4]
‚Ä≠  That ‚Äôgainst a rock, or flat, her keel did dash
‚Ä≠  With headlong rapture.  Of the sulphur all
‚Ä≠  Her bulk did savour; and her men let fall
‚Ä≠  Amids the surges, on which all lay tost,
‚Ä≠  Like sea-gulls, round about her sides, and lost.
‚Ä≠  And so God took all home-return from them.
‚Ä≠  But Jove himself, though plung‚Äôd in that extreme,
‚Ä≠  Recover‚Äôd me by thrusting on my hand
‚Ä≠  The ship‚Äôs long mast.  And, that my life might stand
‚Ä≠  A little more up, I embrac‚Äôd it round;
‚Ä≠  And on the rude winds, that did ruins sound,
‚Ä≠  Nine days we hover‚Äôd.  In the tenth black night
‚Ä≠  A huge sea cast me on Thesprotia‚Äôs height,
‚Ä≠  Where the hero√´ Phidon, that was chief
‚Ä≠  Of all the Thesprots, gave my wrack relief,
‚Ä≠  Without the price of that redempti√≥n  [5]
‚Ä≠  That Ph≈ìnix fish‚Äôd for.  Where the king‚Äôs lov‚Äôd son
‚Ä≠  Came to me, took me by the hand, and led
‚Ä≠  Into his court my poor life, surfeited
‚Ä≠  With cold and labour; and because my wrack
‚Ä≠  Chanc‚Äôd on his father‚Äôs shore, he let not lack
‚Ä≠  My plight or coat, or cloak, or anything
‚Ä≠  Might cherish heat in me.  And here the king
‚Ä≠  Said, he receiv‚Äôd Ulysses as his guest,
‚Ä≠  Observ‚Äôd him friend-like, and his course addrest
‚Ä≠  Home to his country, showing there to me
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô goods, a very treasury
‚Ä≠  Of brass, and gold, and steel of curious frame.
‚Ä≠  And to the tenth succession of his name
‚Ä≠  He laid up wealth enough, to serve beside
‚Ä≠  In that king‚Äôs house, so hugely amplified
‚Ä≠  His treasure was.  But from his court the king
‚Ä≠  Affirm‚Äôd him shipp‚Äôd for the Dodonean spring,
‚Ä≠  To hear, from out the high-hair‚Äôd oak of Jove,
‚Ä≠  Counsel from him for means to his remove
‚Ä≠  To his lov‚Äôd country, whence so many a year
‚Ä≠  He had been absent; if he should appear
‚Ä≠  Disguis‚Äôd, or manifest; and further swore
‚Ä≠  In his mid court, at sacrifice, before
‚Ä≠  These very eyes, that he had ready there
‚Ä≠  Both ship and soldiers, to attend and bear
‚Ä≠  Him to his country.  But, before, it chanc‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  That a Thesprotian ship was to be launch‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  For the much-corn-renown‚Äôd Dulichian land,
‚Ä≠  In which the king gave to his men command
‚Ä≠  To take, and bring me under tender hand
‚Ä≠  To king Acastus.  But, in ill design
‚Ä≠  Of my poor life, did their desires combine,
‚Ä≠  So far forth, as might ever keep me under
‚Ä≠  In fortune‚Äôs hands, and tear my state in sunder.
‚Ä≠  And when the water-treader far away
‚Ä≠  Had left the land, then plotted they the day
‚Ä≠  Of my long servitude, and took from me
‚Ä≠  Both coat and cloak, and all things that might be
‚Ä≠  Grace in my habit, and in place put on
‚Ä≠  These tatter‚Äôd rags, which now you see upon
‚Ä≠  My wretched bosom.  When heav‚Äôn‚Äôs light took sea,  [6]
‚Ä≠  They fetch‚Äôd the field-works of fair Ithaca,
‚Ä≠  And in the arm‚Äôd ship, with a well-wreath‚Äôd cord,
‚Ä≠  They straitly bound me, and did all disboard
‚Ä≠  To shore to supper, in contentious rout.
‚Ä≠  Yet straight the Gods themselves took from about
‚Ä≠  My pressed limbs the bands, with equal ease,
‚Ä≠  And I, my head in rags wrapp‚Äôd, took the seas,
‚Ä≠  Descending by the smooth stern, using then
‚Ä≠  My hands for oars, and made from these bad men
‚Ä≠  Long way in little time.  At last, I fetch‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A goodly grove of oaks, whose shore I reach‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And cast me prostrate on it.  When they knew
‚Ä≠  My thus-made ‚Äòscape, about the shores they flew,
‚Ä≠  But, soon not finding, held it not their best
‚Ä≠  To seek me further, but return‚Äôd to rest
‚Ä≠  Aboard their vessel.  Me the Gods lodg‚Äôd close,
‚Ä≠  Conducting me into the safe repose
‚Ä≠  A good man‚Äôs stable yielded.  And thus Fate
‚Ä≠  This poor hour added to my living date.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO wretch of guests,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúthy tale hath stirr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  My mind to much ruth, both how thou hast err‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And suffer‚Äôd, hearing in such good parts shown.
‚Ä≠  But, what thy chang‚Äôd relation would make known
‚Ä≠  About Ulysses, I hold neither true,
‚Ä≠  Nor will believe.  And what need‚Äôst thou pursue
‚Ä≠  A lie so rashly, since he sure is so
‚Ä≠  As I conceive, for which my skill shall go?
‚Ä≠  The safe return my king lacks cannot be,
‚Ä≠  He is so envied of each Deity,
‚Ä≠  So clear, so cruelly.  For not in Troy
‚Ä≠  They gave him end, nor let his corpse enjoy
‚Ä≠  The hands of friends (which well they might have done,
‚Ä≠  He manag‚Äôd arms to such perfection,
‚Ä≠  And should have had his sepulchre, and all,
‚Ä≠  And all the Greeks to grace his funeral,
‚Ä≠  And this had giv‚Äôn a glory to his son
‚Ä≠  Through all times future) but his head is run
‚Ä≠  Unseen, unhonour‚Äôd, into Harpies‚Äô maws.
‚Ä≠  For my part, I‚Äôll not meddle with the cause,
‚Ä≠  I live a separate life amongst my swine,
‚Ä≠  Come at no town for any need of mine,
‚Ä≠  Unless the circularly-witted queen  [7]
‚Ä≠  (When any far-come guest is to be seen
‚Ä≠  That brings her news) commands me bring a brawn,
‚Ä≠  About which (all things being in question drawn,
‚Ä≠  That touch the king) they sit, and some are sad
‚Ä≠  For his long absence, some again are glad
‚Ä≠  To waste his goods unwreak‚Äôd, all talking still.
‚Ä≠  But, as for me, I nourish‚Äôd little will
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô inquire or question of him, since the man
‚Ä≠  That feign‚Äôd himself the fled √Ütolian,
‚Ä≠  For slaught‚Äôring one, through many regions stray‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  In my stall, as his diversory, stay‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Where well entreating him, he told me then,
‚Ä≠  Amongst the Cretans, with king Idomen,
‚Ä≠  He saw Ulysses at his ship‚Äôs repair,
‚Ä≠  That had been brush‚Äôd with the enrag√©d air;
‚Ä≠  And that in summer, or in autumn, sure,
‚Ä≠  With all his brave friends and rich furniture,
‚Ä≠  He would be here; and nothing so, nor so.
‚Ä≠  But thou, an old man, taught with so much woe
‚Ä≠  As thou hast suffer‚Äôd, to be season‚Äôd true,
‚Ä≠  And brought by his fate, do not here pursue
‚Ä≠  His gratulations with thy cunning lies,
‚Ä≠  Thou canst not soak so through my faculties
‚Ä≠  For I did never either honour thee
‚Ä≠  Or give thee love, to bring these tales to me,
‚Ä≠  But in my fear of hospitable Jove
‚Ä≠  Thou didst to this pass my affections move.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúYou stand exceeding much incredulous,‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Replied Ulysses,  ‚Äúto have witness‚Äôd thus
‚Ä≠  My word and oath, yet yield no trust at all.
‚Ä≠  But make me now a covenant here, and call
‚Ä≠  The dreadful Gods to witness, that take seat
‚Ä≠  In large Olympus:  If your king‚Äôs retreat
‚Ä≠  Prove made, ev‚Äôn hither, you shall furnish me
‚Ä≠  With cloak, and coat, and make my passage free
‚Ä≠  For lov‚Äôd Dulichius; if, as fits my vow,
‚Ä≠  Your king return not, let your servants throw
‚Ä≠  My old limbs headlong from some rock most high,
‚Ä≠  That other poor men may take fear to lie.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The herdsman, that had gifts in him divine,
‚Ä≠  Replied:  ‚ÄúO guest, how shall this fame of mine
‚Ä≠  And honest virtue, amongst men, remain
‚Ä≠  Now, and hereafter, without worthy stain,
‚Ä≠  If I, that led thee to my hovel here,
‚Ä≠  And made thee fitting hospitable cheer,
‚Ä≠  Should after kill thee, and thy lov√©d mind
‚Ä≠  Force from thy bones? Or how should stand inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With any faith my will t‚Äô importune Jove,
‚Ä≠  In any pray‚Äôr hereafter for his love?
‚Ä≠     Come, now ‚Äôtis supper‚Äôs hour, and instant haste
‚Ä≠  My men will make home, when our sweet repast
‚Ä≠  We‚Äôll taste together.‚Äù  This discourse they held
‚Ä≠  In mutual kind, when from a neighbour-field
‚Ä≠  His swine and swine-herds came, who in their cotes
‚Ä≠  Inclos‚Äôd their herds for sleep, which mighty throats
‚Ä≠  Laid out in ent‚Äôring.  Then the God-like swain
‚Ä≠  His men enjoin‚Äôd thus:  ‚ÄúBring me to be slain
‚Ä≠  A chief swine female, for my stranger guest,
‚Ä≠  When altogether we will take our feast,
‚Ä≠  Refreshing now our spirits, that all day take
‚Ä≠  Pains in our swine‚Äôs good, who may therefore make
‚Ä≠  For our pains with them all amends with one,
‚Ä≠  Since others eat our labours, and take none.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said, his sharp steel hew‚Äôd down wood, and they
‚Ä≠  A passing fat swine hal‚Äôd out of the sty,
‚Ä≠  Of five years old, which to the fire they put.
‚Ä≠  When first Eum√¶us from the front did cut
‚Ä≠  The sacred hair, and cast it in the fire,
‚Ä≠  Then pray‚Äôd to heav‚Äôn; for still before desire
‚Ä≠  Was serv‚Äôd with food, in their so rude abodes,
‚Ä≠  Not the poor swine-herd would forget the Gods,
‚Ä≠  Good souls they bore, how bad soever were
‚Ä≠  The habits that their bodies‚Äô parts did bear.
‚Ä≠  When all the deathless Deities besought,
‚Ä≠  That wise Ulysses might be safely brought
‚Ä≠  Home to his house; then with a log of oak
‚Ä≠  Left lying by, high lifting it, a stroke
‚Ä≠  He gave so deadly it made life expire.
‚Ä≠  Then cut the rest her throat, and all in fire
‚Ä≠  They hid and sing‚Äôd her, cut her up; and then,
‚Ä≠  The master took the office from the men,
‚Ä≠  Who on the altar did the parts impose
‚Ä≠  That serv‚Äôd for sacrifice; beginning close
‚Ä≠  About the belly, thorough which he went.
‚Ä≠  And (all the chief fat gath‚Äôring) gave it vent
‚Ä≠  (Part dredg‚Äôd with flour) into the sacred flame;
‚Ä≠  Then cut they up the joints, and roasted them,
‚Ä≠  Drew all from spit, and serv‚Äôd in dishes all.
‚Ä≠  Then rose Eum√¶us (who was general
‚Ä≠  In skill to guide each act his fit event)
‚Ä≠  And, all in seven parts cut, the first part went
‚Ä≠  To service of the Nymphs and Mercury,
‚Ä≠  To whose names he did rites of piety
‚Ä≠  In vows particular; and all the rest
‚Ä≠  He shar‚Äôd to ev‚Äôry one, but his lov‚Äôd guest
‚Ä≠  He grac‚Äôd with all the chine, and of that king,
‚Ä≠  To have his heart cheer‚Äôd, set up ev‚Äôry string.
‚Ä≠  Which he observing said:  ‚ÄúI would to Jove,
‚Ä≠  Eum√¶us, thou liv‚Äôdst in his worthy love
‚Ä≠  As great as mine, that giv‚Äôst to such a guest
‚Ä≠  As my poor self of all thy goods the best.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Eum√¶us answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúEat, unhappy wretch,
‚Ä≠  And to what here is at thy pleasure reach.
‚Ä≠  This I have, this thou want‚Äôst; thus God will give,
‚Ä≠  Thus take away, in us, and all that live.
‚Ä≠  To his will‚Äôs equal centre all things fall,
‚Ä≠  His mind he must have, for he can do all.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus having eat, and to his wine descended,
‚Ä≠  Before he serv‚Äôd his own thirst, he commended
‚Ä≠  The first use of it in fit sacrifice
‚Ä≠  (As of his meat) to all the Deities,
‚Ä≠  And to the city-racer‚Äôs hand applied
‚Ä≠  The second cup, whose place was next his side.
‚Ä≠  Mesauli√∫s did distribute the meat,
‚Ä≠  (To which charge was Eum√¶us solely set,
‚Ä≠  In absence of Ulysses, by the queen
‚Ä≠  And old Laertes) and this man had been
‚Ä≠  Bought by Eum√¶us, with his faculties,
‚Ä≠  Employ‚Äôd then in the Taphian merchandise.
‚Ä≠     But now, to food appos‚Äôd, and order‚Äôd thus,
‚Ä≠  All fell.  Desire suffic‚Äôd, Mesauli√∫s
‚Ä≠  Did take away.  For bed then next they were,
‚Ä≠  All thoroughly satisfied with c√≥mplete cheer.
‚Ä≠  The night then came, ill, and no taper shin‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  Jove rain‚Äôd her whole date; th‚Äô ever-wat‚Äôry wind
‚Ä≠  Zephyr blew loud; and Laertiades
‚Ä≠  (Approving kind Eum√¶us‚Äô carefulness
‚Ä≠  For his whole good) made far about assay,
‚Ä≠  To get some cast-off cassock (lest he lay
‚Ä≠  That rough night cold) of him, or anyone
‚Ä≠  Of those his servants; when he thus begun:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHear me, Eum√¶us, and my other friends,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll use a speech that to my glory tends,
‚Ä≠  Since I have drunk wine past my usual guise.
‚Ä≠  _Strong wine commands the fool and moves the wise,_
‚Ä≠  Moves and impels him too to sing and dance,
‚Ä≠  And break in pleasant laughters, and, perchance,
‚Ä≠  Prefer a speech too that were better in.
‚Ä≠  But when my spirits once to speak begin,
‚Ä≠  I shall not then dissemble.  Would to heav‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  I were as young, and had my forces driv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  As close together, as when once our pow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  We led to ambush under th‚Äô Ilion tow‚Äôrs!
‚Ä≠  Where Ithacus and Menelaus were
‚Ä≠  The two commanders, when it pleas‚Äôd them there
‚Ä≠  To take myself for third, when to the town
‚Ä≠  And lofty walls we led, we couch‚Äôd close down,
‚Ä≠  All arm‚Äôd, amids the osiers and the reeds,
‚Ä≠  Which oftentimes th‚Äô o‚Äôer-flowing river feeds.
‚Ä≠  The cold night came, and th‚Äô icy northern gale
‚Ä≠  Blew bleak upon us, after which did fall
‚Ä≠  A snow so cold, it cut as in it beat
‚Ä≠  A frozen water, which was all concrete
‚Ä≠  About our shields like crystal.  All made feign
‚Ä≠  Above our arms to clothe, and clothe again.
‚Ä≠  And so we made good shift, our shields beside
‚Ä≠  Clapp‚Äôd close upon our clothes, to rest and hide
‚Ä≠  From all discovery.  But I, poor fool,
‚Ä≠  Left my weeds with my men, because so cool
‚Ä≠  I thought it could not prove; which thought my pride
‚Ä≠  A little strengthen‚Äôd, being loth to hide
‚Ä≠  A goodly glitt‚Äôring garment I had on;
‚Ä≠  And so I follow‚Äôd with my shield alone,
‚Ä≠  And that brave weed. But when the night near ended
‚Ä≠  Her course on earth, and that the stars descended,
‚Ä≠  I jogg‚Äôd Ulysses, who lay passing near,
‚Ä≠  And spake to him, that had a nimble ear,
‚Ä≠  Assuring him, that long I could not lie
‚Ä≠  Amongst the living, for the fervency
‚Ä≠  Of that sharp night would kill me, since as then
‚Ä≠  My evil angel made me with my men
‚Ä≠  Leave all weeds but a fine one.  But I know
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTis vain to talk; here wants all remedy now.
‚Ä≠     This said, he bore that understanding part
‚Ä≠  In his prompt spirit that still show‚Äôd his art
‚Ä≠  In fight and counsel, saying (in a word,
‚Ä≠  And that low whisper‚Äôd) peace, lest you afford
‚Ä≠  Some Greek note of your softness.  No word more,
‚Ä≠  But made as if his stern austerity bore
‚Ä≠  My plight no pity; yet, as still he lay
‚Ä≠  His head reposing on his hand, gave way
‚Ä≠  To this invention:  ‚ÄòHear me friends, a dream
‚Ä≠  (That was of some celestial light a beam)
‚Ä≠  Stood in my sleep before me, prompting me
‚Ä≠  With this fit notice:   ‚ÄòWe are far,‚Äô  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòFrom out our fleet.  Let one go then, and try
‚Ä≠  If Agamemnon will afford supply
‚Ä≠  To what we now are strong.‚Äô  This stirr‚Äôd a speed
‚Ä≠  In Thoas to th‚Äô affair; whose purple weed
‚Ä≠  He left for haste; which then I took, and lay
‚Ä≠  In quiet after, till the dawn of day.
‚Ä≠     This shift Ulysses made for one in need,
‚Ä≠  And would to heav‚Äôn, that youth such spirit did feed
‚Ä≠  Now in my nerves, and that my joints were knit
‚Ä≠  With such a strength as made me then held fit
‚Ä≠  To lead men with Ulysses!  I should then
‚Ä≠  Seem worth a weed that fits a herdsman‚Äôs men,
‚Ä≠  For two respects, to gain a thankful friend,
‚Ä≠  And to a good man‚Äôs need a good extend.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO father,‚Äù  said Eum√¶us  ‚Äúthou hast shown
‚Ä≠  Good cause for us to give thee good renown,
‚Ä≠  Not using any word that was not freed
‚Ä≠  From all least ill.  Thou, therefore, shalt not need
‚Ä≠  Or coat, or other thing, that aptly may
‚Ä≠  Beseem a wretched suppliant for defray
‚Ä≠  Of this night‚Äôs need.  But, when her golden throne
‚Ä≠  The morn ascends, you must resume your own,
‚Ä≠  For here you must not dream of many weeds,
‚Ä≠  Or any change at all.  We serve our needs
‚Ä≠  As you do yours; one back, one coat.  But when
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô lov√©d son returns, he then
‚Ä≠  Shall give you coat and cassock, and bestow
‚Ä≠  Your person where your heart and soul is now,‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he rose, made near the fire his bed,
‚Ä≠  Which all with goats‚Äô and sheep skins he bespread.
‚Ä≠  All which Ulysses with himself did line,
‚Ä≠  With whom; besides, he chang‚Äôd a gaberdine,
‚Ä≠  Thick lin‚Äôd, and soft, which still he made his shift
‚Ä≠  When he would dress him ‚Äôgainst the horrid drift
‚Ä≠  Of tempest, when deep winter‚Äôs season blows.
‚Ä≠  Nor pleas‚Äôd it him to lie there with his sows,
‚Ä≠  But while Ulysses slept there, and close by
‚Ä≠  The other younkers, he abroad would lie,
‚Ä≠  And therefore arm‚Äôd him.  Which set cheerful fare
‚Ä≠  Before Ulysses‚Äô heart, to see such care
‚Ä≠  Of his goods taken, how far off soever
‚Ä≠  His fate his person and his wealth should sever.
‚Ä≠  First then, a sharp-edg‚Äôd sword he girt about
‚Ä≠  His well-spread shoulders, and (to shelter out
‚Ä≠  The sharp West wind that blew) he put him on
‚Ä≠  A thick-lin‚Äôd jacket, and yet cast upon
‚Ä≠  All that the large hide of a goat well-fed.
‚Ä≠  A lance then took he, with a keen steel head,
‚Ä≠  To be his keep-off both ‚Äôgainst men and dogs.
‚Ä≠  And thus went he to rest with his male hogs,
‚Ä≠  That still abroad lay underneath a rock,
‚Ä≠  Shield to the North wind‚Äôs ever-eager shock.

‚Ä≠  THE FIFTEENTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Minerva to his native seat.
‚Ä≠  Exhorts Ulysses‚Äô son‚Äôs retreat,
‚Ä≠  In bed, and waking.  He receives
‚Ä≠  Gifts of Atrides, and so leaves
‚Ä≠  The Spartan court.  And, going aboard,
‚Ä≠  Doth favourable way afford
‚Ä≠  To Theoclymenus, that was
‚Ä≠  The Argive augur, and sought pass,
‚Ä≠  Fled for a slaughter he had done.
‚Ä≠     Eum√¶us tells Laertes‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  How he became his father‚Äôs man,
‚Ä≠  Being sold by the Ph≈ìnician
‚Ä≠  For some agreed-on faculties,
‚Ä≠  From forth the Syrian isle made prise.
‚Ä≠     Telemachus, arrived at home,
‚Ä≠  Doth to Eum√¶us‚Äô cottage come.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  O.
‚Ä≠     From Sparta‚Äôs strand
‚Ä≠        Makes safe access
‚Ä≠     To his own land
‚Ä≠        Ulyssides.

‚Ä≠  In Laced√¶mon, large, and apt for dances,  [1]
‚Ä≠  Athenian Pallas her access advances
‚Ä≠  Up to the great-in-soul Ulysses‚Äô seed,
‚Ä≠  Suggesting his return now fit for deed.
‚Ä≠  She found both him and Nestor‚Äôs noble son
‚Ä≠  In bed, in front of that fair mansi√≥n,
‚Ä≠  Nestorides surpris‚Äôd with pleasing sleep,
‚Ä≠  But on the watch Ulysses‚Äô son did keep,
‚Ä≠  Sleep could not enter, cares did so excite
‚Ä≠  His soul, through all the solitary night,
‚Ä≠  For his lov‚Äôd father.  To him, near, she said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúTelemachus!  ‚ÄôTis time that now were stay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Thy foreign travels, since thy goods are free
‚Ä≠  For those proud men that all will eat from thee,
‚Ä≠  Divide thy whole possessi√≥ns, and leave
‚Ä≠  Thy too-late presence nothing to receive.
‚Ä≠  Incite the shrill-voic‚Äôd Menelaus then,
‚Ä≠  To send thee to thy native seat again,
‚Ä≠  While thou mayst yet find in her honour strong
‚Ä≠  Thy blameless mother, ‚Äôgainst thy fathers‚Äô wrong.
‚Ä≠  For both the father, and the brothers too,
‚Ä≠  Of thy lov‚Äôd mother, will not suffer so
‚Ä≠  Extended any more her widow‚Äôs bed,
‚Ä≠  But make her now her richest wooer wed,
‚Ä≠  Eurymachus, who chiefly may augment
‚Ä≠  Her gifts, and make her jointure eminent.
‚Ä≠  And therefore haste thee, lest, in thy despite,
‚Ä≠  Thy house stand empty of thy native right.
‚Ä≠  For well thou know‚Äôst what mind a woman bears;
‚Ä≠  The house of him, whoever she endears
‚Ä≠  Herself in nuptials to, she sees increas‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  The issue of her first lov‚Äôd lord deceas‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Forgotten quite, and never thought on more.
‚Ä≠  In thy return then, the re-counted store
‚Ä≠  Thou find‚Äôst reserv‚Äôd, to thy most trusted maid
‚Ä≠  Commit in guard, till Heav‚Äôn‚Äôs Pow‚Äôrs have purvey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A wife, in virtue and in beauty‚Äôs grace,
‚Ä≠  Of fit sort for thee, to supply her place.
‚Ä≠  And this note more I‚Äôll give thee, which repose
‚Ä≠  In sure remembrance: The best sort of those
‚Ä≠  That woo thy mother watchful scouts address
‚Ä≠  Both in the straits of th‚Äô Ithacensian seas,
‚Ä≠  And dusty Samos, with intent t‚Äô invade
‚Ä≠  And take thy life, ere thy return be made.
‚Ä≠  Which yet I think will fail, and some of them
‚Ä≠  That waste thy fortunes taste of that extreme
‚Ä≠  They plot for thee.  But keep off far from shore,
‚Ä≠  And day and night sail, for a fore-right blore,
‚Ä≠  Whoever of th‚Äô Immortals that vow guard
‚Ä≠  And ‚Äôscape to thy return, will see prepar‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  As soon as thou arriv‚Äôst, dismiss to town
‚Ä≠  Thy ship and men, and first of all make down
‚Ä≠  To him that keeps thy swine, and doth conceive
‚Ä≠  A tender care to see thee well survive.
‚Ä≠  There sleep; and send him to the town, to tell
‚Ä≠  The chaste Penelop√©, that safe and well
‚Ä≠  Thou liv‚Äôst in his charge, and that Pylos‚Äô sands
‚Ä≠  The place contain‚Äôd from whence thy person lands.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus she to large Olympus made ascent.
‚Ä≠  When with his heel a little touch he lent
‚Ä≠  To Nestor‚Äôs son, whose sleep‚Äôs sweet chains he loos‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Bad rise, and see in chariot inclos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Their one-hoof‚Äôd horse, that they might straight be gone.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúNo such haste,‚Äù  he replied,  ‚ÄúNight holds her throne,
‚Ä≠  And dims all way to course of chariot.
‚Ä≠  The morn will soon get up.  Nor see forgot
‚Ä≠  The gifts with haste, that will, I know, be rich,
‚Ä≠  And put into our coach with gracious speech
‚Ä≠  By lance-fam‚Äôd Menelaus.  Not a guest
‚Ä≠  Shall touch at his house, but shall store his breast
‚Ä≠  With fit mind of an hospitable man,
‚Ä≠  To last as long as any daylight can
‚Ä≠  His eyes recomfort, in such gifts as he
‚Ä≠  Will proofs make of his hearty royalty.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He had no sooner said, but up arose
‚Ä≠  Aurora, that the golden hills repose.
‚Ä≠  And Menelaus, good-at-martial-cries,
‚Ä≠  From Helen‚Äôs bed rais‚Äôd, to his guest applies
‚Ä≠  His first appearance.  Whose repair made known
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô Ulysses‚Äô lov‚Äôd son, on his robe was thrown
‚Ä≠  About his gracious body, his cloak cast
‚Ä≠  Athwart his ample shoulders, and in haste
‚Ä≠  Abroad he went, and did the king accost:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAtrides, guarded with heav‚Äôn‚Äôs deified host,
‚Ä≠  Grant now remission to my native right,
‚Ä≠  My mind now urging mine own house‚Äôs sight.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúNor will I stay,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúthy person long,
‚Ä≠  Since thy desires to go are grown so strong.
‚Ä≠  I should myself be angry to sustain
‚Ä≠  The like detention urg‚Äôd by other men.
‚Ä≠  Who loves a guest past mean, past mean will hate,
‚Ä≠  _The mean in all acts bears the best estate._
‚Ä≠  A like ill ‚Äôtis, to thrust out such a guest
‚Ä≠  As would not go, as to detain the rest.
‚Ä≠  We should a guest love, while he loves to stay,
‚Ä≠  And, when he likes not, give him loving way.
‚Ä≠  Yet suffer so, that we may gifts impose
‚Ä≠  In coach to thee; which ere our hands inclose,
‚Ä≠  Thine eyes shall see, lest else our loves may glose.
‚Ä≠  Besides, I‚Äôll cause our women to prepare
‚Ä≠  What our house yields, and merely so much fare
‚Ä≠  As may suffice for health.  Both well will do,
‚Ä≠  Both for our honour and our profit too.
‚Ä≠  And, serving strength with food, you after may
‚Ä≠  As much earth measure as will match the clay.
‚Ä≠  If you will turn your course from sea, and go
‚Ä≠  Through Greece and Argos (that myself may so
‚Ä≠  Keep kind way with thee) I‚Äôll join horse, and guide
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô our human cities.  Nor ungratified
‚Ä≠  Will anyone remit us; some one thing
‚Ä≠  Will each present us, that along may bring
‚Ä≠  Our pass with love, and prove our virtues blaz‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠  A caldron, or a tripod, richly-braz‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Two mules, a bowl of gold, that hath his price
‚Ä≠  Heighten‚Äôd with emblems of some rare device.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The wise prince answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúI would gladly go
‚Ä≠  Home to mine own, and see that govern‚Äôd so
‚Ä≠  That I may keep what I for certain hold,
‚Ä≠  Not hazard that for only hop‚Äôd-for gold.
‚Ä≠  I left behind me none so all ways fit
‚Ä≠  To give it guard, as mine own trust with it.
‚Ä≠  Besides, in this broad course which you propose,
‚Ä≠  My father seeking I myself may lose.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     When this the shrill-voic‚Äôd Menelaus heard,
‚Ä≠  He charg‚Äôd his queen and maids to see prepar‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Breakfast, of what the whole house held for best.
‚Ä≠  To him rose Eteoneus from his rest,
‚Ä≠  Whose dwelling was not far off from the court,
‚Ä≠  And his attendance his command did sort
‚Ä≠  With kindling fires, and furth‚Äôring all the roast,
‚Ä≠  In act of whose charge heard no time he lost.
‚Ä≠     Himself then to an odorous room descended,
‚Ä≠  Whom Megapenthe and his queen attended.
‚Ä≠  Come to his treasury, a two-ear‚Äôd cup
‚Ä≠  He choos‚Äôd of all, and made his son bear up
‚Ä≠  A silver bowl.  The queen then taking stand
‚Ä≠  Aside her chest, where by her own fair hand
‚Ä≠  Lay vests of all hues wrought, she took out one
‚Ä≠  Most large, most artful, chiefly fair, and shone
‚Ä≠  Like to a star, and lay of all the last.
‚Ä≠     Then through the house with either‚Äôs gift they past;
‚Ä≠  When to Ulysses‚Äô son Atrides said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúTelemachus, since so entirely sway‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Thy thoughts are with thy vow‚Äôd return now tender‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  May Juno‚Äôs thund‚Äôring husband see it render‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Perfect at all parts, action answ‚Äôring thought.
‚Ä≠  Of all the rich gifts, in my treasure sought,
‚Ä≠  I give thee here the most in grace and best.
‚Ä≠  A bowl but silver, yet the brim‚Äôs comprest
‚Ä≠  With gold, whose fabric his desert doth bring
‚Ä≠  From Vulcan‚Äôs hand, presented by the king
‚Ä≠  And great hero√´ of Sidonia‚Äôs state,
‚Ä≠  When at our parting he did consummate
‚Ä≠  His whole house-keeping.  This do thou command.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he put the round bowl in his hand,
‚Ä≠  And then his strong son Megapenthe plac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The silver cup before him, amply grac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With work and lustre.  Helen (standing by,
‚Ä≠  And in her hand the robe, her housewifery)
‚Ä≠  His name rememb‚Äôring, said:  ‚ÄúAnd I present,
‚Ä≠  Lov‚Äôd son, this gift to thee, the monument
‚Ä≠  Of the so-many-lov√©d Helen‚Äôs hands,
‚Ä≠  Which, at the knitting of thy nuptial bands,
‚Ä≠  Present thy wife.  In mean space, may it lie
‚Ä≠  By thy lov‚Äôd mother; but to me apply
‚Ä≠  Thy pleasure in it, and thus take thy way
‚Ä≠  To thy fair house, and country‚Äôs wish√©d stay.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Thus gave she to his hands the veil, and he
‚Ä≠  The acceptation author‚Äôd joyfully.
‚Ä≠  Which in the chariot‚Äôs chest Pisistratus
‚Ä≠  Plac‚Äôd with the rest, and held miraculous.
‚Ä≠     The yellow-headed king then led them all
‚Ä≠  To seats and thrones plac‚Äôd in his spacious hall.
‚Ä≠  The hand-maid water brought, and gave it stream
‚Ä≠  From out a fair and golden ewer to them,
‚Ä≠  From whose hands to a silver caldron fled
‚Ä≠  The troubled wave.  A bright board then she spread,
‚Ä≠  On which another rev‚Äôrend dame set bread.
‚Ä≠  To which more servants store of victuals serv‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Eteon√´us was the man that kerv‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And Megapenthe fill‚Äôd them all their wine.
‚Ä≠  All fed and drank, till all felt care decline
‚Ä≠  For those refreshings.  Both the guests did go
‚Ä≠  To horse, and coach, and forth the portico
‚Ä≠  A little issued, when the yellow King
‚Ä≠  Brought wine himself, that, with an offering
‚Ä≠  To all the Gods, they might their journey take.
‚Ä≠  He stood before the Gods, and thus he spake:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúFarewell young Princes!  To grave Nestor‚Äôs ear
‚Ä≠  This salutation from my gratitude bear:
‚Ä≠  That I profess, in all our Ilion wars,
‚Ä≠  He stood a careful father to my cares.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     To whom the wise Ulyssides replied:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúWith all our utmost shall be signified,
‚Ä≠  Jove-kept Atrides, your right royal will;
‚Ä≠  And would to God, I could as well fulfill
‚Ä≠  Mine own mind‚Äôs gratitude, for your free grace,
‚Ä≠  In telling to Ulysses, in the place
‚Ä≠  Of my return, in what accomplish‚Äôd kind
‚Ä≠  I have obtain‚Äôd the office of a friend
‚Ä≠  At your deservings; whose fair end you crown
‚Ä≠  With gifts so many, and of such renown!‚Äù
‚Ä≠     His wish, that he might find in his retreat
‚Ä≠  His father safe return‚Äôd (to so repeat
‚Ä≠  The king‚Äôs love to him) was saluted thus:
‚Ä≠  An eagle rose, and in her seres did truss
‚Ä≠  A goose, all-white, and huge, a household one,
‚Ä≠  Which men and women, crying out upon,
‚Ä≠  Pursued, but she, being near the guests, her flight
‚Ä≠  Made on their right hand, and kept still fore-right
‚Ä≠  Before their horses; which observ‚Äôd by them,
‚Ä≠  The spirits in all their minds took joys extreme,
‚Ä≠  Which Nestor‚Äôs son thus question‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúJove-kept king,  [2]
‚Ä≠  Yield your grave thoughts, if this ostentful thing
‚Ä≠  (This eagle, and this goose) touch us, or you?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He put to study, and not knowing how
‚Ä≠  To give fit answer, Helen took on her
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô ostent‚Äôs solution, and did this prefer:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHear me, and I will play the prophet‚Äôs part,
‚Ä≠  As the Immortals cast it in my heart,
‚Ä≠  And as, I think, will make the true sense known:
‚Ä≠  As this Jove‚Äôs bird, from out the mountains flown,
‚Ä≠  (Where was her eyrie, and whence rose her race,)
‚Ä≠  Truss‚Äôd up this goose, that from the house did graze,
‚Ä≠  So shall Ulysses, coming from the wild
‚Ä≠  Of seas and suff‚Äôrings, reach, unreconcil‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  His native home, where ev‚Äôn this hour he is,
‚Ä≠  And on those house-fed Wooers those wrongs of his
‚Ä≠  Will shortly wreak, with all their miseries.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO,‚Äù  said Telemachus,  ‚Äúif Saturnian Jove
‚Ä≠  To my desires thy dear presage approve,
‚Ä≠  When I arrive, I will perform to thee
‚Ä≠  My daily vows, as to a Deity.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he us‚Äôd his scourge upon the horse,
‚Ä≠  That through the city freely made their course
‚Ä≠  To field, and all day made that first speed good.
‚Ä≠  But when the sun set, and obscureness stood
‚Ä≠  In each man‚Äôs way, they ended their access
‚Ä≠  At Pheras, in the house of Diocles,
‚Ä≠  Son to Orsilochus, Alph√´us‚Äô seed,
‚Ä≠  Who gave them guest-rites; and sleep‚Äôs natural need
‚Ä≠  They that night served there.  When Aurora rose,
‚Ä≠  They join‚Äôd their horse, took coach, and did dispose
‚Ä≠  Their course for Pylos; whose high city soon
‚Ä≠  They reach‚Äôd.  Nor would Telemachus be won
‚Ä≠  To Nestor‚Äôs house, and therefore order‚Äôd thus
‚Ä≠  His speech to Nestor‚Äôs son, Pisistratus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHow shall I win thy promise to a grace
‚Ä≠  That I must ask of thee?  We both embrace
‚Ä≠  The names of bed-fellows, and in that name
‚Ä≠  Will glory as an adjunct of our fame;
‚Ä≠  Our fathers‚Äô friendship, our own equal age,
‚Ä≠  And our joint travel, may the more engage
‚Ä≠  Our mutual concord.  Do not then assay,
‚Ä≠  My God-lov‚Äôd friend, to lead me from my way
‚Ä≠  To my near ship, but take a course direct
‚Ä≠  And leave me there, lest thy old sire‚Äôs respect,
‚Ä≠  In his desire to love me, hinder so
‚Ä≠  My way for home, that have such need to go.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, Nestorides held all discourse
‚Ä≠  In his kind soul, how best he might enforce
‚Ä≠  Both promise and performance; which, at last;
‚Ä≠  He vow‚Äôd to venture, and directly cast
‚Ä≠  His horse about to fetch the ship and shore.
‚Ä≠  Where come, his friends‚Äô most lovely gifts he bore
‚Ä≠  Aboard the ship, and in her hind-deck plac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The veil that Helen‚Äôs curious hand had grac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And Menelaus‚Äô gold, and said:  ‚ÄúAway,
‚Ä≠  Nor let thy men, in any least date, stay,
‚Ä≠  But quite put off, ere I get home, and tell
‚Ä≠  The old duke, you are past; for passing well
‚Ä≠  I know his mind to so exceed all force
‚Ä≠  Of any pray‚Äôr, that he will stay your course,
‚Ä≠  Himself make hither, all your course call back,
‚Ä≠  And, when he hath you, have no thought to rack
‚Ä≠  Him from his bounty, and to let you part
‚Ä≠  Without a present, but be vex‚Äôd at heart
‚Ä≠  With both our pleadings, if we once put move
‚Ä≠  The least repression of his fiery love.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus took he coach, his fair-man‚Äôd steeds scourg‚Äôd on
‚Ä≠  Along the Pylian city, and anon
‚Ä≠  His father‚Äôs court reach‚Äôd; while Ulysses‚Äô son
‚Ä≠  Bade board, and arm; which with a thought was done.
‚Ä≠     His rowers set, and he rich odours firing
‚Ä≠  In his hind-deck, for his secure retiring,
‚Ä≠  To great Athenia, to his ship came flying
‚Ä≠  A stranger, and a prophet, as relying
‚Ä≠  On wish√©d passage, having newly slain
‚Ä≠  A man at Argos, yet his race‚Äôs vein
‚Ä≠  Flow‚Äôd from Melampus, who in former date
‚Ä≠  In Pylos liv‚Äôd, and had a huge estate,
‚Ä≠  But fled his country, and the punishing hand
‚Ä≠  Of great-soul‚Äôd Neleus, in a foreign land,
‚Ä≠  From that most famous mortal, having held
‚Ä≠  A world of riches, nor could be compell‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To render restitution in a year.
‚Ä≠  In mean space, living as close prisoner
‚Ä≠  In court of Phylacus, and for the sake
‚Ä≠  Of Neleus‚Äô daughter mighty cares did take,
‚Ä≠  Together with a grievous languor sent
‚Ä≠  From grave Erinnys, that did much torment
‚Ä≠  His vex√©d conscience; yet his life‚Äôs expence
‚Ä≠  He scap‚Äôd, and drave the loud-voiced oxen thence,
‚Ä≠  To breed-sheep Pylos, bringing vengeance thus
‚Ä≠  Her foul demerit to great Nele√ºs,
‚Ä≠  And to his brother‚Äôs house reduc‚Äôd his wife.
‚Ä≠  Who yet from Pylos did remove his life
‚Ä≠  For feed-horse Argos, where his fate set down
‚Ä≠  A dwelling for him, and in much renown
‚Ä≠  Made govern many Argives, where a spouse
‚Ä≠  He took to him, and built a famous house.
‚Ä≠  There had he born to him Antiphates,
‚Ä≠  And forceful Mantius.  To the first of these
‚Ä≠  Was great O√Øcleus born: O√Øcleus gat
‚Ä≠  Amphiaraus, that the popular state
‚Ä≠  Had all their health in, whom ev‚Äôn from his heart
‚Ä≠  Jove lov‚Äôd, and Ph≈ìbus in the whole desert
‚Ä≠  Of friendship held him; yet not bless‚Äôd so much
‚Ä≠  That age‚Äôs threshold he did ever touch,
‚Ä≠  But lost his life by female bribery.  [3]
‚Ä≠  Yet two sons author‚Äôd his posterity,
‚Ä≠  Alcm√¶on, and renown‚Äôd Amphilochus.
‚Ä≠  Mantius had issue Polyphidius,
‚Ä≠  And Clytus, but Aurora ravish‚Äôd him,
‚Ä≠  For excellence of his admir√©d limb,
‚Ä≠  And interested him amongst the Gods.
‚Ä≠  His brother knew men‚Äôs good and bad abodes
‚Ä≠  The best of all men, after the decease
‚Ä≠  Of him that perish‚Äôd in unnatural peace
‚Ä≠  At spacious Thebes.  Apollo did inspire
‚Ä≠  His knowing soul with a prophetic fire.
‚Ä≠  Who, angry with his father, took his way
‚Ä≠  To Hyperesia; where, making stay,
‚Ä≠  He prophesied to all men, and had there
‚Ä≠  A son call‚Äôd Theoclymenus, who here
‚Ä≠  Came to Telemachus, and found aboard
‚Ä≠  Himself at sacrifice, whom in a word
‚Ä≠  He thus saluted:  ‚ÄúO friend, since I find,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn here at ship, a sacrificing mind
‚Ä≠  Inform your actions, by your sacrifice,
‚Ä≠  And by that worthy choice of Deities
‚Ä≠  To whom you offer, by yourself, and all
‚Ä≠  These men that serve your course maritimal,
‚Ä≠  Tell one that asks the truth, nor give it glose,
‚Ä≠  Both who, and whence, you are?  From what seed rose
‚Ä≠  Your royal person?  And what city‚Äôs tow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  Hold habitation to your parents‚Äô pow‚Äôrs?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúStranger!  The sure truth is this:
‚Ä≠  I am of Ithaca; my father is
‚Ä≠  (Or was) Ulysses, but austere death now
‚Ä≠  Takes his state from him; whose event to know
‚Ä≠  Himself being long away, I set forth thus
‚Ä≠  With ship and soldiers.‚Äù  Theoclymenus
‚Ä≠  As freely said:  ‚ÄúAnd I to thee am fled
‚Ä≠  From forth my country, for a man struck dead
‚Ä≠  By my unhappy hand, who was with me
‚Ä≠  Of one self-tribe, and of his pedigree
‚Ä≠  Are many friends and brothers, and the sway
‚Ä≠  Of Achive kindred reacheth far away.
‚Ä≠  From whom, because I fear their spleens suborn
‚Ä≠  Blood and black fate against me (being born
‚Ä≠  To be a wand‚Äôrer among foreign men)
‚Ä≠  Make thy fair ship my rescue, and sustain
‚Ä≠  My life from slaughter.  Thy deservings may
‚Ä≠  Perform that mercy, and to them I pray.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúNor will I bar,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúthy will to make
‚Ä≠  My means and equal ship thy aid, but take
‚Ä≠  (With what we have here, in all friendly use)
‚Ä≠  Thy life from any violence that pursues.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus took he in his lance, and it extended
‚Ä≠  Aloft the hatches, which himself ascended.
‚Ä≠  The prince took seat at stern, on his right hand
‚Ä≠  Set Theoclymenus, and gave command
‚Ä≠  To all his men to arm, and see made fast
‚Ä≠  Amidst the hollow keel the beechen mast
‚Ä≠  With able halsers, hoise sail, launch; which soon
‚Ä≠  He saw obey‚Äôd.  And then his ship did run
‚Ä≠  A merry course; blue-eyed Minerva sent
‚Ä≠  A fore-right gale, tumultuous, vehement,
‚Ä≠  Along the air, that her way‚Äôs utmost yield
‚Ä≠  The ship might make, and plough the brackish field.
‚Ä≠     Then set the sun, and night black‚Äôd all the ways.
‚Ä≠  The ship, with Jove‚Äôs wind wing‚Äôd, where th‚Äô Epian sways,
‚Ä≠  Fetch‚Äôd Pheras first, then Elis the divine,
‚Ä≠  And then for those isles made, that sea-ward shine
‚Ä≠  For form and sharpness like a lance‚Äôs head,
‚Ä≠  About which lay the Wooers ambush√©d;
‚Ä≠  On which he rush‚Äôd, to try if he could ‚Äôscape
‚Ä≠  His plotted death, or serve her treach‚Äôrous rape.
‚Ä≠     And now return we to Eum√¶us‚Äô shed,
‚Ä≠  Where, at their food with others marshall√©d,
‚Ä≠  Ulysses and his noble herdsman sate.
‚Ä≠  To try if whose love‚Äôs curious estate
‚Ä≠  Stood firm to his abode, or felt it fade,
‚Ä≠  And so would take each best cause to persuade
‚Ä≠  His guest to town, Ulysses thus contends:
‚Ä≠    ‚ÄúHear me, Eum√¶us, and ye other friends.
‚Ä≠  Next morn to town I covet to be gone,
‚Ä≠  To beg some others‚Äô alms, not still charge one.
‚Ä≠  Advise me well then, and as well provide
‚Ä≠  I may be fitted with an honest guide,
‚Ä≠  For through the streets, since need will have it so,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll tread, to try if any will bestow
‚Ä≠  A dish of drink on me, or bit of bread,
‚Ä≠  Till to Ulysses‚Äô house I may be led;
‚Ä≠  And there I‚Äôll tell all-wise Penelope news,
‚Ä≠  Mix with the Wooers‚Äô pride, and, since they use
‚Ä≠  To fare above the full, their hands excite
‚Ä≠  To some small feast from out their infinite:
‚Ä≠  For which, I‚Äôll wait, and play the servingman,
‚Ä≠  Fairly enough, command the most they can.
‚Ä≠  For I will tell thee, note me well, and hear,
‚Ä≠  That, if the will be of Heav‚Äôn‚Äôs Messenger,
‚Ä≠  (Who to the works of men, of any sort,
‚Ä≠  Can grace infuse, and glory) nothing short
‚Ä≠  Am I of him, that doth to most aspire
‚Ä≠  In any service, as to build a fire,
‚Ä≠  To cleave sere wood, to roast or boil their meat,
‚Ä≠  To wait at board, mix wine, or know the neat,
‚Ä≠  Or any work, in which the poor-call‚Äôd worst
‚Ä≠  To serve the rich-call‚Äôd best in Fate are forc‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He, angry with him, said:  ‚ÄúAlas, poor guest,
‚Ä≠  Why did this counsel ever touch thy breast?
‚Ä≠  Thou seek‚Äôst thy utter spoil beyond all doubt,
‚Ä≠  If thou giv‚Äôst venture on the Wooers‚Äô rout,
‚Ä≠  Whose wrong and force affects the iron heav‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  Their light delights are far from being giv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  To such grave servitors.  Youths richly trick‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In coats or cassocks, locks divinely slick‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And looks most rapting, ever have the gift
‚Ä≠  To taste their crown‚Äôd cups, and full trenchers shift.
‚Ä≠  Their tables ever like their glasses shine,
‚Ä≠  Loaded with bread, with varied flesh, and wine.
‚Ä≠  And thou go thither?  Stay, for here do none
‚Ä≠  Grudge at thy presence, nor myself, nor one
‚Ä≠  Of all I feed.  But when Ulysses‚Äô son
‚Ä≠  Again shall greet us, he shall put thee on
‚Ä≠  Both coat and cassock, and thy quick retreat
‚Ä≠  Set where thy heart and soul desire thy seat.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Industrious Ulysses gave reply:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúI still much wish, that Heav‚Äôn‚Äôs chief Deity
‚Ä≠  Lov‚Äôd thee, as I do, that hast eas‚Äôd my mind
‚Ä≠  Of woes and wand‚Äôrings never yet confin‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  _Nought is more wretched in a human race,
‚Ä≠  Than country‚Äôs want, and shift from place to place._
‚Ä≠  But for the baneful belly men take care
‚Ä≠  Beyond good counsel, whosoever are
‚Ä≠  In compass of the wants it undergoes
‚Ä≠  By wand‚Äôrings, losses, or dependent woes.
‚Ä≠  Excuse me therefore, if I err‚Äôd at home;
‚Ä≠  Which since thou wilt make here, as overcome
‚Ä≠  With thy command for stay, I‚Äôll take on me
‚Ä≠  Cares appertaining to this place, like thee.
‚Ä≠  Does then Ulysses‚Äô sire, and mother, breathe,
‚Ä≠  Both whom he left in th‚Äô age next door to death?
‚Ä≠  Or are they breathless, and descended where
‚Ä≠  The dark house is, that never day doth clear?‚Äù
‚Ä≠      ‚ÄúLaertes lives,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúbut ev‚Äôry hour
‚Ä≠  Beseecheth Jove to take from him the pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  That joins his life and limbs; for with a moan
‚Ä≠  That breeds a marvel he laments his son
‚Ä≠  Depriv‚Äôd by death, and adds to that another
‚Ä≠  Of no less depth for that dead son‚Äôs dead mother,
‚Ä≠  Whom he a virgin wedded, which the more
‚Ä≠  Makes him lament her loss, and doth deplore
‚Ä≠  Yet more her miss, because her womb the truer
‚Ä≠  Was to his brave son, and his slaughter slew her.
‚Ä≠  Which last love to her doth his life engage,
‚Ä≠  And makes him live an undigested age.
‚Ä≠  O!  such a death she died as never may
‚Ä≠  Seize anyone that here beholds the day,
‚Ä≠  That either is to any man a friend,
‚Ä≠  Or can a woman kill in such a kind.
‚Ä≠  As long as she had being, I would be
‚Ä≠  A still inquirer (since ‚Äôtwas dear to me,
‚Ä≠  Though death to her, to hear his name) when she
‚Ä≠  Heard of Ulysses, for I might be bold,
‚Ä≠  She brought me up, and in her love did hold
‚Ä≠  My life, compar‚Äôd with long-veil‚Äôd Ctimen√©,
‚Ä≠  Her youngest issue (in some small degree
‚Ä≠  Her daughter yet preferr‚Äôd) a brave young dame.
‚Ä≠  And when of youth the dearly-lov√©d flame
‚Ä≠  Was lighted in us, marriage did prefer
‚Ä≠  The maid to Samos; whence was sent for her
‚Ä≠  Infinite riches, when the queen bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A fair new suit, new shoes, and all, and vow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Me to the field, but passing loth to part,
‚Ä≠  As loving me more than she lov‚Äôd her heart.
‚Ä≠  And these I want now; but their business grows
‚Ä≠  Upon me daily, which the Gods impose,
‚Ä≠  To whom I hold all, give account to them,
‚Ä≠  For I see none left to the diadem
‚Ä≠  That may dispose all better.  So, I drink
‚Ä≠  And eat of what is here; and whom I think
‚Ä≠  Worthy or rev‚Äôrend, I have giv‚Äôn to, still,
‚Ä≠  These kinds of guest-rites; for the household ill
‚Ä≠  (Which, where the queen is, riots) takes her still
‚Ä≠  From thought of these things.  Nor is it delight
‚Ä≠  To hear, from her plight, of or work or word;
‚Ä≠  The Wooers spoil all.  But yet my men will board
‚Ä≠  Her sorrows often with discourse of all,
‚Ä≠  Eating and drinking of the festival
‚Ä≠  That there is kept, and after bring to field
‚Ä≠  Such things as servants make their pleasures yield.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO me, Eum√¶us,‚Äù  said Laertes‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúHast thou then err‚Äôd so of a little one,
‚Ä≠  Like me, from friends and country?  Pray thee say,
‚Ä≠  And say a truth, doth vast Destruction lay
‚Ä≠  Her hand upon the wide-way‚Äôd seat of men,  [4]
‚Ä≠  Where dwelt thy sire and rev‚Äôrend mother then,
‚Ä≠  That thou art spar‚Äôd there?  Or else, set alone
‚Ä≠  In guard of beeves, or sheep, set th‚Äô enemy on,
‚Ä≠  Surpris‚Äôd, and shipp‚Äôd, transferr‚Äôd, and sold thee here?
‚Ä≠  He that bought thee paid well, yet bought not dear.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúSince thou enquir‚Äôst of that, my guest,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúHear and be silent, and, mean space, sit free
‚Ä≠  In use of these cups to thy most delights;
‚Ä≠  Unspeakable in length now are the nights.
‚Ä≠  Those that affect sleep yet, to sleep have leave,
‚Ä≠  Those that affect to hear, their hearers give.
‚Ä≠  But sleep not ere your hour; _much sleep doth grieve._
‚Ä≠  Whoever lists to sleep, away to bed,
‚Ä≠  Together with the morning raise his head,
‚Ä≠  Together with his fellows break his fast,
‚Ä≠  And then his lord‚Äôs herd drive to their repast.
‚Ä≠  We two, still in our tabernacle here
‚Ä≠  Drinking and eating, will our bosoms cheer
‚Ä≠  With memories and tales of our annoys.
‚Ä≠  _Betwixt his sorrows ev‚Äôry human joys,_
‚Ä≠  He most, who most hath felt and furthest err‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  And now thy will to act shall be preferr‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     There is an isle above Ortygia,
‚Ä≠  If thou hast heard, they call it Syria,
‚Ä≠  Where, once a day, the sun moves backward still.
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTis not so great as good, for it doth fill
‚Ä≠  The fields with oxen, fills them still with sheep,
‚Ä≠  Fills roofs with wine, and makes all corn there cheap.
‚Ä≠  No dearth comes ever there, nor no disease
‚Ä≠  That doth with hate us wretched mortals seize,
‚Ä≠  But when men‚Äôs varied nations, dwelling there
‚Ä≠  In any city, enter th‚Äô aged year,
‚Ä≠  The silver-bow-bearer, the Sun, and She
‚Ä≠  That bears as much renown for archery,
‚Ä≠  Stoop with their painless shafts, and strike them dead,
‚Ä≠  As one would sleep, and never keep the bed.
‚Ä≠  In this isle stand two cities, betwixt whom
‚Ä≠  All things that of the soil‚Äôs fertility come
‚Ä≠  In two parts are divided.  And both these
‚Ä≠  My father rul‚Äôd, Ctesius Ormenides,
‚Ä≠  A man like the Immortals.  With these states
‚Ä≠  The cross-biting Ph≈ìnicians traffick‚Äôd rates
‚Ä≠  Of infinite merchandise in ships brought there,
‚Ä≠  In which they then were held exempt from peer.
‚Ä≠     There dwelt within my father‚Äôs house a dame,
‚Ä≠  Born a Ph≈ìnician, skilful in the frame
‚Ä≠  Of noble housewif‚Äôries, right tall and fair.
‚Ä≠  Her the Ph≈ìnician great-wench-net-lay‚Äôr  [5]
‚Ä≠  With sweet words circumvented, as she was
‚Ä≠  Washing her linen.  To his amorous pass
‚Ä≠  He brought her first, shor‚Äôd from his ship to her;
‚Ä≠  To whom he did his whole life‚Äôs love prefer,
‚Ä≠  Which of these breast-exposing dames the hearts
‚Ä≠  Deceives, though fashion‚Äôd of right honest parts.
‚Ä≠  He ask‚Äôd her after, what she was, and whence?
‚Ä≠  She, passing presently, the excellence
‚Ä≠  Told of her father‚Äôs turrets, and that she
‚Ä≠  Might boast herself sprung from the progeny
‚Ä≠  Of the rich Sidons, and the daughter was
‚Ä≠  Of the much-year-rev√©nued Arybas;
‚Ä≠  But that the Taphian pirates made her prise,
‚Ä≠  As she return‚Äôd from her field-housewif‚Äôries,
‚Ä≠  Transferr‚Äôd her hither, and, at that man‚Äôs house
‚Ä≠  Where now she liv‚Äôd, for value precious
‚Ä≠  Sold her to th‚Äô owner.  He that stole her love
‚Ä≠  Bade her again to her birth‚Äôs seat remove,
‚Ä≠  To see the fair roofs of her friends again,
‚Ä≠  Who still held state, and did the port maintain
‚Ä≠  Herself reported.  She said:  ‚ÄòBe it so,
‚Ä≠  So you, and all that in your ship shall row,
‚Ä≠  Swear to return me in all safety hence.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     All swore.  Th‚Äô oath past, with ev‚Äôry consequence,
‚Ä≠  She bade: ‚ÄòBe silent now, and not a word
‚Ä≠  Do you, or any of your friends, afford,
‚Ä≠  Meeting me afterward in any way,
‚Ä≠  Or at the washing-fount; lest some display
‚Ä≠  Be made, and told the old man, and he then
‚Ä≠  Keep me strait bound, to you and to your men
‚Ä≠  The utter ruin plotting of your lives.
‚Ä≠  Keep in firm thought then ev‚Äôry word that strives
‚Ä≠  For dang‚Äôrous utt‚Äôrance.  Haste your ship‚Äôs full freight
‚Ä≠  Of what you traffic for, and let me straight
‚Ä≠  Know by some sent friend she hath all in hold,
‚Ä≠  And with myself I‚Äôll bring thence all the gold
‚Ä≠  I can by all means finger; and, beside,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll do my best to see your freight supplied
‚Ä≠  With some well-weighing burthen of mine own.
‚Ä≠  For I bring-up in house a great man‚Äôs son,
‚Ä≠  As crafty as myself, who will with me
‚Ä≠  Run ev‚Äôry way along, and I will be
‚Ä≠  His leader, till your ship hath made him sure.
‚Ä≠  He will an infinite great price procure,
‚Ä≠  Transfer him to what languag‚Äôd men ye may.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This said, she gat her home, and there made stay
‚Ä≠  A whole year with us, goods of great avail
‚Ä≠  Their ship enriching.  Which now fit for sail,
‚Ä≠  They sent a messenger t‚Äô inform the dame;
‚Ä≠  And to my father‚Äôs house a fellow came,
‚Ä≠  Full of Ph≈ìnician craft, that to be sold
‚Ä≠  A tablet brought, the body all of gold,
‚Ä≠  The verge all-amber.  This had ocular view
‚Ä≠  Both by my honour‚Äôd mother and the crew
‚Ä≠  Of her house-handmaids, handled, and the price
‚Ä≠  Beat, ask‚Äôd, and promis‚Äôd.  And while this device
‚Ä≠  Lay thus upon the forge, this jeweller
‚Ä≠  Made privy signs, by winks and wiles, to her
‚Ä≠  That was his object; which she took, and he,
‚Ä≠  His sign seeing noted, hied to ship.  When she,
‚Ä≠  (My hand still taking, as she us‚Äôd to do
‚Ä≠  To walk abroad with her) convey‚Äôd me so
‚Ä≠  Abroad with her, and in the portico
‚Ä≠  Found cups, with tasted viands, which the guests
‚Ä≠  That us‚Äôd to flock about my father‚Äôs feasts
‚Ä≠  Had left.  They gone (some to the council-court,
‚Ä≠  Some to hear news amongst the talking sort)
‚Ä≠  Her theft three bowls into her lap convey‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And forth she went.  Nor was my wit so stay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To stay her, or myself.  The sun went down,
‚Ä≠  And shadows round about the world were flown,
‚Ä≠  When we came to the haven, in which did ride
‚Ä≠  The swift Ph≈ìnician ship; whose fair broad side
‚Ä≠  They boarded straight, took us up; and all went
‚Ä≠  Along the moist waves.  Wind Saturnius sent.
‚Ä≠  Six days we day and night sail‚Äôd; but when Jove
‚Ä≠  Put up the seventh day, She that shafts doth love
‚Ä≠  Shot dead the woman, who into the pump
‚Ä≠  Like to a dop-chick div‚Äôd, and gave a thump
‚Ä≠  In her sad settling.  Forth they cast her then
‚Ä≠  To serve the fish and sea-calves, no more men;
‚Ä≠  But I was left there with a heavy heart;
‚Ä≠  When wind and water drave them quit apart
‚Ä≠  Their own course, and on Ithaca they fell,
‚Ä≠  And there poor me did to Laertes sell.
‚Ä≠  And thus these eyes the sight of this isle prov‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúEum√¶us,‚Äù  he replied,  ‚Äúthou much hast mov‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The mind in me with all things thou hast said,
‚Ä≠  And all the suff‚Äôrance on thy bosom laid,
‚Ä≠  But, truly, to thy ill hath Jove join‚Äôd good,
‚Ä≠  That one whose veins are serv‚Äôd with human blood
‚Ä≠  Hath bought thy service, that gives competence
‚Ä≠  Of food, wine, cloth to thee; and sure th‚Äô expence
‚Ä≠  Of thy life‚Äôs date here is of good desert,
‚Ä≠  Whose labours not to thee alone impart
‚Ä≠  Sufficient food and housing, but to me;
‚Ä≠  Where I through many a heap‚Äôd humanity
‚Ä≠  Have hither err‚Äôd, where, though, like thee, not sold,
‚Ä≠  Nor stay‚Äôd like thee yet, nor nought needful hold.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This mutual speech they us‚Äôd, nor had they slept
‚Ä≠  Much time before the much-near morning leapt
‚Ä≠  To her fair throne.  And now struck sail the men
‚Ä≠  That serv‚Äôd Telemachus, arriv‚Äôd just then
‚Ä≠  Near his lov‚Äôd shore; where now they stoop‚Äôd the mast,
‚Ä≠  Made to the port with oars, and anchor cast,
‚Ä≠  Made fast the ship, and then ashore they went,
‚Ä≠  Dress‚Äôd supper, fill‚Äôd wine; when (their appetites spent)
‚Ä≠  Telemachus commanded they should yield
‚Ä≠  The ship to th‚Äô owner, while himself at field
‚Ä≠  Would see his shepherds; when light drew to end
‚Ä≠  He would his gifts see, and to town descend,
‚Ä≠  And in the morning at a feast bestow
‚Ä≠  Rewards for all their pains.  ‚ÄúAnd whither, now,‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Said Theoclymenus,  ‚Äúmy lov√©d son,
‚Ä≠  Shall I address myself?  Whose mansi√≥n,
‚Ä≠  Of all men, in this rough-hewn isle, shall I
‚Ä≠  Direct my way to?  Or go readily
‚Ä≠  To thy house and thy mother?‚Äù  He replied:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúAnother time I‚Äôll see you satisfied
‚Ä≠  With my house-entertainment, but as now
‚Ä≠  You should encounter none that could bestow
‚Ä≠  Your fit entreaty, and (which less grace were)
‚Ä≠  You could not see my mother, I not there;
‚Ä≠  For she‚Äôs no frequent object, but apart
‚Ä≠  Keeps from her Wooers, woo‚Äôd with her desert,
‚Ä≠  Up in her chamber, at her housewif‚Äôry
‚Ä≠  But I‚Äôll name one to whom you shall apply
‚Ä≠  Direct repair, and that‚Äôs Eurymachus,
‚Ä≠  Renown‚Äôd descent to wise Polybius,
‚Ä≠  A man whom th‚Äô Ithacensians look on now
‚Ä≠  As on a God, since he of all that woo
‚Ä≠  Is far superior man, and likest far
‚Ä≠  To wed my mother, and as circular
‚Ä≠  Be in that honour as Ulysses was.
‚Ä≠  But heav‚Äôn-hous‚Äôd Jove knows the yet hidden pass
‚Ä≠  Of her disposure, and on them he may
‚Ä≠  A blacker sight bring than her nuptial day.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     As this he utter‚Äôd, on his right hand flew
‚Ä≠  A saker, sacred to the God of view,
‚Ä≠  That in his talons truss‚Äôd and plum‚Äôd a dove;
‚Ä≠  The feathers round about the ship did rove,
‚Ä≠  And on Telemachus fell; whom th‚Äô augur then
‚Ä≠  Took fast by the hand, withdrew him from his men,
‚Ä≠  And said: ‚ÄúTelemachus!  This hawk is sent
‚Ä≠  From God; I knew it for a sure ostent
‚Ä≠  When first I saw it.  Be you well assur‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  There will no Wooer be by heav‚Äôn endur‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To rule in Ithaca above your race,
‚Ä≠  But your pow‚Äôrs ever fill the regal place.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI wish to heav‚Äôn,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúthy word might stand,
‚Ä≠  Thou then shouldst soon acknowledge from my hand
‚Ä≠  Such gifts and friendship, as would make thee, guest,
‚Ä≠  Met and saluted as no less than blest.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he call‚Äôd Pir√¶us, Clytus‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  His true associate, saying: ‚ÄúThou hast done
‚Ä≠  (Of all my followers to the Pylian shore)
‚Ä≠  My will in chief in other things, once more
‚Ä≠  Be chiefly good to me; take to thy house
‚Ä≠  This lov√©d stranger, and be studious
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô embrace and greet him with thy greatest fare,
‚Ä≠  Till I myself come and take off thy care.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The famous-for-his-lance said:  ‚ÄúIf your stay
‚Ä≠  Take time for life here, this man‚Äôs care I‚Äôll lay
‚Ä≠  On my performance, nor what fits a guest
‚Ä≠  Shall any penury withhold his feast.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus took he ship, bade them board, and away.
‚Ä≠  They boarded, sat, but did their labour stay
‚Ä≠  Till he had deck‚Äôd his feet, and reached his lance.
‚Ä≠  They to the city; he did straight advance
‚Ä≠  Up to his styes, where swine lay for him store,
‚Ä≠  By whose side did his honest swine-herd snore,
‚Ä≠  Till his short cares his longest nights had ended,
‚Ä≠  And nothing worse to both his lords intended.

‚Ä≠  THE SIXTEENTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  The Prince at field, he sends to town
‚Ä≠  Eum√¶us, to make truly known
‚Ä≠  His safe return.  By Pallas‚Äô will,
‚Ä≠  Telemachus is giv‚Äôn the skill
‚Ä≠  To know his father.  Those that lay
‚Ä≠  In ambush, to prevent the way
‚Ä≠  Of young Ulyssides for home,
‚Ä≠  Retire, with anger overcome.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _Œ†ŒπÃë._
‚Ä≠     To his most dear
‚Ä≠        Ulysses shows.
‚Ä≠     The wise-son here
‚Ä≠        His father knows.

‚Ä≠  Ulysses and divine Eum√¶us rose
‚Ä≠  Soon as the morning could her eyes unclose,
‚Ä≠  Made fire, brake fast, and to their pasture send
‚Ä≠  The gather‚Äôd herds, on whom their swains attend.
‚Ä≠  The self-tire barking dogs all fawn‚Äôd upon,
‚Ä≠  Nor bark‚Äôd, at first sight of Ulysses‚Äô son.
‚Ä≠  The whinings of their fawnings yet did greet
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô ears, and sounds of certain feet,
‚Ä≠  Who thus bespake Eum√¶us:  ‚ÄúSure some friend,
‚Ä≠  Or one well-known, comes, that the mastiffs spend
‚Ä≠  Their mouths no louder.  Only some one near
‚Ä≠  They whine, and leap about, whose feet I hear.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Each word of this speech was not spent, before
‚Ä≠  His son stood in the entry of the door.
‚Ä≠  Out-rush‚Äôd amaz‚Äôd Eum√¶us, and let go
‚Ä≠  The cup to earth, that he had labour‚Äôd so,
‚Ä≠  Cleans‚Äôd for the neat wine, did the prince-surprise,
‚Ä≠  Kiss‚Äôd his fair forehead, both his lovely eyes,
‚Ä≠  Both his white hands, and tender tears distill‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  There breath‚Äôd no kind-soul‚Äôd father that was fill‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Less with his son‚Äôs embraces, that had liv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Ten years in far-off earth, now new retriev‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  His only child too, gotten in his age,
‚Ä≠  And for whose absence he had felt the rage
‚Ä≠  Of griefs upon him, than for this divin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  So-much-for-form was this divine-for-mind;
‚Ä≠  Who kiss‚Äôd him through, who grew about him kissing,
‚Ä≠  As fresh from death ‚Äôscap‚Äôd.  Whom so long time missing,
‚Ä≠  He wept for joy, and said:  ‚ÄúThou yet art come,
‚Ä≠  Sweet light, sweet sun-rise, to thy cloudy home.
‚Ä≠  O, never I look‚Äôd, when once shipp‚Äôd away
‚Ä≠  For Pylos‚Äô shores, to see thy turning day.
‚Ä≠  Come, enter, lov‚Äôd son, let me feast my heart
‚Ä≠  With thy sweet sight, new-come, so far apart.
‚Ä≠  Nor, when you liv‚Äôd at home, would you walk down
‚Ä≠  Often enough here, but stay‚Äôd still at town;
‚Ä≠  It pleas‚Äôd you then to cast such forehand view
‚Ä≠  About your house on that most damn√©d crew.‚Äù  [1]
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúIt shall be so then, friend,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúbut now
‚Ä≠  I come to glad mine eyes with thee, and know
‚Ä≠  If still my mother in her house remain,
‚Ä≠  Or if some Wooer hath aspir‚Äôd to gain
‚Ä≠  Of her in nuptials; for Ulysses‚Äô bed,
‚Ä≠  By this, lies all with spiders‚Äôs cobwebs spread,
‚Ä≠  In penury of him that should supply it.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúShe still,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúholds her most constant quiet,
‚Ä≠  Aloft thine own house, for the bed‚Äôs respect;
‚Ä≠  But, for her lord‚Äôs sad loss, sad nights and days
‚Ä≠  Obscure her beauties, and corrupt their rays.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, Eum√¶us took his brazen spear,
‚Ä≠  And in he went; when, being enter‚Äôd near
‚Ä≠  Within the stony threshold; from his seat
‚Ä≠  His father rose to him, who would not let
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô old man remove, but drew him back and prest
‚Ä≠  With earnest terms his sitting, saying:  ‚ÄúGuest,
‚Ä≠  Take here your seat again, we soon shall get
‚Ä≠  Within our own house here some other seat.
‚Ä≠  Here‚Äôs one will fetch it.‚Äù  This said, down again
‚Ä≠  His father sat, and to his son his swain
‚Ä≠  Strew‚Äôd fair green osiers, and impos‚Äôd thereon
‚Ä≠  A good soft sheepskin, which made him a throne.
‚Ä≠     Then he appos‚Äôd to them his last-left roast,
‚Ä≠  And in a wicker basket bread engrost,
‚Ä≠  Fill‚Äôd luscious wine, and then took opposite seat
‚Ä≠  To the divine Ulysses.  When, the meat
‚Ä≠  Set there before them, all fell-to, and eat.
‚Ä≠  When they had fed, the prince said:  ‚ÄúPray thee say,
‚Ä≠  Whence comes this guest?  What seaman gave him way
‚Ä≠  To this our isle? I hope these feet of his
‚Ä≠  Could walk no water.  Who boasts he he is?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell all truly son:  From ample Crete
‚Ä≠  He boasts himself, and says, his erring feet
‚Ä≠  Have many cities trod, and God was he
‚Ä≠  Whose finger wrought in his infirmity.
‚Ä≠  But, to my cottage, the last ‚Äôscape of his
‚Ä≠  Was from a Thesprot‚Äôs ship.  Whate‚Äôer he is,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll give him you, do what you please; his vaunt
‚Ä≠  Is, that he is, at most, a suppliant.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúEum√¶us,‚Äù  said the prince,  ‚Äúto tell me this,
‚Ä≠  You have afflicted my weak faculties;
‚Ä≠  For how shall I receive him to my house
‚Ä≠  With any safety, that suspicious
‚Ä≠  Of my young forces (should I be assay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With any sudden violence) may want aid
‚Ä≠  To shield myself? Besides, if I go home,
‚Ä≠  My mother is with two doubts overcome,
‚Ä≠  If she shall stay with me, and take fit care
‚Ä≠  For all such guests as there seek guestive fare,
‚Ä≠  Her husband‚Äôs bed respecting, and her fame
‚Ä≠  Amongst the people; or her blood may frame
‚Ä≠  A liking to some Wooer, such as best
‚Ä≠  May bed her in his house, not giving least.
‚Ä≠  And thus am I unsure of all means free
‚Ä≠  To use a guest there, fit for his degree.
‚Ä≠  But, being thy guest, I‚Äôll be his supply
‚Ä≠  For all weeds, such as mere necessity
‚Ä≠  Shall more than furnish.  Fit him with a sword,
‚Ä≠  And set him where his heart would have been shor‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  Or, if so pleas‚Äôd, receive him in thy shed,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll send thee clothes, I vow, and all the bread
‚Ä≠  His wish would eat, that to thy men and thee
‚Ä≠  He be no burthen.  But that I should be
‚Ä≠  His mean to my house; where a company
‚Ä≠  Of wrong-professing Wooers wildly live,
‚Ä≠  I will in no sort author, lest they give
‚Ä≠  Foul use to him, and me as gravely grieve.
‚Ä≠  For what great act can anyone achieve
‚Ä≠  Against a multitude, although his mind
‚Ä≠  Retain a courage of the greatest kind?
‚Ä≠  For all minds have not force in one degree.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Ulysses answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúO friend, since ‚Äôtis free
‚Ä≠  For any man to change fit words with thee,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll freely speak:  Methinks, a wolfish pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  My heart puts on to tear and to devour,
‚Ä≠  To hear your affirmation, that, in spite
‚Ä≠  Of what may fall on you, made opposite,
‚Ä≠  Being one of your proportion, birth, and age,
‚Ä≠  These Wooers should in such injustice rage.
‚Ä≠  What should the cause be?  Do you wilfully
‚Ä≠  Endure their spoil?  Or hath your empery
‚Ä≠  Been such amongst your people, that all gather
‚Ä≠  In troop, and one voice (which ev‚Äôn God doth father)
‚Ä≠  And vow your hate so, that they suffer them?
‚Ä≠  Or blame your kinsfolk‚Äôs faiths, before th‚Äô extreme
‚Ä≠  Of your first stroke hath tried them, whom a man,
‚Ä≠  When strifes to blows rise, trusts, though battle ran
‚Ä≠  In huge and high waves?  Would to heav‚Äôn my spirit
‚Ä≠  Such youth breath‚Äôd, as the man that must inherit
‚Ä≠  Yet-never-touch‚Äôd Ulysses, or that he,
‚Ä≠  But wand‚Äôring this way, would but come, and see
‚Ä≠  What my age could achieve (and there is Fate
‚Ä≠  For Hope yet left, that he may recreate
‚Ä≠  His eyes with such an object) this my head
‚Ä≠  Should any stranger strike off, if stark dead
‚Ä≠  I struck not all, the house in open force
‚Ä≠  Ent‚Äôring with challenge!  If their great concourse
‚Ä≠  Did over-lay me, being a man alone,
‚Ä≠  (Which you urge for yourself) be you that one,
‚Ä≠  I rather in mine own house wish to die
‚Ä≠  One death for all, than so indecently
‚Ä≠  See evermore deeds worse than death applied,
‚Ä≠  Guests wrong‚Äôd with vile words and blow-giving pride,
‚Ä≠  The women-servants dragg‚Äôd in filthy kind
‚Ä≠  About the fair house, and in corners blind
‚Ä≠  Made serve the rapes of ruffians, food devour‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Idly and rudely, wine exhaust, and pour‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Through throats profane; and all about a deed
‚Ä≠  That‚Äôs ever wooing, and will never speed.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you, guest, most truly,‚Äù  said his son,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúI do not think that all my people run
‚Ä≠  One hateful course against me; nor accuse
‚Ä≠  Kinsfolks that I in strifes of weight might use;
‚Ä≠  But Jove will have it so, our race alone
‚Ä≠  (As if made singular) to one and one
‚Ä≠  His hand confining.  Only to the king,
‚Ä≠  Jove-bred Arcesius, did Laertes spring;
‚Ä≠  Only to old Laertes did descend
‚Ä≠  Ulysses; only to Ulysses‚Äô end
‚Ä≠  Am I the adjunct, whom he left so young,
‚Ä≠  That from me to him never comfort sprung.
‚Ä≠  And to all these now, for their race, arise
‚Ä≠  Up in their house a brood of enemies.
‚Ä≠  As many as in these isles bow men‚Äôs knees,
‚Ä≠  Samos, Dulichius, and the rich-in-trees
‚Ä≠  Zacynthus, or in this rough isle‚Äôs command,
‚Ä≠  So many suitors for the nuptials stand,
‚Ä≠  That ask my mother, and, mean space, prefer
‚Ä≠  Their lusts to all spoil, that dishonour her.
‚Ä≠  Nor doth she, though she loaths, deny their suits,
‚Ä≠  Nor they denials take, though taste their fruits.
‚Ä≠  But all this time the state of all things there
‚Ä≠  Their throats devour, and I must shortly bear
‚Ä≠  A part in all.  And yet the periods
‚Ä≠  Of these designs lie in the knees of Gods.
‚Ä≠  Of all loves then, Eum√¶us, make quick way
‚Ä≠  To wise Penelop√©, and to her say
‚Ä≠  My safe return from Pylos, and alone,
‚Ä≠  Return thou hither, having made it known.
‚Ä≠  Nor let, besides my mother, any ear
‚Ä≠  Partake thy message, since a number bear
‚Ä≠  My safe return displeasure.‚Äù  He replied;
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI know, and comprehend you.  You divide
‚Ä≠  Your mind with one that understands you well.
‚Ä≠  But, all in one yet, may I not reveal
‚Ä≠  To th‚Äô old hard-fated Arcesiades
‚Ä≠  Your safe return?  Who, through his whole distress
‚Ä≠  Felt for Ulysses, did not yet so grieve,
‚Ä≠  But with his household he had will to live,
‚Ä≠  And serv‚Äôd his appetite with wine and food,
‚Ä≠  Survey‚Äôd his husbandry, and did his blood
‚Ä≠  Some comforts fitting life; but since you took
‚Ä≠  Your ship for Pylos, he would never brook
‚Ä≠  Or wine or food, they say, nor cast an eye
‚Ä≠  On any labour, but sits weeping by,
‚Ä≠  And sighing out his sorrows, ceaseless moans
‚Ä≠  Wasting his body, turn‚Äôd all skin and bones.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúMore sad news still,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúyet, mourn he still;
‚Ä≠  For if the rule of all men‚Äôs works be will,
‚Ä≠  And his will his way goes, mine stands inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô attend the home-turn of my nearer kind.  [2]
‚Ä≠  Do then what I enjoin; which giv‚Äôn effect,
‚Ä≠  Err nor to field to him, but turn direct,
‚Ä≠  Entreating first my mother, with most speed,
‚Ä≠  And all the secrecy that now serves need,
‚Ä≠  To send this way their store-house guardian,
‚Ä≠  And she shall tell all to the aged man.‚Äù  [3]
‚Ä≠     He took his shoes up, put them on, and went.
‚Ä≠  Nor was his absence hid from Jove‚Äôs descent,
‚Ä≠  Divine Minerva, who took straight to view,
‚Ä≠  A goodly woman‚Äôs shape that all works knew,
‚Ä≠  And, standing in the entry, did prefer
‚Ä≠  Her sight t‚Äô Ulysses; but, though meeting her,
‚Ä≠  His son Telemachus nor saw nor knew.
‚Ä≠  _The Gods‚Äô clear presences are know to few._
‚Ä≠  Yet, with Ulysses, ev‚Äôn the dogs did see,
‚Ä≠  And would not bark, but, whining lovingly,
‚Ä≠  Fled to the stall‚Äôs far side.  When she her eyne
‚Ä≠  Mov‚Äôd to Ulysses; he knew her design,
‚Ä≠  And left the house, pass‚Äôd the great sheep-cote‚Äôs wall,
‚Ä≠  And stood before her.  She bade utter all
‚Ä≠  Now to his son, nor keep the least unlos‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  That, all the Wooers‚Äô deaths being now dispos‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  They might approach the town; affirming; she
‚Ä≠  Not long would fail t‚Äô assist to victory.
‚Ä≠     This said, she laid her golden rod on him,
‚Ä≠  And with his late-worn weeds grac‚Äôd ev‚Äôry limb,
‚Ä≠  His body straighten‚Äôd, and his youth instill‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  His fresh blood call‚Äôd up, ev‚Äôry wrinkle fill‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  About his broken eyes, and on his chin
‚Ä≠  The brown hair spread.  When his whole trim wrought in,
‚Ä≠  She issued, and he enter‚Äôd to his son,
‚Ä≠  Who stood amaz‚Äôd, and thought some God had done
‚Ä≠  His house that honour, turn‚Äôd away his eyes,
‚Ä≠  And said;  ‚ÄúNow guest, you grace another guise
‚Ä≠  Than suits your late show.  Other weeds you wear,
‚Ä≠  And other person.  Of the starry sphere
‚Ä≠  You certainly present some deathless God.
‚Ä≠  Be pleas‚Äôd, that to your here-vouchsaf‚Äôd abode
‚Ä≠  We may give sacred rites, and offer gold,
‚Ä≠  To do us favour.‚Äù  He replied;  ‚ÄúI hold
‚Ä≠  No deified state.  Why put you thus on me
‚Ä≠  A God‚Äôs resemblance?  I am only he
‚Ä≠  That bears thy father‚Äôs name; for whose lov‚Äôd sake
‚Ä≠  Thy youth so grieves, whose absence makes thee take
‚Ä≠  Such wrongs of men.‚Äù  Thus kiss‚Äôd he him, nor could
‚Ä≠  Forbear those tears that in such mighty hold
‚Ä≠  He held before, still held, still issuing ever;
‚Ä≠  And now, the shores once broke, the springtide never
‚Ä≠  Forbore earth from the cheeks he kiss‚Äôd.  His son,
‚Ä≠  By all these violent arguments not won
‚Ä≠  To credit him his father, did deny
‚Ä≠  His kind assumpt, and said, some Deity
‚Ä≠  Feign‚Äôd that joy‚Äôs cause, to make him grieve the more;
‚Ä≠  Affirming, that no man, whoever wore
‚Ä≠  The garment of mortality, could take,
‚Ä≠  By any utmost pow‚Äôr his soul could make,
‚Ä≠  Such change into it, since, at so much will,
‚Ä≠  Not Jove himself could both remove and fill
‚Ä≠  Old age with youth, and youth with age so spoil,
‚Ä≠  In such an instant.   ‚ÄúYou wore all the soil
‚Ä≠  Of age but now, and were old; and but now
‚Ä≠  You bear that young grace that the Gods indow
‚Ä≠  Their heav‚Äôn-born forms withal.‚Äù  His father said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúTelemachus!  Admire, nor stand dismay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  But know thy solid father; since within
‚Ä≠  He answers all parts that adorn his skin.
‚Ä≠  There shall no more Ulyssesses come here.
‚Ä≠  I am the man, that now this twentieth year
‚Ä≠  (Still under suff‚Äôrance of a world of ill)
‚Ä≠  My country-earth recover.  ‚ÄôTis the will
‚Ä≠  The prey-professor Pallas puts in act,
‚Ä≠  Who put me thus together, thus distract
‚Ä≠  In aged pieces as ev‚Äôn now you saw,
‚Ä≠  This youth now rend‚Äôring.  ‚ÄôTis within the law
‚Ä≠  Of her free pow‚Äôr.  Sometimes to show me poor,
‚Ä≠  Sometimes again thus amply to restore
‚Ä≠  My youth and ornaments, she still would please.
‚Ä≠  _The Gods can raise, and throw men down, with ease.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     This said, he sat; when his Telemachus pour‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Himself about him; tears on tears he show‚Äôr‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And to desire of moan increas‚Äôd the cloud.
‚Ä≠  Both wept and howl‚Äôd, and laid out shrieks more loud
‚Ä≠  Than or the bird-bone-breaking eagle rears,
‚Ä≠  Or brood-kind vulture with the crooked seres,
‚Ä≠  When rustic hands their tender eyries draw,
‚Ä≠  Before they give their wings their full-plum‚Äôd law.
‚Ä≠  But miserably pour‚Äôd they from beneath
‚Ä≠  Their lids their tears, while both their breasts did breathe
‚Ä≠  As frequent cries; and, to their fervent moan,
‚Ä≠  The light had left the skies, if first the son
‚Ä≠  Their dumb moans had not vented, with demand
‚Ä≠  What ship it was that gave the natural land
‚Ä≠  To his bless‚Äôd feet?  He then did likewise lay
‚Ä≠  Hand on his passion, and gave these words way:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell thee truth, my son:  The men that bear
‚Ä≠  Much fame for shipping, my reducers were
‚Ä≠  To long-wish‚Äôd Ithaca, who each man else
‚Ä≠  That greets their shore give pass to where he dwells.
‚Ä≠  The Ph√¶acensian peers, in one night‚Äôs date,
‚Ä≠  While I fast slept, fetch‚Äôd th‚Äô Ithacensian state,
‚Ä≠  Grac‚Äôd me with wealthy gifts, brass, store of gold,
‚Ä≠  And robes fair-wrought; all which have secret hold
‚Ä≠  In caves that by the Gods‚Äô advice I chus‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  And now Minerva‚Äôs admonitions us‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  For this retreat, that we might here dispose
‚Ä≠  In close discourse the slaughters of our foes.
‚Ä≠  Recount the number of the Wooers then,
‚Ä≠  And let me know what name they hold with men,
‚Ä≠  That my mind may cast over their estates
‚Ä≠  A curious measure, and confer the rates
‚Ä≠  Of our two pow‚Äôrs and theirs, to try, if we
‚Ä≠  Alone may propagate to victory
‚Ä≠  Our bold encounters of them all, or prove
‚Ä≠  The kind assistance of some others‚Äô love.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO father,‚Äù  he replied,  ‚ÄúI oft have heard
‚Ä≠  Your counsels and your force of hand preferr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To mighty glory, but your speeches now
‚Ä≠  Your vent‚Äôrous mind exceeding mighty show.
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn to amaze they move me; for, in right
‚Ä≠  Of no fit counsel, should be brought to fight
‚Ä≠  Two men ‚Äôgainst th‚Äô able faction of a throng.
‚Ä≠  No one two, no one ten, no twice ten, strong
‚Ä≠  These Wooers are, but more by much.  For know,
‚Ä≠  That from Dulichius there are fifty-two,
‚Ä≠  All choice young men; and ev‚Äôry one of these
‚Ä≠  Six men attend.  From Samos cross‚Äôd the seas
‚Ä≠  Twice-twelve young gallants.  From Zacynthus came
‚Ä≠  Twice-ten.  Of Ithaca, the best of name,
‚Ä≠  Twice-six.  Of all which all the state they take
‚Ä≠  A sacred poet and a herald make.
‚Ä≠  Their delicacies two, of special sort
‚Ä≠  In skill of banquets, serve.  And all this port
‚Ä≠  If we shall dare t‚Äô encounter, all-thrust-up
‚Ä≠  In one strong roof, have great care lest the cup,
‚Ä≠  Your great mind thirsts, exceeding bitter taste,
‚Ä≠  And your retreat commend not to your haste
‚Ä≠  Your great attempt, but make you say, you buy
‚Ä≠  Their pride‚Äôs revenges at a price too high.
‚Ä≠  And therefore, if you could; ‚Äôtwere well you thought
‚Ä≠  Of some assistant.  Be your spirit wrought
‚Ä≠  In such a man‚Äôs election, as may lend
‚Ä≠  His succours freely, and express a friend.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     His father answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúLet me ask of thee;
‚Ä≠  Hear me, consider, and then answer me.
‚Ä≠  Think‚Äôst thou, if Pallas and the King of skies
‚Ä≠  We had to friend, would their sufficiencies
‚Ä≠  Make strong our part?  Or that some other yet
‚Ä≠  My thoughts must work for?‚Äù  ‚ÄúThese,‚Äù  said he  ‚Äúare set
‚Ä≠  Aloft the clouds, and are found aids indeed,
‚Ä≠  As pow‚Äôrs not only that these men exceed,
‚Ä≠  But bear of all men else the high command,
‚Ä≠  And hold of Gods an overruling hand.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúWell then,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúnot these shall sever long
‚Ä≠  Their force and ours in fights assur‚Äôd and strong.
‚Ä≠  And then ‚Äôtwixt us and them shall Mars prefer
‚Ä≠  His strength, to stand our great distinguisher,
‚Ä≠  When in mine own roofs I am forc‚Äôd to blows.
‚Ä≠  But when the day shall first her fires disclose,
‚Ä≠  Go thou for home, and troop up with the Wooers,
‚Ä≠  Thy will with theirs join‚Äôd, pow‚Äôr with their rude pow‚Äôrs;
‚Ä≠  And after shall the herdsman guide to town
‚Ä≠  My steps, my person wholly overgrown
‚Ä≠  With all appearance of a poor old swain,
‚Ä≠  Heavy, and wretched.  If their high disdain
‚Ä≠  Of my vile presence make them my desert
‚Ä≠  Affect with contumelies, let thy lov‚Äôd heart
‚Ä≠  Beat in fix‚Äôd c√≥nfines of thy bosom still,
‚Ä≠  And see me suffer, patient of their ill.
‚Ä≠  Ay, though they drag me by the heels about
‚Ä≠  Mine own free earth, and after hurl me out,
‚Ä≠  Do thou still suffer.  Nay, though with their darts
‚Ä≠  They beat and bruise me, bear.  But these foul parts
‚Ä≠  Persuade them to forbear, and by their names
‚Ä≠  Call all with kind words; bidding, for their shames,
‚Ä≠  Their pleasures cease.  If yet they yield not way,
‚Ä≠  There breaks the first light of their fatal day.
‚Ä≠  In mean space, mark this:  When the chiefly-wise
‚Ä≠  Minerva prompts me, I‚Äôll inform thine eyes
‚Ä≠  With some giv‚Äôn sign, and then all th‚Äô arms that are
‚Ä≠  Aloft thy roof in some near room prepare
‚Ä≠  For speediest use.  If those brave men inquire
‚Ä≠  Thy end in all, still rake up all thy fire
‚Ä≠  In fair cool words, and say:  ‚ÄòI bring them down
‚Ä≠  To scour the smoke off, being so overgrown
‚Ä≠  That one would think all fumes, that ever were
‚Ä≠  Breath‚Äôd since Ulysses‚Äô loss, reflected here.
‚Ä≠  These are not like the arms he left behind,
‚Ä≠  In way for Troy.  Besides, Jove prompts my mind
‚Ä≠  In their remove apart thus with this thought,
‚Ä≠  That, if in height of wine there should be wrought,
‚Ä≠  Some harsh contention ‚Äôtwixt you, this apt mean
‚Ä≠  To mutual bloodshed may be taken clean
‚Ä≠  From out your reach, and all the spoil prevented
‚Ä≠  Of present feast, perhaps ev‚Äôn then presented
‚Ä≠  My mother‚Äôs nuptials to your long kind vows.
‚Ä≠  _Steel itself, ready, draws a man to blows.‚Äô_
‚Ä≠  Thus make their thoughts secure; to us alone
‚Ä≠  Two swords, two darts, two shields left:  which see done
‚Ä≠  Within our readiest reach, that at our will
‚Ä≠  We may resume, and charge, and all their skill
‚Ä≠  Pallas and Jove, that all just counsels breathe,
‚Ä≠  May darken with secureness to their death.
‚Ä≠  And let me charge thee now, as thou art mine,
‚Ä≠  And as thy veins mine own true blood combine:
‚Ä≠  Let, after this, none know Ulysses near,
‚Ä≠  Not anyone of all the household there,
‚Ä≠  Not here the herdsman, not Laertes be
‚Ä≠  Made privy, not herself Penelop√©
‚Ä≠  But only let thyself and me work out
‚Ä≠  The women‚Äôs thoughts of all things borne about
‚Ä≠  The Wooers‚Äô hearts; and then thy men approve,
‚Ä≠  To know who honours, who with rev‚Äôrence love,
‚Ä≠  Our well-weigh‚Äôd memories, and who is won
‚Ä≠  To fail thy fit right, though my only son.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúYou teach,‚Äù said he,  ‚Äúso punctually now,
‚Ä≠  As I knew nothing, nor were sprung from you.
‚Ä≠  I hope, hereafter, you shall better know
‚Ä≠  What soul I bear, and that it doth not let
‚Ä≠  The least loose motion pass his natural seat.
‚Ä≠  But this course you propose will prove, I fear,
‚Ä≠  Small profit to us; and could wish your care
‚Ä≠  Would weigh it better as too far about.
‚Ä≠  For time will ask much, to the sifting out
‚Ä≠  Of each man‚Äôs disposition by his deeds;
‚Ä≠  And, in the mean time, ev‚Äôry Wooer feeds
‚Ä≠  Beyond satiety, nor knows how to spare.
‚Ä≠  The women yet, since they more easy are
‚Ä≠  For our inquiry, I would wish you try,
‚Ä≠  Who right your state, who do it injury.
‚Ä≠  The men I would omit, and these things make
‚Ä≠  Your labour after.  But, to undertake
‚Ä≠  The Wooers‚Äô war, I wish your utmost speed,
‚Ä≠  Especially if you could cheer the deed
‚Ä≠  With some ostent from Jove.‚Äù  Thus, as the sire
‚Ä≠  Consented to the son, did here expire
‚Ä≠  Their mutual speech.  And now the ship was come,
‚Ä≠  That brought the young prince and his soldiers home,
‚Ä≠  The deep haven reach‚Äôd, they drew the ship ashore,
‚Ä≠  Took all their arms out, and the rich gifts bore
‚Ä≠  To Clitius‚Äô house.  But to Ulysses‚Äô court
‚Ä≠  They sent a herald first, to make report
‚Ä≠  To wise Penelop√©, that safe at field
‚Ä≠  Her son was left; yet, since the ship would yield
‚Ä≠  Most haste to her, he sent that first, and them
‚Ä≠  To comfort with his utmost the extreme
‚Ä≠  He knew she suffer‚Äôd.  At the court now met
‚Ä≠  The herald and the herdsman, to repeat
‚Ä≠  One message to the queen.  Both whom arriv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Within the gates; both to be foremost striv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In that good news.  The herald, he for haste
‚Ä≠  Amongst the maids bestow‚Äôd it, thinking plac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The queen amongst them.  ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù  said he,  ‚ÄúO queen,
‚Ä≠  Your lov‚Äôd son is arriv‚Äôd.‚Äù   And, then was seen
‚Ä≠  The queen herself, to whom the herdsman told
‚Ä≠  All that Telemachus enjoin‚Äôd he should;
‚Ä≠  All which discharg‚Äôd, his steps he back bestows,
‚Ä≠  And left both court and city for his sows.
‚Ä≠  The Wooers then grew sad; soul-vex‚Äôd, and all
‚Ä≠  Made forth the court; when, by the mighty wall
‚Ä≠  They took their sev‚Äôral seats, before the gates.
‚Ä≠  To whom Eurymachus initiates.
‚Ä≠  Their utter‚Äôd grievance.  ‚ÄúO,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúmy friends,
‚Ä≠  A work right-great begun, as proudly ends,
‚Ä≠  We said, Telemachus should never make
‚Ä≠  His voyage good, nor this shore ever take
‚Ä≠  For his return‚Äôs receipt; and yet we fail,
‚Ä≠  And he performs it.  Come, let‚Äôs man a sail,
‚Ä≠  The best In our election, and bestow
‚Ä≠  Such soldiers in her as can swiftest row,
‚Ä≠  To tell our friends that way-lay his retreat
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòTis safe perform‚Äôd, and make them quickly get
‚Ä≠  Their ship for Ithaca.‚Äù  This was not said
‚Ä≠  Before Amphinomus in port display‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The ship arriv‚Äôd, her sails then under-stroke,
‚Ä≠  And oars resum‚Äôd; when, laughing, thus he spoke:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúMove for no messenger.  These men are come,
‚Ä≠  Some God hath either told his turning home,
‚Ä≠  Or they themselves have seen his ship gone by,
‚Ä≠  Had her in chase, and lost her.‚Äù  Instantly
‚Ä≠  They rose, and went to port; found drawn to land
‚Ä≠  The ship, the soldiers taking arms in hand.
‚Ä≠  The Wooers themselves to council went in throng,
‚Ä≠  And not a man besides, or old, or young,
‚Ä≠  Let sit amongst them.  Then Eupitheus‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  Antinous, said:  ‚ÄúSee, what the Gods have done!
‚Ä≠  They only have deliver‚Äôd from our ill
‚Ä≠  The men we way-laid.  Ev‚Äôry windy hill
‚Ä≠  Hath been their watch-tow‚Äôr, where by turns they stood
‚Ä≠  Continual sentinel.  And we made good
‚Ä≠  Our work as well, for, sun once set, we never
‚Ä≠  Slept wink ashore all night, but made sail ever,
‚Ä≠  This way and that, ev‚Äôn till the morning kept
‚Ä≠  Her sacred station, so to intercept
‚Ä≠  And take his life, for whom our ambush lay;
‚Ä≠  And yet hath God to his return giv‚Äôn way.
‚Ä≠  But let us prosecute with counsels here
‚Ä≠  His necessary death, nor anywhere
‚Ä≠  Let rest his safety; for if he survive,
‚Ä≠  Our sails will never-in wish‚Äôd havens arrive;
‚Ä≠  Since he is wise, hath soul, and counsel too,
‚Ä≠  To work the people, who, will never do
‚Ä≠  Our faction favour.  What we then intend
‚Ä≠  Against his person, give we present end,
‚Ä≠  Before he call a council, which, believe,
‚Ä≠  His spirit will haste, and point where it doth grieve,
‚Ä≠  Stand up amongst them all, and urge his death
‚Ä≠  Decreed amongst us.  Which complaint will breathe
‚Ä≠  A fire about their spleens, and blow no praise
‚Ä≠  On our ill labours.  Lest, they therefore raise
‚Ä≠  Pow‚Äôr to exile us from our native earth,
‚Ä≠  And force our lives‚Äô societies to the birth
‚Ä≠  Of foreign countries, let our speeds prevent,
‚Ä≠  His coming home to this austere complaint,
‚Ä≠  At field and far from town, or in some way
‚Ä≠  Of narrow passage, with his latest day
‚Ä≠  Shown to his forward youth, his goods and lands
‚Ä≠  Left to the free division of our hands,
‚Ä≠  The moveables made all his mother‚Äôs dow‚Äôr,
‚Ä≠  And his, whoever Fate affords the pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  To celebrate, with her sweet Hymen‚Äôs rites.
‚Ä≠  Or if this please not, but your appetites
‚Ä≠  Stand to his safety, and to give him seat
‚Ä≠  In his whole birth-right, let us look to eat
‚Ä≠  At his cost never more, but ev‚Äôry man
‚Ä≠  Haste to his home, and wed, with whom he can
‚Ä≠  At home, and there lay first about for dow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  And then the woman give his second pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  Of nuptial-liking, and, for last, apply
‚Ä≠  His purpose with most gifts and destiny.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This silence caus‚Äôd; whose breach, at last, begun
‚Ä≠  Amphinomus, the much renown√©d son
‚Ä≠  Of Nisus surnam‚Äôd Aretiades,
‚Ä≠  Who from Dulichius full of flow‚Äôry leas
‚Ä≠  Led all the Wooers, and in chief did please
‚Ä≠  The queen with his discourse, because it grew
‚Ä≠  From roots of those good minds that did endue  [4]
‚Ä≠  His goodly person; who, exceeding wise,
‚Ä≠  Us‚Äôd this speech:  ‚ÄúFriends, I never will advise
‚Ä≠  The prince‚Äôs death; for ‚Äôtis a damn√©d thing
‚Ä≠  To put to death the issue of a king.
‚Ä≠  First, therefore, let‚Äôs examine, what applause
‚Ä≠  The Gods will give it:  If the equal laws
‚Ä≠  Of Jove approve it, I myself will be
‚Ä≠  The man shall kill him, and this company
‚Ä≠  Exhort to that mind:  If the Gods remain
‚Ä≠  Adverse, and hate it, I advise, refrain.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said Amphinomus, and pleas‚Äôd them all
‚Ä≠  When all arose, and in Ulysses‚Äô hall
‚Ä≠  Took seat again.  Then to the queen was come
‚Ä≠  The Wooers‚Äô plot, to kill her son at home,
‚Ä≠  Since their abroad-design had miss‚Äôd success,
‚Ä≠  The herald Medon (who the whole address
‚Ä≠  Knew of their counsels) making the report.
‚Ä≠  The Goddess of her sex, with her fair sort
‚Ä≠  Of lovely women, at the large hall‚Äôs door
‚Ä≠  (Her bright cheeks clouded with a veil she wore)
‚Ä≠  Stood, and directed to Antinous
‚Ä≠  Her sharp reproof, which she digested thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAntinous!  Compos‚Äôd of injury!
‚Ä≠  Plotter of mischief!  Though reports that fly
‚Ä≠  Amongst our Ithacensian people say
‚Ä≠  That thou, of all that glory in their sway,
‚Ä≠  Art best in words and counsels, th‚Äô art not so.
‚Ä≠  Fond, busy fellow, why plott‚Äôst thou the woe
‚Ä≠  And slaughter of my son, and dost not fear
‚Ä≠  The presidents of suppliants, when the ear
‚Ä≠  Of Jove stoops to them?  ‚ÄôTis unjust to do
‚Ä≠  Slaughter for slaughter, or pay woe for woe,
‚Ä≠  Mischief for kindness.  Death for life sought, then,
‚Ä≠  Is an injustice to be loath‚Äôd of men.
‚Ä≠  Serves not thy knowledge to remember when
‚Ä≠  Thy father fled to us?  Who (mov‚Äôd to wrath
‚Ä≠  Against the Taphian thieves) pursued with scathe
‚Ä≠  The guiltless Thesprots; in whose people‚Äôs fear,
‚Ä≠  Pursuing him for wreak, he landed here,
‚Ä≠  They after him, professing both their prize
‚Ä≠  Of all his chiefly-valued faculties,
‚Ä≠  And more priz‚Äôd life.  Of all whose bloodiest ends
‚Ä≠  Ulysses curb‚Äôd them, though they were his friends.
‚Ä≠  Yet thou, like one that no law will allow
‚Ä≠  The least true honour, eat‚Äôst his house up now
‚Ä≠  That fed thy father; woo‚Äôst for love his wife,
‚Ä≠  Whom thus thou griev‚Äôst and seek‚Äôst her sole son‚Äôs life!
‚Ä≠  Cease, I command thee, and command the rest
‚Ä≠  To see all thought of these foul fashions ceas‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Eurymachus replied:  ‚ÄúBe confident,
‚Ä≠  Thou all-of-wit-made, the most fam‚Äôd descent
‚Ä≠  Of king Icarius.  Free thy spirits of fear.
‚Ä≠  There lives not anyone, nor shall live here
‚Ä≠  Now, nor hereafter, while my life gives heat
‚Ä≠  And light to me on earth, that dares intreat
‚Ä≠  With any ill touch thy well-lov√©d son,
‚Ä≠  But here I vow, and here will see it done,
‚Ä≠  His life shall stain my lance.  If on his knees
‚Ä≠  The city-racer, Laertiades,
‚Ä≠  Hath made me sit, put in my hand his food,
‚Ä≠  And held his red wine to me, shall the blood
‚Ä≠  Of his Telemachus on my hand lay
‚Ä≠  The least pollution, that my life can stay?
‚Ä≠  No!  I have ever charg‚Äôd him not to fear
‚Ä≠  Death‚Äôs threat from any.  And, for that most dear
‚Ä≠  Love of his father, he shall ever be
‚Ä≠  Much the most lov‚Äôd of all that live to me.
‚Ä≠  _Who kills a guiltless man from man may fly,
‚Ä≠  From God his searches all escapes deny.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     Thus cheer‚Äôd his words, but his affections still
‚Ä≠  Fear‚Äôd not to cherish foul intent to kill
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn him whose life to all lives he preferr‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     The queen went up, and to her love appear‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Her lord so freshly, that she wept, till sleep
‚Ä≠  (By Pallas forc‚Äôd on her) her eyes did steep
‚Ä≠  In his sweet humour.  When the even was come,
‚Ä≠  The God-like herdsman reach‚Äôd the whole way home.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses and his son for supper drest
‚Ä≠  A year-old swine, and ere their host and guest
‚Ä≠  Had got their presence, Pallas had put by
‚Ä≠  With her fair rod Ulysses‚Äô royalty,
‚Ä≠  And render‚Äôd him an aged man again,
‚Ä≠  With all his vile integuments, lest his swain
‚Ä≠  Should know him in his trim, and tell his queen,
‚Ä≠  In these deep secrets being not deeply seen.
‚Ä≠     He seen, to him the prince these words did use:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúWelcome divine Eum√¶us!  Now what news
‚Ä≠  Employs the city?  Are the Wooers come
‚Ä≠  Back from their scout dismay‚Äôd?  Or here at home
‚Ä≠  Will they again attempt me?‚Äù  He replied:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThese touch not my care.  I was satisfied
‚Ä≠  To do, with most speed, what I went to do;
‚Ä≠  My message done, return.  And yet, not so
‚Ä≠  Came my news first; a herald (met with there)
‚Ä≠  Forestall‚Äôd my tale, and told how safe you were.
‚Ä≠  Besides which merely necessary thing,
‚Ä≠  What in my way chanc‚Äôd I may over-bring,
‚Ä≠  Being what I know, and witness‚Äôd with mine eyes.
‚Ä≠     Where the Herm√¶an sepulchre doth rise
‚Ä≠  Above the city, I beheld take port
‚Ä≠  A ship, and in her many a man of sort;
‚Ä≠  Her freight was shields and lances; and, methought,
‚Ä≠  They were the Wooers; but, of knowledge, nought
‚Ä≠  Can therein tell you.‚Äù  The prince smil‚Äôd, and knew
‚Ä≠  They were the Wooers, casting secret view
‚Ä≠  Upon his father.  But what they intended
‚Ä≠  Fled far the herdsman; whose swain‚Äôs labours ended,
‚Ä≠  They dress‚Äôd the supper, which, past want, was eat.
‚Ä≠  When all desire suffic‚Äôd of wine and meat,
‚Ä≠  Of other human wants they took supplies
‚Ä≠  At Sleep‚Äôs soft hand, who sweetly clos‚Äôd their eyes.

‚Ä≠  THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Telemachus, return‚Äôd to town,
‚Ä≠  Makes to his curious mother known,
‚Ä≠  In part, his travels.  After whom
‚Ä≠  Ulysses to the court doth come,
‚Ä≠  In good Eum√¶us‚Äô guide, and prest
‚Ä≠  To witness of the Wooers‚Äô feast;
‚Ä≠  Whom, though twice ten years did bestow
‚Ä≠  In far-off parts, his dog doth know.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _Œ°œâÃë._
‚Ä≠     Ulysses shows
‚Ä≠        Through all disguise.
‚Ä≠     Whom his dog knows;
‚Ä≠        Who knowing dies.

‚Ä≠  But when air‚Äôs rosy birth, the morn, arose,
‚Ä≠  Telemachus did for the town dispose
‚Ä≠  His early steps; and took to his command
‚Ä≠  His fair long lance, well-sorting with his hand,
‚Ä≠  Thus parting with Eum√¶us:  ‚ÄúNow, my friend,
‚Ä≠  I must to town, lest too far I extend
‚Ä≠  My mother‚Äôs moan for me, who, till her eyes
‚Ä≠  Mine own eyes witness, varies tears and cries
‚Ä≠  Through all extremes.  Do then this charge of mine,
‚Ä≠  And guide to town this hapless guest of thine,
‚Ä≠  To beg elsewhere his further festival.
‚Ä≠  Give they that please, I cannot give to all,
‚Ä≠  Mine own wants take up for myself my pain.
‚Ä≠  If it incense him, he the worst shall gain.
‚Ä≠  The lovely truth I love, and must be plain.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAlas, friend,‚Äù  said his father,  ‚Äúnor do I
‚Ä≠  Desire at all your further charity.
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòTis better beg in cities than in fields,
‚Ä≠  And take the worst a beggar‚Äôs fortune yields.
‚Ä≠  Nor am I apt to stay in swine-styes more,
‚Ä≠  However; ever the great chief before
‚Ä≠  The poor ranks must to ev‚Äôry step obey.
‚Ä≠  But go; your man in my command shall sway,
‚Ä≠  Anon yet too, by favour, when your fires
‚Ä≠  Have comforted the cold heat age expires,
‚Ä≠  And when the sun‚Äôs flame hath besides corrected
‚Ä≠  The early air abroad, not being protected
‚Ä≠  By these my bare weeds from the morning‚Äôs frost,
‚Ä≠  Which (if so much ground is to be engrost
‚Ä≠  By my poor feet as you report) may give
‚Ä≠  Too violent charge to th‚Äô heat by which I live.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, his son went on with spritely pace,
‚Ä≠  And to the Wooers studied little grace.
‚Ä≠  Arriv‚Äôd at home, he gave his jav‚Äôlin stay
‚Ä≠  Against a lofty pillar, and bold way
‚Ä≠  Made further in.  When having so far gone
‚Ä≠  That he transcended the fair porch of stone,
‚Ä≠  The first by far that gave his entry eye
‚Ä≠  Was nurse Euryclea;  who th‚Äô embrodery
‚Ä≠  Of stools there set was giving cushions fair;
‚Ä≠  Who ran upon him, and her rapt repair
‚Ä≠  Shed tears for joy.  About him gather‚Äôd round
‚Ä≠  The other maids; his head and shoulders crown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With kisses and embraces.  From above
‚Ä≠  The Queen herself came, like the Queen of Love,
‚Ä≠  Or bright Diana; cast about her son
‚Ä≠  Her kind embraces, with effusi√≥n
‚Ä≠  Of loving tears; kiss‚Äôd both his lovely eyes,
‚Ä≠  His cheeks, and forehead; and gave all supplies
‚Ä≠  With this entreaty;  ‚ÄúWelcome, sweetest light!
‚Ä≠  I never had conceit to set quick sight
‚Ä≠  On thee thus soon, when thy lov‚Äôd father‚Äôs fame
‚Ä≠  As far as Pylos did thy spirit inflame,
‚Ä≠  In that search ventur‚Äôd all-unknown to me.
‚Ä≠  O say, by what pow‚Äôr cam‚Äôst thou now to be
‚Ä≠  Mine eyes‚Äô dear object?‚Äù  He return‚Äôd reply:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúMove me not now, when you my ‚Äôscape descry
‚Ä≠  From imminent death, to think me fresh entrapt;
‚Ä≠  The fear‚Äôd wound rubbing, felt before I ‚Äôscapt.
‚Ä≠  Double not needless passion on a heart
‚Ä≠  Whose joy so green is, and so apt t‚Äô invert;
‚Ä≠  But pure weeds putting on, ascend and take
‚Ä≠  Your women with you, that ye all may make
‚Ä≠  Vows of full hecatombs in sacred fire
‚Ä≠  To all the Godheads, if their only Sire
‚Ä≠  Vouchsafe revenge of guest-rites wrong‚Äôd, which he
‚Ä≠  Is to protect as being their Deity.
‚Ä≠  My way shall be directed to the hall
‚Ä≠  Of common concourse, that I thence may call
‚Ä≠  A stranger, who from off the Pylian shore
‚Ä≠  Came friendly with me; whom I sent before
‚Ä≠  With all my soldiers, but in chief did charge
‚Ä≠  Pir√¶us with him, wishing him t‚Äô enlarge
‚Ä≠  His love to him at home, in best affair,
‚Ä≠  And utmost honours, till mine own repair.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Her son thus spoken, his words could not bear
‚Ä≠  The wings too easily through her either ear,
‚Ä≠  But putting pure weeds on, made vows entire
‚Ä≠  Of perfect hecatombs in sacred fire
‚Ä≠  To all the Deities, if their only Sire
‚Ä≠  Vouchsaf‚Äôd revenge of guest-rites wrong‚Äôd, which he
‚Ä≠  Was to protect as being their Deity.
‚Ä≠     Her son left house, in his fair hand his lance,
‚Ä≠  His dogs attending; and, on ev‚Äôry glance
‚Ä≠  His looks cast from them, Pallas put a grace
‚Ä≠  That made him seem of the celestial race.
‚Ä≠  Whom, come to concourse, ev‚Äôry man admir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  About him throng‚Äôd the Wooers, and desir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  All good to him in tongues, but in their hearts
‚Ä≠  Most deep ills threaten‚Äôd to his most deserts.
‚Ä≠  Of whose huge rout once free, he cast glad eye
‚Ä≠  On some that, long before his infancy,
‚Ä≠  Were with his father great and gracious,
‚Ä≠  Grave Halitherses, Mentor, Antiphus:
‚Ä≠  To whom he went, took seat by them, and they
‚Ä≠  Inquir‚Äôd of all things since his parting day.
‚Ä≠  To them Pir√¶us came, and brought his guest
‚Ä≠  Along the city thither, whom not least
‚Ä≠  The prince respected, nor was long before
‚Ä≠  He rose and met him.  The first word yet bore
‚Ä≠  Pir√¶us from them both; whose haste besought
‚Ä≠  The prince to send his women to see brought
‚Ä≠  The gifts from his house that Atrides gave,
‚Ä≠  Which his own roofs, he thought, would better save.
‚Ä≠     The wise prince answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúI can scarce conceive
‚Ä≠  The way to these works.  If the Wooers reave
‚Ä≠  By privy stratagem my life at home,
‚Ä≠  I rather wish Pir√¶us may become
‚Ä≠  The master of them, than the best of these.
‚Ä≠  But, if I sow in their fields of excess
‚Ä≠  Slaughter and ruin, then thy trust employ,
‚Ä≠  And to me joying bring thou those with joy.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he brought home his grief-practis‚Äôd guest;
‚Ä≠  Where both put off, both oil‚Äôd, and did invest
‚Ä≠  Themselves in rich robes, wash‚Äôd, and sate, and eat.
‚Ä≠  His mother, in a fair chair taking seat
‚Ä≠  Directly opposite, her loom applied;
‚Ä≠  Who, when her son and guest had satisfied
‚Ä≠  Their appetites with feast, said:  ‚ÄúO my son,
‚Ä≠  You know that ever since your sire was won
‚Ä≠  To go in Agamemnon‚Äôs guide to Troy,
‚Ä≠  Attempting sleep, I never did enjoy
‚Ä≠  One night‚Äôs good rest, but made my quiet bed
‚Ä≠  A sea blown-up with sighs, with tears still shed
‚Ä≠  Embrew‚Äôd and troubled; yet, though all your miss
‚Ä≠  In your late voyage hath been made for this,
‚Ä≠  That you might know th‚Äô abode your father made.
‚Ä≠  You shun to tell me what success you had.
‚Ä≠  Now then, before the insolent access
‚Ä≠  The Wooers straight will force on us, express
‚Ä≠  What you have heard.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI will,‚Äù said he,  ‚Äúand true.
‚Ä≠  We came to Pylos, where the studious due
‚Ä≠  That any father could afford his son,
‚Ä≠  (But new-arriv‚Äôd from some course he had run
‚Ä≠  To an extreme length, in some voyage vow‚Äôd),
‚Ä≠  Nestor, the pastor of the people, show‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To me arriv‚Äôd, in turrets thrust-up high,
‚Ä≠  Where not his brave sons were more lov‚Äôd than I.
‚Ä≠  Yet of th‚Äô unconquer‚Äôd ever-sufferer;
‚Ä≠  Ulysses, never he could set his ear,
‚Ä≠  Alive or dead, from any earthy man.
‚Ä≠  But to the great Laced√¶monian,
‚Ä≠  Atrides, famous for his lance, he sent,
‚Ä≠  With horse and chariots, me, to learn th‚Äô event
‚Ä≠  From his relation; where I had the view
‚Ä≠  Of Argive Helen, whose strong beauties drew,
‚Ä≠  By wills of Gods, so many Grecian states,
‚Ä≠  And Trojans, under such laborious fates.
‚Ä≠  Where Menelaus ask‚Äôd me, what affair
‚Ä≠  To Laced√¶mon render‚Äôd my repair.
‚Ä≠  I told him all the truth, who made reply:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòO deed of most abhorr‚Äôd indecency!
‚Ä≠  A sort of impotents attempt his bed
‚Ä≠  Whose strength of mind hath cities levell√©d!
‚Ä≠  As to a lion‚Äôs den, when any hind
‚Ä≠  Hath brought her young calves, to their rest inclin‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  When he is ranging hills, and herby dales,
‚Ä≠  To make of feeders there his festivals,
‚Ä≠  But, turning to his luster, calves and dam
‚Ä≠  He shows abhorr‚Äôd death, in his anger‚Äôs flame;
‚Ä≠  So, should Ulysses find this rabble hous‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In his free turrets, courting his espous‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Foul death would fall them.  O, I would to Jove,
‚Ä≠  Ph≈ìbus, and Pallas, that, when he shall prove
‚Ä≠  The broad report of his exhausted store
‚Ä≠  True with his eyes, his nerves and sinews wore
‚Ä≠  That vigour then that in the Lesbian tow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  Provok‚Äôd to wrastle with the iron pow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  Philomelides vaunted, he approv‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  When down he hurl‚Äôd his challenger, and mov‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Huge shouts from all the Achives then in view.
‚Ä≠  If, once come home, he all those forces drew
‚Ä≠  About him there to work, they all were dead,
‚Ä≠  And should find bitter his attempted bed.
‚Ä≠  But what you ask and sue for, I, as far
‚Ä≠  As I have heard the true-spoke mariner,
‚Ä≠  Will tell directly, nor delude your ear:
‚Ä≠  He told me that an island did ensphere,
‚Ä≠  In much discomfort, great Laertes‚Äô son;
‚Ä≠  And that the Nymph Calypso, overrun
‚Ä≠  With his affection, kept him in her caves,
‚Ä≠  Where men, nor ship, of pow‚Äôr to brook the waves,
‚Ä≠  Were near his convoy to his country‚Äôs shore,
‚Ä≠  And where herself importun‚Äôd evermore
‚Ä≠  His quiet stay; which not obtain‚Äôd, by force
‚Ä≠  She kept his person from all else recourse.‚Äô
‚Ä≠     This told Atrides, which was all he knew.
‚Ä≠  Nor stay‚Äôd I more, but from the Gods there blew
‚Ä≠  A prosp‚Äôrous wind, that set me quickly here.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This put his mother quite from all her cheer.
‚Ä≠  When Theoclymenus the augur said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO woman, honour‚Äôd with Ulysses‚Äô bed,
‚Ä≠  Your son, no doubt, knows clearly nothing more,
‚Ä≠  Hear me yet speak, that can the truth uncore,
‚Ä≠  Nor will be curious.  Jove then witness bear,
‚Ä≠  And this thy hospitable table here,
‚Ä≠  With this whole household of your blameless lord,
‚Ä≠  That at this hour his royal feet are shor‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  On his lov‚Äôd country-earth, and that ev‚Äôn here
‚Ä≠  Coming, or creeping, he will see the cheer
‚Ä≠  These Wooers make, and in his soul‚Äôs field sow
‚Ä≠  Seeds that shall thrive to all their overthrow.
‚Ä≠  This, set a ship-board, I knew sorted thus,
‚Ä≠  And cried it out to your Telemachus.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Penelop√© replied:  ‚ÄúWould this would prove,
‚Ä≠  You well should witness a most friendly love,
‚Ä≠  And gifts such of me, as encount‚Äôring Fame
‚Ä≠  Should greet you with a bless√©d mortal‚Äôs name.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This mutual speech past, all the Wooers were
‚Ä≠  Hurling the stone, and tossing of the spear,
‚Ä≠  Before the palace, in the pav√©d court,
‚Ä≠  Where otherwhiles their petulant resort
‚Ä≠  Sat plotting injuries.  But when the hour
‚Ä≠  Of supper enter‚Äôd, and the feeding pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  Brought sheep from field, that fill‚Äôd up ev‚Äôry way
‚Ä≠  With those that us‚Äôd to furnish that purvey,
‚Ä≠  Medon, the herald (who of all the rest
‚Ä≠  Pleas‚Äôd most the Wooers, and at ev‚Äôry feast
‚Ä≠  Was ever near) said:  ‚ÄúYou whose kind consort
‚Ä≠  Make the fair branches of the tree our court,
‚Ä≠  Grace it within now, and your suppers take.
‚Ä≠  You that for health, and fair contention‚Äôs sake,
‚Ä≠  Will please your minds, know, bodies must have meat;
‚Ä≠  _Play‚Äôs worse than idleness in times to eat.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     This said, all left, came in, cast by, on thrones
‚Ä≠  And chairs, their garments.  Their provisi√≥ns
‚Ä≠  Were sheep, swine, goats, the chiefly-great and fat,
‚Ä≠  Besides an ox that from the herd they gat.
‚Ä≠  And now the king and herdsman, from the field,
‚Ä≠  In good way were to town; ‚Äôtwixt whom was held
‚Ä≠  Some walking conference, which thus begun
‚Ä≠  The good Eum√¶us:  ‚ÄúGuest, your will was won,
‚Ä≠  Because the prince commanded, to make way
‚Ä≠  Up to the city, though I wish‚Äôd your stay,
‚Ä≠  And to have made you guardian of my stall;
‚Ä≠  But I, in care and fear of what might fall
‚Ä≠  In after-anger of the prince, forbore.
‚Ä≠  _The checks of princes touch their subjects sore._
‚Ä≠  But make we haste, the day is nearly ended,
‚Ä≠  And cold airs still are in the even extended.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI know‚Äôt,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúconsider all; your charge
‚Ä≠  Is giv‚Äôn to one that understands at large.
‚Ä≠  Haste then.  Hereafter, you shall lead the way;
‚Ä≠  Afford your staff too, if it fit your stay,
‚Ä≠  That I may use it; since you say our pass
‚Ä≠  Is less friend to a weak foot than it was.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus cast he on his neck his nasty scrip,
‚Ä≠  All-patch‚Äôd and torn; a cord, that would not slip
‚Ä≠  For knots and bracks about the mouth of it,
‚Ä≠  Made serve the turn; and then his swain did fit
‚Ä≠  His forc‚Äôd state with a staff.  Then plied they hard
‚Ä≠  Their way to town, their cottage left in guard
‚Ä≠  To swains and dogs.  And now Eum√¶us led
‚Ä≠  The king along, his garments to a thread
‚Ä≠  All-bare and burn‚Äôd, and he himself hard bore
‚Ä≠  Upon his staff, at all parts like a poor
‚Ä≠  And sad old beggar.  But when now they got
‚Ä≠  The rough highway, their voyage wanted not
‚Ä≠  Much of the city, where a fount they reach‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  From whence the town their choicest water fetch‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  That ever overflow‚Äôd, and curious art
‚Ä≠  Was shown about it; in which three had part
‚Ä≠  Whose names Neritus and Polyctor were,
‚Ä≠  And famous Ithacus.  It had a sphere
‚Ä≠  Of poplar, that ran round about the wall;
‚Ä≠  And into it a lofty rock let fall
‚Ä≠  Continual supply of cool clear stream.
‚Ä≠  On whose top, to the Nymphs that were supreme
‚Ä≠  In those parts‚Äô loves, a stately altar rose,
‚Ä≠  Where ev‚Äôry traveller did still impose
‚Ä≠  Devoted sacrifice.  At this fount found
‚Ä≠  These silly travellers a man renown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  For guard of goats, which now he had in guide,
‚Ä≠  Whose huge-stor‚Äôd herd two herdsmen kept beside,
‚Ä≠  For all herds it excell‚Äôd, and bred a feed
‚Ä≠  For Wooers only.  He was Dolius‚Äô seed,
‚Ä≠  And call‚Äôd Melanthius.  Who casting eye
‚Ä≠  On these two there, he chid them terribly,
‚Ä≠  And so past mean, that ev‚Äôn the wretched fate
‚Ä≠  Now on Ulysses he did irritate.
‚Ä≠  His fume to this effect he did pursue:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúWhy so,‚Äôtis now at all parts passing true,
‚Ä≠  That ill leads ill, good evermore doth train
‚Ä≠  With like his like.  Why, thou unenvied swain,
‚Ä≠  Whither dost thou lead this same victless leaguer,
‚Ä≠  This bane of banquets, this most nasty beggar,
‚Ä≠  Whose sight doth make one sad, it so abhors?
‚Ä≠  Who, with his standing in so many doors,
‚Ä≠  Hath broke his back; and all his beggary tends
‚Ä≠  To beg base crusts, but to no manly ends,
‚Ä≠  As asking swords, or with activity
‚Ä≠  To get a caldron.  Wouldst thou give him me,
‚Ä≠  To farm my stable, or to sweep my yard,
‚Ä≠  And bring browse to my kids, and that preferr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  He should be at my keeping for his pains
‚Ä≠  To drink as much whey as his thirsty veins
‚Ä≠  Would still be swilling (whey made all his fees)
‚Ä≠  His monstrous belly would oppress his knees.
‚Ä≠  But he hath learn‚Äôd to lead base life about,
‚Ä≠  And will not work, but crouch among the rout
‚Ä≠  For broken meat to cram his bursten gut.
‚Ä≠  Yet this I‚Äôll say, and he will find it put
‚Ä≠  In sure effect, that if he enters where
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô roofs cast shade, the stools will there
‚Ä≠  About his ears fly, all the house will throw,
‚Ä≠  And rub his ragged sides with cuffs enow.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Past these reviles, his manless rudeness spurn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Divine Ulysses; who at no part turn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His face from him, but had his spirit fed
‚Ä≠  With these two thoughts, if he should strike him dead
‚Ä≠  With his bestow√©d staff, or at his feet
‚Ä≠  Make his direct head and the pavement meet.
‚Ä≠  But he bore all, and entertain‚Äôd a breast
‚Ä≠  That in the strife of all extremes did rest.
‚Ä≠     Eum√¶us, frowning on him, chid him yet,
‚Ä≠  And, lifting up his hands to heav‚Äôn, he set
‚Ä≠  This bitter curse at him:  ‚ÄúO you that bear
‚Ä≠  Fair name to be the race of Jupiter,
‚Ä≠  Nymphs of these fountains!  If Ulysses ever
‚Ä≠  Burn‚Äôd thighs to you, that, hid in fat, did never
‚Ä≠  Fail your acceptance, of or lamb or kid,
‚Ä≠  Grant this grace to me:  Let the man thus hid
‚Ä≠  Shine through his dark fate, make some God his guide,
‚Ä≠  That, to thee, goatherd, this same palate‚Äôs pride,  [1]
‚Ä≠  Thou driv‚Äôst afore thee, he may come and make
‚Ä≠  The scatt‚Äôrings of the earth, and overtake
‚Ä≠  Thy wrongs, with forcing thee to ever err
‚Ä≠  About the city, hunted by his fear.
‚Ä≠  And in the mean space by some slothful swains
‚Ä≠  Let lousy sickness gnaw thy cattle‚Äôs veins.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO Gods!‚Äù  replied Melanthius,  ‚Äúwhat a curse
‚Ä≠  Hath this dog bark‚Äôd out, and can yet do worse!
‚Ä≠  This man shall I have giv‚Äôn into my hands,
‚Ä≠  When in a well-built ship to far-off lands
‚Ä≠  I shall transport him, that, should I want here,
‚Ä≠  My sale of him may find me victuals there.
‚Ä≠  And, for Ulysses, would to heav‚Äôn his joy
‚Ä≠  The silver-bearing-bow God would destroy,
‚Ä≠  This day, within his house, as sure as he
‚Ä≠  The day of his return shall never see.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he left them going silent on;
‚Ä≠  But he out-went them, and took straight upon
‚Ä≠  The palace-royal, which he enter‚Äôd straight,
‚Ä≠  Sat with the Wooers, and his trencher‚Äôs freight
‚Ä≠  The carvers gave him of the flesh there vented,
‚Ä≠  But bread the rev‚Äôrend butleress presented.
‚Ä≠  He took against Eurymachus his place,
‚Ä≠  Who most of all the Wooers gave him grace.
‚Ä≠  And now Ulysses and his swain got near,
‚Ä≠  When round about them visited their ear
‚Ä≠  The hollow harp‚Äôs delicious-stricken string,
‚Ä≠  To which did Phemius, near the Wooers, sing.
‚Ä≠     Then by the hand Ulysses took his swain,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúEum√¶us, one may here see plain,
‚Ä≠  In many a grace, that Laertiades
‚Ä≠  Built here these turrets, and,‚Äômongst others these,
‚Ä≠  His whole court arm‚Äôd with such a goodly wall,
‚Ä≠  The cornice, and the cope, majestical,
‚Ä≠  His double gates, and turrets, built too strong
‚Ä≠  For force or virtue ever to expugn.
‚Ä≠  I know the feasters in it now abound,
‚Ä≠  Their cates cast such a savour; and the sound
‚Ä≠  The harp gives argues an accomplish‚Äôd feast.
‚Ä≠  _The Gods made music banquet‚Äôs dearest guest.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúThese things,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúyour skill may tell with ease,
‚Ä≠  Since you are grac‚Äôd with greater knowledges.
‚Ä≠  But now consult we how these works shall sort,
‚Ä≠  If you will first approach this prais√©d court,
‚Ä≠  And see these Wooers, I remaining here;
‚Ä≠  Or I shall enter, and yourself forbear?
‚Ä≠  But be not you too tedious in your stay,
‚Ä≠  Lest thrust ye be and buffeted away.
‚Ä≠  _Brain hath no fence for blows;_ look to ‚Äôt I pray.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúYou speak to one that comprehends,‚Äù said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúGo you before, and here adventure me.
‚Ä≠  I have of old been us‚Äôd to cuffs and blows;
‚Ä≠  My mind is harden‚Äôd, having borne the throes
‚Ä≠  Of many a sour event in waves and wars,
‚Ä≠  Where knocks and buffets are no foreigners.
‚Ä≠  And this same harmful belly by no mean
‚Ä≠  The greatest abstinent can ever wean.
‚Ä≠  _Men suffer much bane by the belly‚Äôs rage;_
‚Ä≠  For whose sake ships in all their equipage
‚Ä≠  Are arm‚Äôd, and set out to th‚Äô untamed seas,
‚Ä≠  Their bulks full-fraught with ills to enemies.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Such speech they chang‚Äôd; when in the yard there lay
‚Ä≠  A dog, call‚Äôd Argus, which, before his way
‚Ä≠  Assum‚Äôd for Ilion, Ulysses bred,
‚Ä≠  Yet stood his pleasure then in little stead,
‚Ä≠  As being too young, but, growing to his grace,
‚Ä≠  Young men made choice of him for ev‚Äôry chace,
‚Ä≠  Or of their wild goats, of their hares, or harts.
‚Ä≠  But his king gone, and he, now past his parts,
‚Ä≠  Lay all abjectly on the stable‚Äôs store,
‚Ä≠  Before the oxstall, and mules‚Äô stable door,
‚Ä≠  To keep the clothes cast from the peasants‚Äô hands,
‚Ä≠  While they laid compass on Ulysses‚Äô lands,
‚Ä≠  The dog, with ticks (unlook‚Äôd-to) overgrown.
‚Ä≠  But by this dog no sooner seen but known
‚Ä≠  Was wise Ulysses, who new-enter‚Äôd there,
‚Ä≠  Up went his dog‚Äôs laid ears, and, coming near,
‚Ä≠  Up he himself rose, fawn‚Äôd, and wagg‚Äôd his stern,
‚Ä≠  Couch‚Äôd close his ears, and lay so; nor discern  [2]
‚Ä≠  Could evermore his dear-lov‚Äôd lord again.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses saw it, nor had pow‚Äôr t‚Äô abstain
‚Ä≠  From shedding tears; which (far-off seeing his swain)
‚Ä≠  He dried from his sight clean; to whom he thus
‚Ä≠  His grief dissembled:  ‚Äú‚ÄôTis miraculous,
‚Ä≠  That such a dog as this should have his lair
‚Ä≠  On such a dunghill, for his form is fair.
‚Ä≠  And yet, I know not, if there were in him
‚Ä≠  Good pace, or parts, for all his goodly limb;
‚Ä≠  Or he liv‚Äôd empty of those inward things,
‚Ä≠  As are those trencher-beagles tending kings,
‚Ä≠  Whom for their pleasure‚Äôs, or their glory‚Äôs, sake,
‚Ä≠  Or fashion, they into their favour take.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúThis dog,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúwas servant to one dead
‚Ä≠  A huge time since.  But if he bore his head,
‚Ä≠  For form and quality, of such a height,
‚Ä≠  As when Ulysses, bound for th‚Äô Ilion fight,
‚Ä≠  Or quickly after, left him, your rapt eyes
‚Ä≠  Would then admire to see him use his thighs
‚Ä≠  In strength and swiftness.  He would nothing fly,
‚Ä≠  Nor anything let ‚Äôscape.  If once his eye
‚Ä≠  Seiz‚Äôd any wild beast, he knew straight his scent;
‚Ä≠  Go where he would, away with him he went.
‚Ä≠  Nor was there ever any savage stood
‚Ä≠  Amongst the thickets of the deepest wood
‚Ä≠  Long time before him, but he pull‚Äôd him down;
‚Ä≠  As well by that true hunting to be shown
‚Ä≠  In such vast coverts, as for speed of pace
‚Ä≠  In any open lawn.  For in deep chace
‚Ä≠  He was a passing-wise and well-nos‚Äôd hound.
‚Ä≠  And yet is all this good in him uncrown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With any grace here now, nor he more fed
‚Ä≠  Than any errant cur.  His king is dead,
‚Ä≠  Far from his country; and his servants are
‚Ä≠  So negligent they lend his hound no care.
‚Ä≠  _Where masters rule not, but let men alone,
‚Ä≠  You never there see honest service done.
‚Ä≠  That man‚Äôs half-virtue Jove takes quite away,
‚Ä≠  That once is sun-burnt with the servile day.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     This said, he enter‚Äôd the well-builded-tow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  Up bearing right upon the glorious Wooers,
‚Ä≠  And left poor Argus dead; his lord‚Äôs first sight
‚Ä≠  Since that time twenty years bereft his light.
‚Ä≠     Telemachus did far the first behold
‚Ä≠  Eum√¶us enter, and made signs he should
‚Ä≠  Come up to him.  He, noting, came, and took
‚Ä≠  On earth his seat.  And then the master-cook
‚Ä≠  Serv‚Äôd in more banquet; of which, part he set
‚Ä≠  Before the Wooers, part the prince did get,
‚Ä≠  Who sate alone, his table plac‚Äôd aside;
‚Ä≠  To which the herald did the bread divide.
‚Ä≠     After Eum√¶us, enter‚Äôd straight the king,  [3]
‚Ä≠  Like to a poor and heavy aged thing,
‚Ä≠  Bore hard upon his staff, and was so clad
‚Ä≠  As would have made his mere beholder sad.
‚Ä≠  Upon the ashen floor his limbs he spread,
‚Ä≠  And ‚Äôgainst a cypress-threshold stay‚Äôd his head,
‚Ä≠  The tree wrought smooth, and in a line direct
‚Ä≠  Tried by the plumb and by the architect.
‚Ä≠  The prince then bade the herdsman give him bread,
‚Ä≠  The finest there, and see that prostrated
‚Ä≠  At-all-parts plight of his giv‚Äôn all the cheer
‚Ä≠  His hands could turn to:  ‚ÄúTake,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúand bear
‚Ä≠  These cates to him, and bid him beg of all
‚Ä≠  These Wooers here, and to their festival
‚Ä≠  Bear up with all the impudence he can;
‚Ä≠  _Bashful behaviour fits no needy man.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     He heard, and did his will.  ‚ÄúHold guest,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúTelemachus commends these cates to thee,
‚Ä≠  Bids thee bear up, and all these Wooers implore.
‚Ä≠  _Wit must make impudent whom Fate makes poor.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO Jove,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúdo my poor pray‚Äôrs the grace
‚Ä≠  To make him blessed‚Äôst of the mortal race,
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôry thought now in his gen‚Äôrous heart
‚Ä≠  To deeds that further my desires convert.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus took he in with both his hands his store,
‚Ä≠  And in the uncouth scrip, that lay before
‚Ä≠  His ill-shod feet, repos‚Äôd it; whence he fed
‚Ä≠  All time the music to the feasters play‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Both jointly ending, then began the Wooers
‚Ä≠  To put in old act their tumultuous pow‚Äôrs;
‚Ä≠  When Pallas standing close did prompt her friend,
‚Ä≠  To prove how far the bounties would extend
‚Ä≠  Of those proud Wooers; so, to let him try
‚Ä≠  Who most, who least, had learn‚Äôd humanity.
‚Ä≠  However, no thought touch‚Äôd Minerva‚Äôs mind,
‚Ä≠  That anyone should‚Äôscape his wreak design‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  He handsomely became all, crept about
‚Ä≠  To ev‚Äôry Wooer, held a forc‚Äôd hand out,
‚Ä≠  And all his work did in so like a way,
‚Ä≠  As he had practis‚Äôd begging many a day.
‚Ä≠  And though they knew all beggars could do this,
‚Ä≠  Yet they admir‚Äôd it as no deed of his;
‚Ä≠  Though far from thought of other, us‚Äôd expence
‚Ä≠  And pity to him, who he was, and whence,
‚Ä≠  Inquiring mutually.  Melanthius then:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúHear me, ye Wooers of the far-fam‚Äôd queen,
‚Ä≠  About this beggar.  I have seen before
‚Ä≠  This face of his; and know for certain more,
‚Ä≠  That this swain brought him hither.  What he is,
‚Ä≠  Or whence he came, flies me.‚Äù  Reply to this
‚Ä≠  Antinous made, and mock‚Äôd Eum√¶us thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO thou renown√©d herdsman, why to us
‚Ä≠  Brought‚Äôst thou this beggar?  Serves it not our hands;
‚Ä≠  That other land-leapers, and cormorands,
‚Ä≠  Profane poor knaves, lie on us, unconducted,
‚Ä≠  But you must bring them?  So amiss instructed
‚Ä≠  Art thou in course of thrift, as not to know
‚Ä≠  Thy lord‚Äôs goods wrack‚Äôd in this their overflow?
‚Ä≠  Which think‚Äôst thou nothing, that thou call‚Äôst in these?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Eum√¶us answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúThough you may be wise,
‚Ä≠  You speak not wisely.  Who calls in a guest
‚Ä≠  That is a guest himself?  None call to feast
‚Ä≠  Other than men that are of public use,
‚Ä≠  Prophets, or poets, whom the Gods produce,
‚Ä≠  Physicians for men‚Äôs ills, or architects.
‚Ä≠  Such men the boundless earth affords respects
‚Ä≠  Bounded in honour, and may call them well.
‚Ä≠  But poor men who calls?  Who doth so excell
‚Ä≠  In others‚Äô good to do himself an ill?
‚Ä≠  But all Ulysses‚Äô servants have been still
‚Ä≠  Eyesores in your way more than all that woo,
‚Ä≠  And chiefly I.  But what care I for you,
‚Ä≠  As long as these roofs hold as thralls to none
‚Ä≠  The wise Penelope and her god-like son?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúForbear,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúand leave this tongue‚Äôs bold ill.
‚Ä≠  Antinous uses to be crossing still,
‚Ä≠  And give sharp words; his blood that humour bears,
‚Ä≠  To set men still together by the ears.
‚Ä≠  But,‚Äù  turning then t‚Äô Antinous,  ‚ÄúO,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúYou entertain a father‚Äôs care of me,
‚Ä≠  To turn these eating guests out.  ‚ÄôTis advice
‚Ä≠  Of needful use for my poor faculties,
‚Ä≠  But God doth not allow this; there must be
‚Ä≠  Some care of poor men in humanity.
‚Ä≠  What you yourselves take, give; I not envy,
‚Ä≠  But give command that hospitality
‚Ä≠  Be giv‚Äôn all strangers.  Nor shall my pow‚Äôrs fear,
‚Ä≠  If this mood in me reach my mother‚Äôs ear;
‚Ä≠  Much less the servants‚Äô, that are here to see
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô house kept in his old degree.
‚Ä≠  But you bear no such mind, your wits more cast
‚Ä≠  To fill yourself than let another taste.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Antinous answer‚Äôd him:  ‚ÄúBrave-spoken man!
‚Ä≠  Whose mind‚Äôs free fire see check‚Äôd no virtue can.
‚Ä≠  If all we Wooers here would give as much
‚Ä≠  As my mind serves, his  [4]  largess should be such
‚Ä≠  As would for three months serve his far-off way
‚Ä≠  From troubling your house with more cause of stay.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he took a stool up, that did rest,
‚Ä≠  Beneath the board, his spangled feet at feast,
‚Ä≠  And offer‚Äôd at him; but the rest gave all,
‚Ä≠  And fill‚Äôd his fulsome scrip with festival.
‚Ä≠  And so Ulysses for the present was,
‚Ä≠  And for the future, furnish‚Äôd, and his pass
‚Ä≠  Bent to the door to eat.  Yet could not leave
‚Ä≠  Antinous so, but said:  ‚ÄúDo you too give,
‚Ä≠  Lov‚Äôd lord; your presence makes a show to me
‚Ä≠  As you not worst were of the company,
‚Ä≠  But best, and so much that you seem the king,
‚Ä≠  And therefore you should give some better thing
‚Ä≠  Than bread, like others.  I will spread your praise
‚Ä≠  Through all the wide world, that have in my days
‚Ä≠  Kept house myself, and trod the wealthy ways
‚Ä≠  Of other men ev‚Äôn to the title Blest;
‚Ä≠  And often have I giv‚Äôn an erring guest
‚Ä≠  (How mean soever) to the utmost gain
‚Ä≠  Of what he wanted, kept whole troops of men,
‚Ä≠  And had all other comings in, with which
‚Ä≠  Men live so well, and gain the fame of rich.
‚Ä≠  Yet Jove consum‚Äôd all; he would have it so;
‚Ä≠  To which, his mean was this:  He made me go
‚Ä≠  Far off, for Egypt, in the rude consort
‚Ä≠  Of all-ways-wand‚Äôring pirates, where, in port,
‚Ä≠  I bade my lov‚Äôd men draw their ships ashore,
‚Ä≠  And dwell amongst them; sent out some t‚Äô explore
‚Ä≠  Up to the mountains, who, intemperate,
‚Ä≠  And their inflam‚Äôd bloods bent to satiate,
‚Ä≠  Forag‚Äôd the rich fields, hal‚Äôd the women thence,
‚Ä≠  And unwean‚Äôd children, with the foul expence
‚Ä≠  Both of their fames and bloods.  The cry then flew
‚Ä≠  Straight to the city; and the great fields grew
‚Ä≠  With horse and foot, and flam‚Äôd with iron arms;
‚Ä≠  When Jove (that breaks the thunder in alarms)
‚Ä≠  An ill flight cast amongst my men; not one
‚Ä≠  Inspir‚Äôd with spirit to stand, and turn upon
‚Ä≠  The fierce pursuing foe; and therefore stood
‚Ä≠  Their ill fate thick about them; some in blood,
‚Ä≠  And some in bondage; toils led by constraint
‚Ä≠  Fast‚Äôning upon them.  Me along they sent
‚Ä≠  To Cyprus with a stranger-prince they met,
‚Ä≠  Dmetor Iasides, who th‚Äô imperial seat
‚Ä≠  Of that sweet island sway‚Äôd in strong command.
‚Ä≠  And thus feel I here need‚Äôs contemned hand.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAnd what God sent,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúthis suff‚Äôring bane
‚Ä≠  To vex our banquet?  Stand off, nor profane
‚Ä≠  My board so boldly, lest I show thee here
‚Ä≠  Cyprus and Egypt made more sour than there.
‚Ä≠  You are a saucy set-fac‚Äôd vagabond.
‚Ä≠  About with all you go, and they, beyond
‚Ä≠  Discretion, give thee, since they find not here
‚Ä≠  The least proportion set down to their cheer.
‚Ä≠  But ev‚Äôry fountain hath his under-floods.
‚Ä≠  _It is no bounty to give others‚Äô goods.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO Gods,‚Äù  replied Ulysses,  ‚ÄúI see now,
‚Ä≠  You bear no soul in this your goodly show.
‚Ä≠  Beggars at your board, I perceive, should get
‚Ä≠  Scarce salt from your hands, if themselves brought meat;
‚Ä≠  Since, sitting where another‚Äôs board is spread,
‚Ä≠  That flows with feast, not to the broken bread
‚Ä≠  Will your allowance reach.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNay then,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  And look‚Äôd austerely,  ‚Äúif so saucy be
‚Ä≠  Your suffer‚Äôd language, I suppose, that clear
‚Ä≠  You shall not ‚Äôscape without some broken cheer.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus rapt he up a stool, with which he smit
‚Ä≠  The king‚Äôs right shoulder, ‚Äôtwixt his neck and it.
‚Ä≠  He stood him like a rock.  Antinous‚Äô dart
‚Ä≠  Nor stirr‚Äôd Ulysses; who in his great heart
‚Ä≠  Deep ills projected, which, for time yet, close
‚Ä≠  He bound in silence, shook his head, and went
‚Ä≠  Out to the entry, where he then gave vent
‚Ä≠  To his full scrip, sat on the earth, and eat,
‚Ä≠  And talk‚Äôd still to the Wooers:  ‚ÄúHear me yet,
‚Ä≠  Ye Wooers of the Queen.  It never grieves
‚Ä≠  A man to take blows, where for sheep, or beeves,
‚Ä≠  Or other main possessions, a man fights;
‚Ä≠  But for his harmful belly this man smites,
‚Ä≠  Whose love to many a man breeds many a woe.
‚Ä≠  And if the poor have Gods, and Furies too,
‚Ä≠  Before Antinous wear his nuptial wreath,
‚Ä≠  He shall be worn upon the dart of death.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHarsh guest,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúsit silent at your meat,
‚Ä≠  Or seek your desp‚Äôrate plight some safer seat,
‚Ä≠  Lest by the hands or heels youths drag your years,
‚Ä≠  And rend your rotten rags about your ears.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This made the rest as highly hate his folly,
‚Ä≠  As he had violated something holy.
‚Ä≠  When one, ev‚Äôn of the proudest, thus began:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúThou dost not nobly, thus to play the man
‚Ä≠  On such an errant wretch.  O ill dispos‚Äôd!
‚Ä≠  Perhaps some sacred Godhead goes enclos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn in his abject outside; for the Gods
‚Ä≠  Have often visited these rich abodes
‚Ä≠  Like such poor stranger pilgrims, since their pow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  (Being always shapeful) glide through towns and tow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  Observing, as they pass still, who they be
‚Ä≠  That piety love, and who impiety.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This all men said, but he held sayings cheap.
‚Ä≠  And all this time Telemachus did heap
‚Ä≠  Sorrow on sorrow on his beating heart,
‚Ä≠  To see his father stricken; yet let part
‚Ä≠  No tear to earth, but shook his head, and thought
‚Ä≠  As deep as those ills that were after wrought.
‚Ä≠     The Queen now, hearing of her poor guest‚Äôs stroke,
‚Ä≠  Said to her maid (as to her Wooer she spoke),
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúI wish the famous-for-his-bow, the Sun,
‚Ä≠  Would strike thy heart so.‚Äù  Her wish, thus begun,
‚Ä≠  Her lady, fair Eurynome, pursued
‚Ä≠  Her execration, and did thus conclude:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúSo may our vows call down from heav‚Äôn his end,
‚Ä≠  And let no one life of the rest extend
‚Ä≠  His life till morning.‚Äù   ‚ÄúO Eurynom√©,‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Replied the Queen,  ‚Äúmay all Gods speak in thee,
‚Ä≠  For all the Wooers we should rate as foes,
‚Ä≠  Since all their weals they place in others‚Äô woes!
‚Ä≠  But this Antinous we past all should hate,
‚Ä≠  As one resembling black and cruel Fate.
‚Ä≠  A poor strange wretch begg‚Äôd here, compell‚Äôd by need,
‚Ä≠  Ask‚Äôd all, and ev‚Äôry one gave in his deed,
‚Ä≠  Fill‚Äôd his sad scrip, and eas‚Äôd his heavy wants,
‚Ä≠  Only this man bestow‚Äôd unmanly taunts,
‚Ä≠  And with a cruel blow, his force let fly,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòTwixt neck and shoulders show‚Äôd his charity.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  These minds, above, she and her maids did show,
‚Ä≠  While, at his scrip, Ulysses sat below.
‚Ä≠  In which time she Eum√¶us call‚Äôd, and said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúGo, good Eum√¶us, and see soon convey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The stranger to me; bid him come and take
‚Ä≠  My salutations for his welcome‚Äôs sake,
‚Ä≠  And my desire serve, if he hath not heard
‚Ä≠  Or seen distress‚Äôd Ulysses, who hath err‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Like such a man, and therefore chance may fall
‚Ä≠  He hath by him been met and spoke withal?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO Queen,‚Äù  said he,  ‚ÄúI wish to heav‚Äôn your ear
‚Ä≠  Were quit of this unrev‚Äôrend noise you hear
‚Ä≠  From these rude Wooers, when I bring the guest;
‚Ä≠  Such words your ear would let into your breast
‚Ä≠  As would delight it to your very heart.
‚Ä≠  Three nights and days I did my roof impart
‚Ä≠  To his fruition (for he came to me
‚Ä≠  The first of all men since he fled the sea)
‚Ä≠  And yet he had not giv‚Äôn a perfect end
‚Ä≠  To his relation of what woes did spend
‚Ä≠  The spite of Fate on him, but as you see  [5]
‚Ä≠  A singer, breathing out of Deity
‚Ä≠  Love-kindling lines, when all men seated near
‚Ä≠  Are rapt with endless thirst to ever hear;
‚Ä≠  So sweeten‚Äôd he my bosom at my meat,
‚Ä≠  Affirming that Ulysses was in Crete,
‚Ä≠  Where first the memories of Minos were,
‚Ä≠  A guest to him there dwelling then, as dear
‚Ä≠  As his true father; and from thence came he
‚Ä≠  Tir‚Äôd on with sorrows, toss‚Äôd from sea to sea,
‚Ä≠  To cast himself in dust, and tumble here,
‚Ä≠  At Wooers‚Äô feet, for blows and broken cheer.
‚Ä≠  But of Ulysses, where the Thesprots dwell,
‚Ä≠  A wealthy people, Fame, he says, did tell
‚Ä≠  The still survival; who his native light
‚Ä≠  Was bound for now, with treasure infinite.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúCall him,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúthat he himself may say
‚Ä≠  This over to me.  We shall soon have way
‚Ä≠  Giv‚Äôn by the Wooers; they, as well at gate,
‚Ä≠  As set within doors, use to recreate
‚Ä≠  Their high-fed spirits.  As their humours lead
‚Ä≠  They follow; and may well; for still they tread
‚Ä≠  Uncharg‚Äôd ways here, their own wealth lying unwasted
‚Ä≠  In poor-kept houses, only something tasted
‚Ä≠  Their bread and wine is by their household swains,
‚Ä≠  But they themselves let loose continual reins
‚Ä≠  To our expenses, making slaughter still
‚Ä≠  Of sheep, goats, oxen, feeding past their fill,
‚Ä≠  And vainly lavishing our richest wine;
‚Ä≠  All these extending past the sacred line,
‚Ä≠  For here lives no man like Ulysses now
‚Ä≠  To curb these reins.  But should he once show
‚Ä≠  His country-light his presence, he and his
‚Ä≠  Would soon revenge these Wooers‚Äô injuries.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, about the house, in echoes round,
‚Ä≠  Her son‚Äôs strange neesings made a horrid sound;  [6]
‚Ä≠  At which the Queen yet laugh‚Äôd, and said:  ‚ÄúGo call
‚Ä≠  The stranger to me.  Heard‚Äôst thou not, to all
‚Ä≠  My words last utter‚Äôd, what a neesing brake
‚Ä≠  From my Telemachus?  From whence I make,
‚Ä≠  This sure conclusion:  That the death and fate
‚Ä≠  Of ev‚Äôry Wooer here is near his date.
‚Ä≠  Call, then, the guest, and if he tell as true
‚Ä≠  What I shall ask him, coat, cloak, all things new,
‚Ä≠  These hands shall yield him.‚Äù  This said, down he went,
‚Ä≠  And told Ulysses,  ‚Äúthat the Queen had sent
‚Ä≠  To call him to her, that she might enquire
‚Ä≠  About her husband what her sad desire
‚Ä≠  Urg‚Äôd her to ask; and, if she found him true,
‚Ä≠  Both coat, and cassock (which he needed) new
‚Ä≠  Her hands would put on him; and that the bread,
‚Ä≠  Which now he begg‚Äôd amongst the common tread,
‚Ä≠  Should freely feed his hunger now from her,
‚Ä≠  Who all he wish‚Äôd would to his wants prefer.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     His answer was:  ‚ÄúI will with fit speed tell
‚Ä≠  The whole truth to the Queen; for passing well
‚Ä≠  I know her lord, since he and I have shar‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In equal sorrows.  But I much am scar‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With this rude multitude of Wooers here,
‚Ä≠  The rage of whose pride smites heav‚Äôn‚Äôs brazen sphere.
‚Ä≠  Of whose rout when one struck me for no fault,
‚Ä≠  Telemachus nor none else turn‚Äôd th‚Äô assault
‚Ä≠  From my poor shoulders.  Therefore, though she haste,
‚Ä≠  Beseech the Queen her patience will see past
‚Ä≠  The day‚Äôs broad light, and then may she enquire.
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTis but my closer pressing to the fire
‚Ä≠  In th‚Äô ev‚Äôning‚Äôs cold, because my weeds, you know,
‚Ä≠  Are passing thin; for I made bold to show
‚Ä≠  Their bracks to you, and pray‚Äôd your kind supply.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He heard, and hasted; and met instantly
‚Ä≠  The Queen upon the pavement in his way,
‚Ä≠  Who ask‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúWhat!  Bring‚Äôst thou not?  What cause of stay
‚Ä≠  Find his austere supposes?  Takes he fear
‚Ä≠  Of th‚Äô unjust Wooers?  Or thus hard doth bear
‚Ä≠  On any other doubt the house objects?
‚Ä≠  He does me wrong, and gives too nice respects
‚Ä≠  To his fear‚Äôd safety.‚Äù   ‚ÄúHe does right,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúAnd what he fears should move the policy
‚Ä≠  Of any wise one; taking care to shun
‚Ä≠  The violent Wooers.  He bids bide, till sun
‚Ä≠  Hath hid his broad light.  And, believe it, Queen,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTwill make your best course, since you two, unseen,
‚Ä≠  May pass th‚Äô encounter; you to speak more free,
‚Ä≠  And he your ear gain less distractedly.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúThe guest is wise,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúand well doth give
‚Ä≠  The right thought use.  Of all the men that live,
‚Ä≠  Life serves none such as these proud Wooers are,
‚Ä≠  To give a good man cause to use his care.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus, all agreed, amongst the Wooers goes
‚Ä≠  Eum√¶us to the prince, and, whisp‚Äôring close,
‚Ä≠  Said:  ‚ÄúNow, my love, my charge shall take up me,
‚Ä≠  (Your goods and mine).  What here is, you must see
‚Ä≠  In fit protection.  But, in chief, regard
‚Ä≠  Your own dear safeguard; whose state study hard,
‚Ä≠  Lest suff‚Äôrance seize you.  Many a wicked thought
‚Ä≠  Conceal these Wooers; whom just Jove see brought
‚Ä≠  To utter ruin, ere it touch at us.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúSo chance it, friend,‚Äù  replied Telemachus,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúYour bever taken, go.  In first of day
‚Ä≠  Come, and bring sacrifice the best you may.
‚Ä≠  To me and to th‚Äô Immortals be the care
‚Ä≠  or whatsoever here the safeties are.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he sat in his elaborate throne.
‚Ä≠  Eum√¶us (fed to satisfaction)
‚Ä≠  Went to his charge, left both the court and walls
‚Ä≠  Full of secure and fatal festivals,
‚Ä≠  In which the Wooers‚Äô pleasures still would sway.
‚Ä≠  And now begun the even‚Äôs near-ending day.

‚Ä≠  THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS.

‚Ä≠  THE EIGHTEENTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS
‚Ä≠
‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT
‚Ä≠
‚Ä≠  Ulysses and rogue Irus fight.
‚Ä≠  Penelope vouchsafes her sight
‚Ä≠  To all her Wooers; who present
‚Ä≠  Gifts to her, ravish‚Äôd with content.
‚Ä≠  A certain parl√© then we sing.
‚Ä≠  Betwixt a Wooer and the King.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _Œ£·Ω∑Œ≥ŒºŒ±._
‚Ä≠     The beggar‚Äôs glee.
‚Ä≠        The King‚Äôs high fame.
‚Ä≠     Gifts giv‚Äôn to see
‚Ä≠        A virtuous dame.

‚Ä≠  There came a common beggar to the court,
‚Ä≠  Who in the city begg‚Äôd of all resort,
‚Ä≠  Excell‚Äôd in madness of the gut, drunk, ate,
‚Ä≠  Past intermission, was most hugely great,
‚Ä≠  Yet had no fibres in him nor no force,
‚Ä≠  In sight a man, in mind a living corse.
‚Ä≠  His true name was Arn√¶us, for his mother
‚Ä≠  Impos‚Äôd it from his birth, and yet another
‚Ä≠  The city youth would give him (from the course
‚Ä≠  He after took, deriv‚Äôd out of the force
‚Ä≠  That need held on him, which was up and down
‚Ä≠  To run on all men‚Äôs errands through the town)
‚Ä≠  Which sounded Irus.  When whose gut was come,
‚Ä≠  He needs would bar Ulysses his own home,
‚Ä≠  And fell to chiding him:  ‚ÄúOld man,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúYour way out of the entry quickly see
‚Ä≠  Be with fair language taken, lest your stay
‚Ä≠  But little longer see you dragg‚Äôd away.
‚Ä≠  See, sir, observe you not how all these make
‚Ä≠  Direct signs at me, charging me to take
‚Ä≠  Your heels, and drag you out?  But I take shame.
‚Ä≠  Rise yet, y‚Äô are best, lest we two play a game
‚Ä≠  At cuffs together.‚Äù  He bent brows, and said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúWretch!  I do thee no ill, nor once upbraid
‚Ä≠  Thy presence with a word, nor, what mine eye
‚Ä≠  By all hands sees thee giv‚Äôn, one thought envy.
‚Ä≠  Nor shouldst thou envy others.  Thou may‚Äôst see
‚Ä≠  The place will hold us both; and seem‚Äôst to me
‚Ä≠  A beggar like myself; which who can mend?
‚Ä≠  _The Gods give most to whom they least are friend.
‚Ä≠  The chief goods Gods give, is in good to end._
‚Ä≠  But to the hands‚Äô strife, of which y‚Äô are so free,
‚Ä≠  Provoke me not, for fear you anger me;
‚Ä≠  And lest the old man, on whose scorn you stood,
‚Ä≠  Your lips and bosom make shake hands in blood.
‚Ä≠  I love my quiet well, and more will love
‚Ä≠  To-morrow than to-day.  But if you move
‚Ä≠  My peace beyond my right, the war you make
‚Ä≠  Will never after give you will to take
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô house into your begging walk.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO Gods,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúhow volubly doth talk
‚Ä≠  This eating gulf!  And how his fume breaks out,
‚Ä≠  As from an old crack‚Äôd oven!  Whom I will clout
‚Ä≠  So bitterly, and so with both hands mall
‚Ä≠  His chaps together, that his teeth shall fall
‚Ä≠  As plain seen on the earth as any sow‚Äôs,
‚Ä≠  That ruts the corn-fields, or devours the mows.
‚Ä≠  Come, close we now, that all may see what wrong
‚Ä≠  An old man tempts that takes at cuffs a young.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus in the entry of those lofty tow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  These two, with all spleen, spent their jarring pow‚Äôrs.
‚Ä≠  Antinous took it, laugh‚Äôd, and said:  ‚ÄúO friends,
‚Ä≠  We never had such sport!  This guest contends
‚Ä≠  With this vast beggar at the buffet‚Äôs fight.
‚Ä≠  Come, join we hands, and screw up all their spite.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     All rose in laughters; and about them bore
‚Ä≠  All the ragg‚Äôd rout of beggars at the door.
‚Ä≠  Then mov‚Äôd Antinous the victor‚Äôs hire
‚Ä≠  To all the Wooers thus:  ‚ÄúThere are now at fire
‚Ä≠  Two breasts of goat; both which let law set down
‚Ä≠  Before the man that wins the day‚Äôs renown,
‚Ä≠  With all their fat and gravy.  And of both
‚Ä≠  The glorious victor shall prefer his tooth,
‚Ä≠  To which he makes his choice of, from us all,
‚Ä≠  And ever after banquet in our hall,
‚Ä≠  With what our boards yield; not a beggar more
‚Ä≠  Allow‚Äôd to share, but all keep out at door.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This he propos‚Äôd; and this they all approv‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  To which Ulysses answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúO most lov‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  By no means should an old man, and one old
‚Ä≠  In chief with sorrows, be so over-bold
‚Ä≠  To combat with his younger; but, alas,
‚Ä≠  Man‚Äôs own-ill-working belly needs will pass
‚Ä≠  This work upon me, and enforce me, too,
‚Ä≠  To beat this fellow.  But then, you must do
‚Ä≠  My age no wrong, to take my younger‚Äôs part,
‚Ä≠  And play me foul play, making your strokes‚Äô smart
‚Ä≠  Help his to conquer; for you eas‚Äôly may
‚Ä≠  With your strengths crush me.  Do then right, and lay
‚Ä≠  Your honours on it in your oaths, to yield
‚Ä≠  His part no aid, but equal leave the field.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     All swore his will.  But then Telemachus
‚Ä≠  His father‚Äôs scoffs with comforts serious
‚Ä≠  Could not but answer, and made this reply:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúGuest!  If thine own pow‚Äôrs cheer thy victory,
‚Ä≠  Fear no man‚Äôs else that will not pass it free.
‚Ä≠  He fights with many that shall touch but thee.
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll see thy guest-right paid.  Thou here art come
‚Ä≠  In my protection; and to this the sum
‚Ä≠  Of all these Wooers (which Antinous are
‚Ä≠  And King Eurymachus) conjoin their care.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Both vow‚Äôd it.  When Ulysses, laying by
‚Ä≠  His upper weed, his inner beggary
‚Ä≠  Near show‚Äôd his shame, which he with rags prevented
‚Ä≠  Pluck‚Äôd from about his thighs, and so presented
‚Ä≠  Their goodly sight, which were so white and great,
‚Ä≠  And his large shoulders were to view so set
‚Ä≠  By his bare rags, his arms, his breast, and all,
‚Ä≠  So broad, and brawny--their grace natural
‚Ä≠  Being kept by Pallas, ever standing near--
‚Ä≠  That all the Wooers his admirers were
‚Ä≠  Beyond all measure, mutual whispers driv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  Through all their cluster, saying:  ‚ÄúSure as heav‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  Poor Irus pull‚Äôd upon him bitter blows.
‚Ä≠  Through his thin garment what a thigh he shows!‚Äù
‚Ä≠     They said; but Irus felt.  His coward mind
‚Ä≠  Was mov‚Äôd at root.  But now he needs must find
‚Ä≠  Facts to his brags; and forth at all parts fit
‚Ä≠  The servants brought him, all his art‚Äôries smit
‚Ä≠  With fears and tremblings.  Which Antinous saw,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúNay, now too late comes fear.  No law
‚Ä≠  Thou shouldst at first have giv‚Äôn thy braggart vein,
‚Ä≠  Nor should it so have swell‚Äôd, if terrors strain
‚Ä≠  Thy spirits to this pass, for a man so old,
‚Ä≠  And worn with penuries that still lay hold
‚Ä≠  On his ragg‚Äôd person.  Howsoever, take
‚Ä≠  This vow from me for firm:  That if, he make
‚Ä≠  Thy forces stoop, and prove his own supreme,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll put thee in a ship, and down the stream
‚Ä≠  Send thee ashore where King Echetus reigns,
‚Ä≠  (The roughest tyrant that the world contains)
‚Ä≠  And he will slit thy nostrils, crop each ear,
‚Ä≠  Thy shame cut off, and give it dogs to tear.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This shook his nerves the more.  But both were now
‚Ä≠  Brought to the lists; and up did either throw
‚Ä≠  His heavy fists.  Ulysses, in suspense
‚Ä≠  To strike so home that he should fright from thence
‚Ä≠  His coward soul, his trunk laid prostrate there,
‚Ä≠  Or let him take more leisure to his fear,
‚Ä≠  And stoop him by degrees.  The last show‚Äôd best,
‚Ä≠  To strike him slightly, out of fear the rest
‚Ä≠  Would else discover him.  But, peace now broke,
‚Ä≠  On his right shoulder Irus laid his stroke.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses struck him just beneath the ear,
‚Ä≠  His jawbone broke, and made the blood appear;
‚Ä≠  When straight he strew‚Äôd the dust, and made his cry
‚Ä≠  Stand for himself; with whom his teeth did lie,
‚Ä≠  Spit with his blood out; and against the ground
‚Ä≠  His heels lay sprawling.  Up the hands went round
‚Ä≠  Of all the Wooers, all at point to die
‚Ä≠  With violent laughters.  Then the king did ply
‚Ä≠  The beggar‚Äôs feet, and dragg‚Äôd him forth the hall,
‚Ä≠  Along the entry, to the gates and wall;
‚Ä≠  Where leaving him, he put into his hand
‚Ä≠  A staff; and bade him there use his command
‚Ä≠  On swine and dogs, and not presume to be
‚Ä≠  Lord of the guests, or of the beggary,
‚Ä≠  Since he of all men was the scum and curse;
‚Ä≠  And so bade please with that, or fare yet worse.
‚Ä≠  Then cast he on his scrip, all-patch‚Äôd and rent,
‚Ä≠  Hung by a rotten cord, and back he went
‚Ä≠  To greet the entry‚Äôs threshold with his seat.
‚Ä≠     The Wooers throng‚Äôd to him, and did entreat
‚Ä≠  With gentle words his conquest, laughing still,
‚Ä≠  Pray‚Äôd Jove and all the Gods to give his will
‚Ä≠  What most it wish‚Äôd him and would joy him most,
‚Ä≠  Since he so happily had clear‚Äôd their coast
‚Ä≠  Of that unsavoury morsel; whom they vow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To see with all their utmost haste bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Aboard a ship, and for Epirus sent
‚Ä≠  To King Echetus, on whose throne was spent
‚Ä≠  The worst man‚Äôs seat that breath‚Äôd.  And thus was grac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Divine Ulysses, who with joy embrac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn that poor conquest.  Then was set to him
‚Ä≠  The goodly goat‚Äôs breast promis‚Äôd (that did swim
‚Ä≠  In fat and gravy) by Antinous,
‚Ä≠  And from a basket, by Amphinomus,
‚Ä≠  Were two breads giv‚Äôn him; who, besides, renown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His banquet with a golden goblet; crown‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And this high salutation:  ‚ÄúFrolic, guest,
‚Ä≠  And be those riches that you first possest
‚Ä≠  Restor‚Äôd again with full as many joys,
‚Ä≠  As in your poor state I see now annoys.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAmphinomus,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúyou seem to me
‚Ä≠  Exceeding wise, as being the progeny
‚Ä≠  Of such a father as authentic Fame
‚Ä≠  Hath told me was so, one of honour‚Äôd name,
‚Ä≠  And great revenues in Dulichius,
‚Ä≠  His fair name Nisus.  He is blazon‚Äôd thus;
‚Ä≠  And you to be his son, his wisdom heiring,
‚Ä≠  As well as wealth, his state in nought impairing.
‚Ä≠  To prove which always, let me tell you this,
‚Ä≠  (As warning you to shun the miseries
‚Ä≠  That follow full states, if they be not held
‚Ä≠  With wisdom still at full, and so compell‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To courses that abode not in their brows,
‚Ä≠  By too much swing, their sudden overthrows)
‚Ä≠  _Of all things breathing, or that creep on earth,
‚Ä≠  Nought is more wretched than a human birth.
‚Ä≠  Bless‚Äôd men think never they can cursed be,
‚Ä≠  While any power lasts to move a knee._
‚Ä≠  But when the bless‚Äôd Gods make them feel that smart,
‚Ä≠  That fled their faith so, as they had no heart
‚Ä≠  They bear their suff‚Äôrings, and, what well they might
‚Ä≠  Have clearly shunn‚Äôd, they then meet in despite.
‚Ä≠  _The mind of man flies still out of his way,
‚Ä≠  Unless God guide and prompt it ev‚Äôry day._
‚Ä≠  I thought me once a bless√©d man with men.
‚Ä≠  And fashion‚Äôd me to all so counted then,
‚Ä≠  Did all injustice like them, what for lust,
‚Ä≠  Or any pleasure, never so unjust
‚Ä≠  I could by pow‚Äôr or violence obtain,
‚Ä≠  And gave them both in all their pow‚Äôrs the rein,
‚Ä≠  Bold of my fathers and my brothers still;
‚Ä≠  While which held good my arts seem‚Äôd never ill.
‚Ä≠  And thus is none held simply good or bad,
‚Ä≠  But as his will is either miss‚Äôd or had.
‚Ä≠  All goods God‚Äôs gifts man calls, howe‚Äôer he gets them,
‚Ä≠  And so takes all; what price soe‚Äôer God sets them,
‚Ä≠  Says nought how ill they come, nor will controul
‚Ä≠  That ravine in him, though it cost his soul.
‚Ä≠  And these parts here I see these Wooers play,
‚Ä≠  Take all that falls, and all dishonours lay
‚Ä≠  On that man‚Äôs Queen, that, tell your friends, doth bear
‚Ä≠  No long time‚Äôs absence, but is passing near.
‚Ä≠  Let God then guide thee home, lest he may meet
‚Ä≠  In his return thy undeparted feet;
‚Ä≠  For when he enters, and sees men so rude,
‚Ä≠  The quarrel cannot but in blood conclude.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he sacrific‚Äôd, then drunk, and then
‚Ä≠  Referr‚Äôd the giv‚Äôn bowl to the guide-of-men;
‚Ä≠  Who walk‚Äôd away, afflicted at his heart,
‚Ä≠  Shook head, and fear‚Äôd that these facts would convert
‚Ä≠  To ill in th‚Äô end; yet had not grace to fly,
‚Ä≠  Minerva stay‚Äôd him, being ordain‚Äôd to die
‚Ä≠  Upon the lance of young Ulyssides.
‚Ä≠     So down he sat; and then did Pallas please
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô incline the Queen‚Äôs affections to appear
‚Ä≠  To all the Wooers, to extend their cheer
‚Ä≠  To th‚Äô utmost lightning that still ushers death,
‚Ä≠  And made her put on all the painted sheath,
‚Ä≠  That might both set her Wooers‚Äô fancies high,
‚Ä≠  And get her greater honour in the eye
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn of her son and sov‚Äôreign than before.
‚Ä≠  Who laughing yet, to show her humour bore
‚Ä≠  No serious appetite to that light show,
‚Ä≠  She told Eurynom√©, that not till now
‚Ä≠  She ever knew her entertain desire
‚Ä≠  To please her Wooers‚Äô eyes, but oft on fire
‚Ä≠  She set their hate, in keeping from them still;
‚Ä≠  Yet now she pleas‚Äôd t‚Äô appear, though from no will
‚Ä≠  To do them honour, vowing she would tell
‚Ä≠  Her son that of them that should fit him well
‚Ä≠  To make use of; which was, not to converse
‚Ä≠  Too freely with their pride, nor to disperse
‚Ä≠  His thoughts amongst them, since they us‚Äôd to give
‚Ä≠  Good words, but through them ill intents did drive.
‚Ä≠     Eurynom√© replied:  ‚ÄúWith good advise
‚Ä≠  You vow his counsel, and your open guise.
‚Ä≠  Go then, advise your son, nor keep more close
‚Ä≠  Your cheeks, still drown‚Äôd in your eyes‚Äô overflows,
‚Ä≠  But bathe your body, and with balms make clear
‚Ä≠  Your thicken‚Äôd count‚Äônance.  _Uncompos√©d cheer,
‚Ä≠  And ever mourning, will the marrow wear._
‚Ä≠  Nor have you cause to mourn; your son hath now
‚Ä≠  Put on that virtue which, in chief, your vow
‚Ä≠  Wish‚Äôd, as your blessing, at his birth, might deck
‚Ä≠  His blood and person.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut forbear to speak
‚Ä≠  Of baths, or balmings, or of beauty, now,‚Äù
‚Ä≠  The Queen replied,  ‚Äúlest, urging comforts, you
‚Ä≠  Discomfort much; because the Gods have won
‚Ä≠  The spoil of my looks since my lord was gone.
‚Ä≠  But these must serve.  Call hither then to me
‚Ä≠  Hippodamia and Autono√©,
‚Ä≠  That those our train additions may supply
‚Ä≠  Our own deserts.  And yet, besides, not I,
‚Ä≠  With all my age, have learn‚Äôd the boldness yet
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô expose myself to men, unless I get
‚Ä≠  Some other gracers.‚Äù  This said, forth she went
‚Ä≠  To call the ladies, and much spirit spent
‚Ä≠  To make their utmost speed, for now their Queen
‚Ä≠  Would both herself show, and make them be seen.
‚Ä≠     But now Minerva other projects laid,
‚Ä≠  And through Icarius‚Äô daughter‚Äôs veins convey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Sweet sleep‚Äôs desire; in whose soft fumes involv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  She was as soon as laid, and quite dissolv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Were all her lineaments.  The Goddess then
‚Ä≠  Bestow‚Äôd immortal gifts on her, that men
‚Ä≠  Might wonder at her beauties; and the beams
‚Ä≠  That glister in the Deified Supremes
‚Ä≠  She clear‚Äôd her mourning count‚Äônance up withall.
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn such a radiance as doth round empall
‚Ä≠  Crown‚Äôd Cytherea, when her order‚Äôd places
‚Ä≠  Conduct the bevy of the dancing Graces,
‚Ä≠  She added to her own; more plump, more high,
‚Ä≠  And fairer than the polish‚Äôd ivory,
‚Ä≠  Rend‚Äôring her parts and presence.  This grace done,
‚Ä≠  Away the Deity flew; and up did run
‚Ä≠  Her lovely-wristed ladies, with a noise
‚Ä≠  That blew the soft chains from her sleeping joys;
‚Ä≠  When she her fair eyes wip‚Äôd, and, gasping, said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO me unblest!  How deep a sweet sleep spread
‚Ä≠  His shades about me!  Would Diana pleas‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To shoot me with a death no more diseas‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  As soon as might be, that no more my moan
‚Ä≠  Might waste my blood in weepings never done,
‚Ä≠  For want of that accomplish‚Äôd virtue spher‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In my lov‚Äôd lord, to all the Greeks preferr‚Äôd!‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Then she descended with her maids, and took
‚Ä≠  Place in the portal; whence her beamy look
‚Ä≠  Reach‚Äôd ev‚Äôry Wooer‚Äôs heart; yet cast she on
‚Ä≠  So thin a veil, that through it quite there shone
‚Ä≠  A grace so stol‚Äôn, it pleas‚Äôd above the clear,
‚Ä≠  And sunk the knees of ev‚Äôry Wooer there,
‚Ä≠  Their minds so melted in love‚Äôs vehement fires,
‚Ä≠  That to her bed she heighten‚Äôd all desires.
‚Ä≠     The prince then coming near, she said:  ‚ÄúO son,
‚Ä≠  Thy thoughts and judgments have not yet put on
‚Ä≠  That constancy in what becomes their good,
‚Ä≠  Which all expect in thee.  Thy younger blood
‚Ä≠  Did sparkle choicer spirits; but, arriv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  At this full growth, wherein their form hath thriv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Beyond the bounds of childhood, and when now,
‚Ä≠  Beholders should affirm,  ‚ÄòThis man doth grow
‚Ä≠  Like the rare son of his matchless Sire,
‚Ä≠  (His goodliness, his beauty, and his fire
‚Ä≠  Of soul aspir‚Äôd to)‚Äô  thou mak‚Äôst nothing good
‚Ä≠  Thy fate, nor fortune, nor thy height of blood,
‚Ä≠  In manage of thy actions.  What a deed
‚Ä≠  Of foul desert hath thy gross suff‚Äôrance freed
‚Ä≠  Beneath thine own roof!  A poor stranger here
‚Ä≠  Us‚Äôd most unmanly!  How will this appear
‚Ä≠  To all the world, when Fame shall trumpet out,
‚Ä≠  That thus, and thus, are our guests beat about
‚Ä≠  Our court unrighted?  ‚ÄôTis a blaze will show
‚Ä≠  Extremely shameful to your name and you.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI blame you not, O mother,‚Äù  he replied,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThat, this clear wrong sustain‚Äôd by me, you chide;
‚Ä≠  Yet know I both the good and bad of all,
‚Ä≠  Being past the years in which young errors fall.
‚Ä≠  But, all this known, skill is not so exact
‚Ä≠  To give, when once it knows, things fit their fact.
‚Ä≠  I well may doubt the prease of strangers here,
‚Ä≠  Who, bent to ill, and only my nerves near,
‚Ä≠  May do it in despite.  And yet the jar
‚Ä≠  Betwixt our guest and Irus was no war
‚Ä≠  Wrought by the Wooers; nor our guest sustain‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Wrong in that action, but the conquest gain‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  And would to Jove, Minerva, and the Sun,
‚Ä≠  That all your Wooers might serve Contention
‚Ä≠  For such a purchase as the beggar made,
‚Ä≠  And wore such weak heads!  Some should death invade,
‚Ä≠  Strew‚Äôd in the entry, some embrue the hall,
‚Ä≠  Till ev‚Äôry man had vengeance capital,
‚Ä≠  Sattled like Irus at the gates, his head
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôry way nodding, like one forfeited
‚Ä≠  To reeling Bacchus, knees nor feet his own,
‚Ä≠  To bear him where he‚Äôs better lov‚Äôd or known.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Their speeches giv‚Äôn this end, Eurymachus
‚Ä≠  Began his courtship, and express‚Äôd it thus:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúMost wise Icarius‚Äô daughter!  If all those,
‚Ä≠  That did for Colchos vent‚Äôrous sail dispose
‚Ä≠  For that rich purchase, had before but seen
‚Ä≠  Earth‚Äôs richer prize in th‚Äô Ithacensian Queen,
‚Ä≠  They had not made that voyage, but to you
‚Ä≠  Would all their virtues and their beings vow.
‚Ä≠  Should all the world know what a worth you store,
‚Ä≠  To-morrow than to-day, and next light, more
‚Ä≠  Your court should banquet; since to all dames you
‚Ä≠  Are far preferr‚Äôd, both for the grace of show,
‚Ä≠  In stature, beauty, form in ev‚Äôry kind
‚Ä≠  Of all parts outward, and for faultless mind.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAlas,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúmy virtue, body, form,
‚Ä≠  The Gods have blasted with that only storm
‚Ä≠  That ravish‚Äôd Greece to Ilion, since my lord,
‚Ä≠  For that war shipp‚Äôd, bore all my goods aboard.
‚Ä≠  If he, return‚Äôd, should come and govern here
‚Ä≠  My life‚Äôs whole state, the grace of all things there
‚Ä≠  His guide would heighten, as the spirit it bore;
‚Ä≠  Which dead in me lives, giv‚Äôn him long before.
‚Ä≠  A sad course I live now; Heav‚Äôn‚Äôs stern decree
‚Ä≠  With many an ill hath numb‚Äôd and deaded me.
‚Ä≠  He took life with him, when he took my hand
‚Ä≠  In parting from me to the Trojan strand,
‚Ä≠  These words my witness:  ‚ÄòWoman!  I conceive
‚Ä≠  That not all th‚Äô Achives bound for Troy shall leave
‚Ä≠  Their native earth their safe return√©d bones,
‚Ä≠  Fame saying, that Troy trains up approv√©d sons
‚Ä≠  In deeds of arms, brave putters-off of shafts,
‚Ä≠  For winging lances masters of their crafts,
‚Ä≠  Unmatch√©d riders, swift of foot, and straight
‚Ä≠  Can arbitrate a war of deadliest weight.
‚Ä≠  Hope then can scarce fill all with life‚Äôs supply,
‚Ä≠  And of all any failing, why not I?
‚Ä≠  Nor do I know, if God hath marshall‚Äôd me
‚Ä≠  Amongst the safe-return‚Äôd; or his decree
‚Ä≠  Hath left me to the thraldom order‚Äôd there.
‚Ä≠  However, all cares be thy burthens here,
‚Ä≠  My sire and mother tend as much as now,
‚Ä≠  I further off, more near in cares be you.
‚Ä≠  Your son to man‚Äôs state grown, wed whom you will;
‚Ä≠  And, you gone, his care let his household fill.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  Thus made my lord his will, which Heav‚Äôn sees prov‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Almost at all parts; for the Sun remov‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Down to his set, ere long, will lead the night
‚Ä≠  Of those abhorr√©d nuptials, that should fright
‚Ä≠  Each worthy woman, which her second are
‚Ä≠  With any man that breathes, her first lord‚Äôs care
‚Ä≠  Dead, because he to flesh and blood is dead;
‚Ä≠  Which, I fear, I shall yield to, and so wed
‚Ä≠  A second husband; and my reason is,
‚Ä≠  Since Jove hath taken from me all his bliss.
‚Ä≠  _Whom God gives over they themselves forsake,
‚Ä≠  Their griefs their joys, their God their devil, make._
‚Ä≠  And ‚Äôtis a great grief, nor was seen till now
‚Ä≠  In any fashion of such men as woo
‚Ä≠  A good and wealthy woman, and contend
‚Ä≠  Who shall obtain her, that those men should spend
‚Ä≠  Her beeves and best sheep, as their chiefest ends,
‚Ä≠  But rather that herself and all her friends
‚Ä≠  They should with banquets and rich gifts entreat.
‚Ä≠  _Their life is death that live with other‚Äôs meat.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     Divine Ulysses much rejoic‚Äôd to hear
‚Ä≠  His Queen thus fish for gifts, and keep in cheer.
‚Ä≠  Their hearts with hope that she would wed again,
‚Ä≠  Her mind yet still her first intent retain.
‚Ä≠     Antinous saw the Wooers won to give,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúWise Queen, by all your means receive
‚Ä≠  Whatever bounty any Wooer shall use.
‚Ä≠  Gifts freely giv‚Äôn ‚Äôtis folly to refuse.
‚Ä≠  For know, that we resolve not to be gone
‚Ä≠  To keep our own roofs, till of all some one,
‚Ä≠  Whom best you like, your long-woo‚Äôd love shall win.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This pleas‚Äôd the rest, and ev‚Äôry one sent in
‚Ä≠  His present by the herald.  First had place
‚Ä≠  Antinous‚Äô gift:  A robe of special grace,
‚Ä≠  Exceeding full and fair, and twenty hues
‚Ä≠  Chang‚Äôd lustre to it; to which choice of shows,
‚Ä≠  Twelve massy plated buttons, all of gold,
‚Ä≠  Enrich‚Äôd the substance, made to fairly hold
‚Ä≠  The robe together, all lac‚Äôd down before,
‚Ä≠  Where keeps and catches both sides of it wore.
‚Ä≠     Eurymachus a golden tablet gave,
‚Ä≠  In which did Art her choicest works engrave;
‚Ä≠  And round about an amber verge did run,
‚Ä≠  That cast a radiance from it like the Sun.
‚Ä≠     Eurydamas two servants had that bore
‚Ä≠  Two goodly earrings, whose rich hollows wore
‚Ä≠  Three pearls in either, like so many eyes,
‚Ä≠  Reflecting glances radiant as the skies.
‚Ä≠     The king Pisander, great Polyctor‚Äôs heir,
‚Ä≠  A casket gave, exceeding rich and fair.
‚Ä≠     The other other wealthy gifts commended
‚Ä≠  To her fair hand; which took, and straight ascended
‚Ä≠  This Goddess of her sex her upper state.
‚Ä≠  Her ladies all her gifts elaborate
‚Ä≠  Up bearing after.  All to dancing then
‚Ä≠  The Wooers went, and song‚Äôs delightful strain;
‚Ä≠  In which they frolick‚Äôd, till the evening came,
‚Ä≠  And then rais‚Äôd sable Hesperus his flame.
‚Ä≠  When, for their lights within, they set up there
‚Ä≠  Three lamps, whose wicks were wood exceeding sere,
‚Ä≠  And passing porous; which they caus‚Äôd to burn,
‚Ä≠  Their matter ever minister‚Äôd by turn
‚Ä≠  Of sev‚Äôral handmaids.  Whom Ulysses seeing
‚Ä≠  Too conversant with Wooers, ill-agreeing
‚Ä≠  With guise of maids, advis‚Äôd in this fair sort:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúMaids of your long-lack‚Äôd King, keep you the port
‚Ä≠  Your Queen‚Äôs chaste presence bears.  Go up to her,
‚Ä≠  Employ your looms, or rocks, and keep ye there;
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll serve to feed these lamps, should these lords‚Äô dances
‚Ä≠  Last till Aurora cheer‚Äôd us with their glances.
‚Ä≠  They cannot weary me, for I am one
‚Ä≠  Born to endure when all men else have done.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     They wantonly brake out in laughters all,
‚Ä≠  Look‚Äôd on each other; and to terms did fall
‚Ä≠  Cheek-proud Melantho, who was Dolius‚Äô seed,
‚Ä≠  Kept by the Queen, that gave her dainty bread
‚Ä≠  Fit for her daughter; and yet won not so
‚Ä≠  Her heart to her to share in any woe
‚Ä≠  She suffer‚Äôd for her lord, but she was great
‚Ä≠  With great Eurymachus, and her love‚Äôs heat
‚Ä≠  In his bed quench‚Äôd.  And this choleric thing
‚Ä≠  Bestow‚Äôd this railing language on the King:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúBase stranger, you are taken in your brain,
‚Ä≠  You talk so wildly.  Never you again
‚Ä≠  Can get where you were born, and seek your bed
‚Ä≠  In some smith‚Äôs hovel, or the marketsted,
‚Ä≠  But here you must take confidence to prate
‚Ä≠  Before all these; for fear can get no state
‚Ä≠  In your wine-hardy stomach.  Or ‚Äôtis like
‚Ä≠  To prove your native garb, your tongue will strike
‚Ä≠  On this side of your mouth still, being at best.
‚Ä≠  Is the man idle-brain‚Äôd for want of rest?
‚Ä≠  Or proud because he beat the roguish beggar?
‚Ä≠  Take heed, Sir, lest some better man beleager
‚Ä≠  Your ears with his fists, and set headlong hence
‚Ä≠  Your bold abode here with your blood‚Äôs expence.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He, looking sternly on her, answer‚Äôd her:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúDog!  What broad language giv‚Äôst thou?  I‚Äôll prefer
‚Ä≠  Your usage to the prince, that he may fall
‚Ä≠  Foul on your fair limbs till he tell them all.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This fray‚Äôd the wenches, and all straight got gone
‚Ä≠  In fear about their business, ev‚Äôry one
‚Ä≠  Confessing he said well.  But he stood now
‚Ä≠  Close by the cressets, and did looks bestow
‚Ä≠  On all men there; his brain employ‚Äôd about
‚Ä≠  Some sharper business than to dance it out,
‚Ä≠  Which had not long to go.  Nor therefore would
‚Ä≠  Minerva let the Wooers‚Äô spleens grow cold
‚Ä≠  With too good usuage of him, that his heart
‚Ä≠  Might fret enough, and make his choler smart.
‚Ä≠  Eurymachus provok‚Äôd him first, and made
‚Ä≠  His fellow laugh, with a conceit he had
‚Ä≠  Fetch‚Äôd far from what was spoken long before,
‚Ä≠  That his poor form perhaps some Deity bore.
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúIt well may chance,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúsome God doth bear
‚Ä≠  This man‚Äôs resemblance, for, thus standing near
‚Ä≠  The glist‚Äôring torches, his slick‚Äôd head doth throw
‚Ä≠  Beams round about it as those cressets do,
‚Ä≠  For not a hair he hath to give it shade.
‚Ä≠  Say, will thy heart serve t‚Äô undertake a trade
‚Ä≠  For fitting wages?  Should I take thee hence
‚Ä≠  To walk my grounds, and look to ev‚Äôry fence,
‚Ä≠  Or plant high trees, thy hire should raise thy forces
‚Ä≠  Food store, and clothes.  But these same idle courses
‚Ä≠  Thou art so prompt in that thou wilt not work,
‚Ä≠  But forage up and down, and beg, and lurk
‚Ä≠  In ev‚Äôry house whose roofs hold any will
‚Ä≠  To feed such fellows.  That thy gut may fill,
‚Ä≠  Gives end to all thy being.‚Äù  He replied:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI wish, at any work we two were tried,
‚Ä≠  In height of spring-time, when heav‚Äôn‚Äôs lights are long,
‚Ä≠  I a good crook‚Äôd scythe that were sharp and strong,
‚Ä≠  You such another, where the grass grew deep,
‚Ä≠  Up by day-break, and both our labours keep
‚Ä≠  Up till slow darkness eas‚Äôd the labouring light,
‚Ä≠  Fasting all day, and not a crumb till night;
‚Ä≠  We then should prove our either workmanship.
‚Ä≠  Or if, again, beeves, that the goad or whip
‚Ä≠  Were apt t‚Äô obey before a tearing plow,
‚Ä≠  Big lusty beasts, alike in bulk and brow,
‚Ä≠  Alike in labour, and alike in strength,
‚Ä≠  Our task four acres, to be till‚Äôd in length
‚Ä≠  Of one sole day; again:  then you should try
‚Ä≠  If the dull glebe before the plow-should fly,
‚Ä≠  Or I a long stitch could bear clean and even.
‚Ä≠  Or lastly, if the Guide of earth and heaven
‚Ä≠  Should stir stern war up, either here or there,
‚Ä≠  And that at this day I had double spear,
‚Ä≠  And shield, and steel casque fitting for my brows;
‚Ä≠  At this work likewise, ‚Äômidst the foremost blows,
‚Ä≠  Your eyes should note me, and get little cause
‚Ä≠  To twit me with my belly‚Äôs sole applause.
‚Ä≠  But you affect t‚Äô affect with injury,
‚Ä≠  Your mind ungentle, seem in valour high,
‚Ä≠  Because ‚Äôgainst few, and those not of the best,
‚Ä≠  Your conversation hath been still profest.
‚Ä≠  But if Ulysses, landed on his earth,
‚Ä≠  And enter‚Äôd on the true right of his birth,
‚Ä≠  Should come and front ye, straight his ample gates
‚Ä≠  Your feet would hold too narrow for your fates.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He frown‚Äôd, rag‚Äôd, call‚Äôd him wretch, and vow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To be his death, since he durst prove so proud
‚Ä≠  Amongst so many, to tell him so home
‚Ä≠  What he affected; ask‚Äôd, if overcome
‚Ä≠  With wine he were, or, as his minion said,
‚Ä≠  Talk‚Äôd still so idly, and were palsi√©d
‚Ä≠  In his mind‚Äôs instruments, or was proud because
‚Ä≠  He gat from Irus off with such applause?
‚Ä≠  With all which, snatching up a stool, he threw;
‚Ä≠  When old Ulysses to the knees withdrew
‚Ä≠  Of the Dulichian lord, Amphinomus,
‚Ä≠  As if he fear‚Äôd him.  His dart missing thus
‚Ä≠  His aged object, and his page‚Äôs hand
‚Ä≠  (A boy that waited on his cup‚Äôs command,
‚Ä≠  Now holding of an ewer to him) he smit,
‚Ä≠  Down fell the sounding ewer, and after it
‚Ä≠  The guiltless page lay sprawling in the dust,
‚Ä≠  And crying out.  When all the Wooers thrust
‚Ä≠  A tumult up amongst them, wishing all
‚Ä≠  The rogue had perish‚Äôd in some hospital,
‚Ä≠  Before his life there stirr‚Äôd such uproars up,
‚Ä≠  And with rude speeches spice their pleasures‚Äô cup.
‚Ä≠  And all this for a beggar to fulfill
‚Ä≠  A filthy proverb:  _Good still yields to ill._
‚Ä≠     The prince cried out on them, to let the bad
‚Ä≠  Obscure the good so; told them they were mad,
‚Ä≠  Abus‚Äôd their banquet, and affirm‚Äôd some God
‚Ä≠  Tried mast‚Äôries with them; bade them take their load
‚Ä≠  Of food and wine, sit up, or fall to bed
‚Ä≠  At their free pleasures; and since he gave head
‚Ä≠  To all their freedoms, why should they mistake
‚Ä≠  Their own rich humours for a beggar‚Äôs sake?
‚Ä≠     All bit their lips to be so taken down,
‚Ä≠  And taught the course that should have been their own,
‚Ä≠  Admir‚Äôd the prince; and said he bravely spoke.
‚Ä≠  But Nisus‚Äô son then struck the equal stroke,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúO friends, let no man here disdain
‚Ä≠  To put up equal speeches, nor maintain
‚Ä≠  With serious words an humour, nor with stroke
‚Ä≠  A stranger in another‚Äôs house provoke,
‚Ä≠  Nor touch the meanest servant, but confine
‚Ä≠  All these dissentions in a bowl of wine;
‚Ä≠  Which fill us, cup-bearer, that, having done
‚Ä≠  Our nightly sacrifice, we may atone
‚Ä≠  Our pow‚Äôrs with sleep, resigning first the guest
‚Ä≠  Up to the prince, that holds all interest
‚Ä≠  In his disposure here; the house being his
‚Ä≠  In just descent, and all the faculties.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This all approv‚Äôd; when noble Mulius,
‚Ä≠  Herald-in-chief to lord Amphinomus,
‚Ä≠  The wine distributed with rev‚Äôrend grace
‚Ä≠  To ev‚Äôry Wooer; when the Gods giv‚Äôn place;
‚Ä≠  With service fit; they serv‚Äôd themselves, and took
‚Ä≠  Their parting cups, till, when they all had shook
‚Ä≠  The angry humour off, they bent to rest,
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôry Wooer to sev‚Äôral roofs addrest.

‚Ä≠  THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS.



‚Ä≠  THE NINETEENTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS
‚Ä≠
‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Ulysses and his son eschew
‚Ä≠  Offending of the Wooers‚Äô view
‚Ä≠  With any armour.  His birth‚Äôs seat,
‚Ä≠  Ulysses tells his Queen, is Crete,
‚Ä≠  Euryclea the truth yet found,
‚Ä≠  Discover‚Äôd by a scar-heal‚Äôd wound,
‚Ä≠  Which in Parnassus‚Äô tops a boar,
‚Ä≠  Struck by him in his chace, did gore.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _Œ§Œ±œÖÃë._
‚Ä≠     The King still hid
‚Ä≠        By what he said;
‚Ä≠     By what he did
‚Ä≠        Informs his maid.

‚Ä≠  Yet did divine Ulysses keep his roof,
‚Ä≠  And with Minerva plotted still the proof
‚Ä≠  Of all the Wooers‚Äô deaths; when thus his son
‚Ä≠  He taught with these fore-counsels:  ‚ÄúWe must run
‚Ä≠  A close course with these arms, and lay them by,
‚Ä≠  And to the Wooers make so fair a sky
‚Ä≠  As it would never thunder.  Let me then,
‚Ä≠  That you may well retain, repeat again
‚Ä≠  What in Eum√¶us‚Äô cottage I advis‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠  If when they see no leisure exercis‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  In fetching down your arms, and ask what use
‚Ä≠  Your mind will give them, say, ‚Äôtis their abuse
‚Ä≠  With smoke and rust that makes you take them down,
‚Ä≠  This not being like the armory well-known
‚Ä≠  To be the leavings of Laertes‚Äô son
‚Ä≠  Consorting the design for Ilion;
‚Ä≠  Your eyes may see how much they are infected,
‚Ä≠  As all fires‚Äô vapours ever since reflected
‚Ä≠  On those sole arms.  Besides, a graver thought
‚Ä≠  Jove graves within you, lest, their spirits wrought
‚Ä≠  Above their pitch with wine, they might contend
‚Ä≠  At some high banquet, and to wounds transcend,
‚Ä≠  Their feast inverting; which, perhaps, may be
‚Ä≠  Their nuptial feast with wise Penelop√©.
‚Ä≠  _The ready weapon, when the blood is up,
‚Ä≠  Doubles the uproar heighten‚Äôd by the cup.
‚Ä≠  Wrath‚Äôs means for act, curb all the ways ye can,
‚Ä≠  As loadstones draw the steel, so steel draws man._
‚Ä≠  Retain these words; nor what is good think, thus
‚Ä≠  Receiv‚Äôd at second hand, superfluous.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The son, obeying, did Euryclea call,
‚Ä≠  And bade her shut in th‚Äô utter porches all
‚Ä≠  The other women, till himself brought down
‚Ä≠  His father‚Äôs arms, which all were overgrown
‚Ä≠  By his neglect with rust, his father gone,
‚Ä≠  And he too-childish to spend thoughts upon
‚Ä≠  Those manly implements; but he would now
‚Ä≠  Reform those young neglects, and th‚Äô arms bestow
‚Ä≠  Past reach of smoke.  The loving nurse replied:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI wish, O son, your pow‚Äôrs would once provide
‚Ä≠  For wisdom‚Äôs habit, see your household were
‚Ä≠  In thrifty manage, and tend all things there.
‚Ä≠  But if these arms must down, and ev‚Äôry maid
‚Ä≠  Be shut in utter rooms, who else should aid
‚Ä≠  Your work with light?‚Äù  He answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúThis my guest.
‚Ä≠  There shall no one in my house taste my feast,
‚Ä≠  Or join in my nave, that shall idly live,  [1]
‚Ä≠  However far hence he his home derive.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He said, and his words stood.  The doors she shut
‚Ä≠  Of that so well-fill‚Äôd house.  And th‚Äô other put
‚Ä≠  Their thoughts in act; best shields, helms, sharpen‚Äôd lances,
‚Ä≠  Brought down; and Pallas before both advances
‚Ä≠  A golden cresset, that did cast a light
‚Ä≠  As if the Day sat in the throne of Night.
‚Ä≠     When, half-amaz‚Äôd, the prince said:  ‚ÄúO my father,
‚Ä≠  Mine eyes my soul‚Äôs pow‚Äôrs all in wonder gather,
‚Ä≠  For though the walls, and goodly wind-beams here,
‚Ä≠  All all these pillars, that their heads so rear,
‚Ä≠  And all of fir, they seem yet all of fire.
‚Ä≠  Some God is surely with us.‚Äù  His wise sire
‚Ä≠  Bade peace, and keep the counsels of the Gods,
‚Ä≠  Nor ask a word:  ‚ÄúThese Pow‚Äôrs, that use abodes
‚Ä≠  Above the stars, have pow‚Äôr from thence to shine
‚Ä≠  Through night and all shades to earth‚Äôs inmost mine.
‚Ä≠  Go thou for sleep, and leave me here to wake
‚Ä≠  The women, and the Queen whose heart doth ache
‚Ä≠  To make inquiry for myself of me.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He went to sleep where lights did endlessly
‚Ä≠  Burn in his night-rooms; where he feasted rest,
‚Ä≠  Till day‚Äôs fair weed did all the world invest.
‚Ä≠  Thus was divine Ulysses left alone
‚Ä≠  With Pallas, plotting foul confusion
‚Ä≠  To all the Wooers.  Forth then came the Queen;
‚Ä≠  Ph≈ìbe, with golden Cytherea seen,
‚Ä≠  Her port presented.  Whom they set a chair
‚Ä≠  Aside the fire, the fashion circular,
‚Ä≠  The substance silver and rich elephant;
‚Ä≠  Whose fabric did the cunning finger vaunt
‚Ä≠  Of great Icmalius, who besides had done
‚Ä≠  A footstool for her that did suit her throne,
‚Ä≠  On which they cast an ample skin, to be
‚Ä≠  The cushion for her other royalty.
‚Ä≠  And there she sat; about whom came her maids,
‚Ä≠  Who brought upon a table store of breads,
‚Ä≠  And bowls that with the Wooers‚Äô wine were crown‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  The embers then they cast upon the ground
‚Ä≠  From out the lamps, and other fuel added,
‚Ä≠  That still with cheerful flame the sad house gladded.
‚Ä≠     Melantha seeing still Ulysses there,
‚Ä≠  Thus she held out her spleen:  ‚ÄúStill, stranger, here?
‚Ä≠  Thus late in night?  To see what ladies do?
‚Ä≠  Avaunt you, wretch, hence, go without doors, go;
‚Ä≠  And quickly, too, lest ye be singed away
‚Ä≠  With burning firebrands.‚Äù  He, thus seeing their fray
‚Ä≠  Continued by her with such spleen, replied:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúMinion!  What makes your angry blood thus chide
‚Ä≠  My presence still?  Is it because you see
‚Ä≠  I shine not in your wanton bravery,
‚Ä≠  But wear these rags?  It fits the needy fate
‚Ä≠  That makes me beg thus of the common state.
‚Ä≠  Such poor souls, and such beggars, yet are men;
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôn my mean means means had to maintain
‚Ä≠  A wealthy house, and kept a manly press,
‚Ä≠  Was counted blessed, and the poor access
‚Ä≠  Of any beggar did not scorn, but feed,
‚Ä≠  With often hand, and any man of need
‚Ä≠  Reliev‚Äôd as fitted; kept my servants, too,
‚Ä≠  Not few, but did with those additions go
‚Ä≠  That call choice men _The Honest_, who are styl‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The rich, the great.  But what such great ones build
‚Ä≠  Jove oft pulls down, as thus he ruin‚Äôd me;
‚Ä≠  His will was such, which is his equity.
‚Ä≠  And therefore, woman, bear you fitting hand
‚Ä≠  On your behaviour, lest your spirit thus mann‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And cherish‚Äôd with your beauties, when they wane,
‚Ä≠  Comes down, your pride now being then your bane;
‚Ä≠  And in the mean space shun the present danger,
‚Ä≠  Lest your bold fashion breed your sov‚Äôreign‚Äôs anger,
‚Ä≠  Or lest Ulysses come, of whom ev‚Äôn yet
‚Ä≠  Hope finds some life in Fate.  Or, be his seat
‚Ä≠  Amongst the merely ruin‚Äôd, yet his son,
‚Ä≠  Whose life‚Äôs heat Ph≈ìbus saves, is such a one
‚Ä≠  As can discover who doth well deserve
‚Ä≠  Of any woman here his years now serve.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The Queen gave ear, and thus suppress‚Äôd the flame:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThou quite without a brow, past female shame,
‚Ä≠  I hear thy monstrous boldness, which thy head
‚Ä≠  Shall pay me pains for.  Thou hast heard it said,
‚Ä≠  And from myself too, and ev‚Äôry part
‚Ä≠  Thy knowledge serves thee, that, to ease my heart
‚Ä≠  So punish‚Äôd in thy witness, my desire
‚Ä≠  Dwelt on this stranger, that I might inquire
‚Ä≠  My lost friend‚Äôs being.  But ‚Äôtis ever tried,
‚Ä≠  _Both man and God are still forgot with pride._
‚Ä≠  Eurynom√©, bring here this guest a seat,
‚Ä≠  And cushion on it, that we two may treat
‚Ä≠  Of the affair in question.  Set it near,
‚Ä≠  That I may softly speak, yet he well hear.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She did this little freely; and he sat
‚Ä≠  Close by the Queen, who ask‚Äôd him, Whence, and what
‚Ä≠  He was himself?  And what th‚Äô inhabited place
‚Ä≠  Where liv‚Äôd his parents?  Whence he fetch‚Äôd his race?
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO woman,‚Äù  he replied,  ‚Äúwith whom no man,
‚Ä≠  That moves in earth‚Äôs unbounded circle, can
‚Ä≠  Maintain contention for true honour giv‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  Whose fame hath reach‚Äôd the fairly-flowing heav‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  Who, like a never-ill-deserving king,
‚Ä≠  That is well-spoke of, first, for worshipping,
‚Ä≠  And striving to resemble God in empire;
‚Ä≠  Whose equal hand impartially doth temper
‚Ä≠  Greatness and Goodness; to whom therefore bears
‚Ä≠  The black earth store of all grain, trees confers
‚Ä≠  Cracking with burthen, long-liv‚Äôd herds creates,
‚Ä≠  All which the sea with her sorts emulates;
‚Ä≠  And all this feeds beneath his pow‚Äôrful hand
‚Ä≠  Men, valiant, many, making strong his land
‚Ä≠  With happy lives led; nothing else the cause
‚Ä≠  Of all these blessings, but well-order‚Äôd laws;
‚Ä≠  Like such a king are you, in love, in fame,
‚Ä≠  And all the bliss that deifies a dame.
‚Ä≠  And therefore do not mix this with a moan
‚Ä≠  So wretched as is now in question;
‚Ä≠  Ask not my race nor country, lest you fill
‚Ä≠  My heart yet fuller with repeated ill;
‚Ä≠  For I must follow it with many tears,
‚Ä≠  Though ‚Äôtis not seemly to sit wounding ears
‚Ä≠  In public roofs with our particular life.
‚Ä≠  _Time‚Äôs worst expense is still-repeated grief._
‚Ä≠  I should be irksome to your ladies here,
‚Ä≠  And you yourself would say you urg‚Äôd your ear
‚Ä≠  To what offends it, my still-broken eyne
‚Ä≠  Supposing wounded with your too-much wine.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúStranger,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúyou fear your own excess
‚Ä≠  With giving me too great a nobleness.
‚Ä≠  The Gods my person, beauty, virtue too,
‚Ä≠  Long since subverted, when the Ilion woe
‚Ä≠  The Greek design attempted; in which went
‚Ä≠  My praise and honour.  In his government
‚Ä≠  Had I deserv‚Äôd your utmost grace, but now
‚Ä≠  Sinister Deity makes dishonour woo,
‚Ä≠  In show of grace, my ruin.  All the peers
‚Ä≠  Sylvan Zacynthus, and Dulichius, spheres,
‚Ä≠  Samos and Ithaca, strange strifes have shown
‚Ä≠  To win me, spending on me all mine own;
‚Ä≠  Will wed me, in my spite; and these are those
‚Ä≠  That take from me all virtue to dispose
‚Ä≠  Or guest or suppliant, or take any course
‚Ä≠  Amongst my heralds, that should all disburse,
‚Ä≠  To order anything.  Though I need none
‚Ä≠  To give me grief at home, abroad errs one
‚Ä≠  That my veins shrink for, whom these holding gone,
‚Ä≠  Their nuptials hasten, and find me as slow.
‚Ä≠  Good spirits prompted me to make a show
‚Ä≠  Of undertaking a most curious task,
‚Ä≠  That an unmeasur‚Äôd space of time would ask;
‚Ä≠  Which they enduring long would often say,
‚Ä≠  When ends thy work?  I soon had my delay,
‚Ä≠  And pray‚Äôd their stay; for though my lord were dead,
‚Ä≠  His father‚Äôs life yet matter ministred
‚Ä≠  That must employ me; which, to tell them true,
‚Ä≠  Was that great work I nam‚Äôd.  For now near drew
‚Ä≠  Laertes‚Äô death, and on my hand did lie
‚Ä≠  His funeral-robe, whose end, being now so nigh,
‚Ä≠  I must not leave, and lose so much begun,
‚Ä≠  The rather lest the Greek dames might be won
‚Ä≠  To tax mine honour, if a man so great
‚Ä≠  Should greet his grave without his winding sheet.
‚Ä≠  Pride made them credulous, and I went on;
‚Ä≠  When whatsoever all the day had done
‚Ä≠  I made the night help to undo again,
‚Ä≠  Though oil and watch it cost, and equal pain.
‚Ä≠  Three years my wit secur‚Äôd me undiscern‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Yet, when the fourth came, by my maids discern‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  False careless wenches, how they were deluded;
‚Ä≠  When, by my light discern‚Äôd, they all intruded,
‚Ä≠  Used threat‚Äôning words, and made me give it end;
‚Ä≠  And then could I to no more length extend
‚Ä≠  My linger‚Äôd nuptials; not a counsel more
‚Ä≠  Was to be stood upon; my parents bore
‚Ä≠  Continual hand on me to make me wed;
‚Ä≠  My son grew angry that so ruin√©d
‚Ä≠  His goods were by them.  He is now a man
‚Ä≠  Wise in a great degree, and one that can
‚Ä≠  Himself give order to his household fare;
‚Ä≠  And Jove give equal glory to his care.
‚Ä≠  But thus you must not pass me; I must know,
‚Ä≠  It may be for more end, from whence doth grow
‚Ä≠  Your race and you; for I suppose you none
‚Ä≠  Sprung of old oak, or justled out of stone.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúO Ulysses‚Äô rev‚Äôrend wife!
‚Ä≠  Yet hold you purpose to inquire my life?
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll tell you, though it much afflict me more
‚Ä≠  Than all the sorrows I have felt before.
‚Ä≠  As worthily it may, since so long time
‚Ä≠  As I have wander‚Äôd from my native clime,
‚Ä≠  Through human cities, and in suff‚Äôrance still,
‚Ä≠  To rip all wounds up, though of all their ill
‚Ä≠  I touch but part, must actuate all their pain.
‚Ä≠  But, ask you still, I‚Äôll tell, though still sustain.
‚Ä≠     In middle of the sable sea there lies
‚Ä≠  An isle call‚Äôd Crete, a ravisher of eyes,
‚Ä≠  Fruitful, and mann‚Äôd with many an infinite store;
‚Ä≠  Where ninety cities crown the famous shore,
‚Ä≠  Mix‚Äôd with all-languag‚Äôd men.  There Greeks survive,
‚Ä≠  There the great-minded Eteocretans live,
‚Ä≠  There the Dorensians never out of war,
‚Ä≠  The Cydons there, and there the singular
‚Ä≠  Pelasgian people.  There doth Cnossus stand,
‚Ä≠  That mighty city, where had most command
‚Ä≠  Great Jove‚Äôs disciple, Minos, who nine years
‚Ä≠  Conferr‚Äôd with Jove, both great familiars
‚Ä≠  In mutual counsels.  And this Minos‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  The mighty-minded king Deucalion,
‚Ä≠  Was sire to me and royal Idomen,
‚Ä≠  Who with Atrides went to Ilion then,
‚Ä≠  My elder brother and the better man,
‚Ä≠  My name Aethon.  At that time began
‚Ä≠  My knowledge of Ulysses, whom my home
‚Ä≠  Receiv‚Äôd with guest-rites.  He was thither come
‚Ä≠  By force of weather, from the Malean coast
‚Ä≠  But new got off, where he the navy lost,
‚Ä≠  Then under sail for Troy, and wind-bound lay
‚Ä≠  Long in Amnisus; hardly got away
‚Ä≠  From horrid storms, that made him anchor there,
‚Ä≠  In havens that sacred to Lucina were,
‚Ä≠  Dreadful and dang‚Äôrous, in whose bosom crept
‚Ä≠  Lucina‚Äôs cavern.  But in my roof slept
‚Ä≠  Ulysses, shor‚Äôd in Crete; who first inquir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  For royal Idomen, and much desir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To taste his guest-rites, since to him had been
‚Ä≠  A welcome guest my brother Idomen.
‚Ä≠  The tenth or ‚Äôleventh light on Ulysses shin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In stay at Crete, attending then the wind
‚Ä≠  For threaten‚Äôd Ilion.  All which time my house
‚Ä≠  With love and entertainments curious
‚Ä≠  Embrac‚Äôd his person, though a number more
‚Ä≠  My hospitable roofs receiv‚Äôd before,
‚Ä≠  His men I likewise call‚Äôd, and from the store
‚Ä≠  Allow‚Äôd them meal and heat-exciting wine,
‚Ä≠  And oxen for their slaughter, to confine
‚Ä≠  In my free hand the utmost of their need.
‚Ä≠  Twelve days the Greeks stay‚Äôd, ere they got them freed,
‚Ä≠  A gale so bitter blew out of the north,
‚Ä≠  That none could stand on earth, being tumbled forth
‚Ä≠  By some stern God.  But on the thirteenth day
‚Ä≠  The tempest ceas‚Äôd, and then went Greeks their way.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus many tales Ulysses told his wife,
‚Ä≠  At most but painting, yet most like the life;
‚Ä≠  Of which her heart such sense took through her ears,
‚Ä≠  It made her weep as she would turn to tears.
‚Ä≠  And as from off the mountains melts the snow,
‚Ä≠  Which Zephyr‚Äôs breath conceal‚Äôd, but was made flow
‚Ä≠  By hollow Eurus, which so fast pours down,
‚Ä≠  That with their torrent floods have overflown;
‚Ä≠  So down her fair cheeks her kind tears did glide,
‚Ä≠  Her miss‚Äôd lord mourning set so near her side.
‚Ä≠     Ulysses much was mov‚Äôd to see her mourn,
‚Ä≠  Whose eyes yet stood as dry as iron or horn
‚Ä≠  In his untroubled lids, which in his craft
‚Ä≠  Of bridling passion he from issue saft.
‚Ä≠     When she had giv‚Äôn her moan so many tears,
‚Ä≠  That now ‚Äôtwas satiate, her yet loving fears
‚Ä≠  Ask‚Äôd thus much further:  ‚ÄúYou have thus far tried
‚Ä≠  My love‚Äôs credulity, but if gratified
‚Ä≠  With so long stay he was with you, you can
‚Ä≠  Describe what weed he wore, what kind of man
‚Ä≠  Both he himself was, and what followers
‚Ä≠  Observ‚Äôd him there.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAlas,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúthe years
‚Ä≠  Have grown so many since--this making now
‚Ä≠  Their twentieth revolution--that my show
‚Ä≠  Of these slight notes will set my memory sore,
‚Ä≠  But, to my now remembrance, this he wore:
‚Ä≠  A double purple robe, drawn close before
‚Ä≠  With golden buttons, plaited thick, and bore
‚Ä≠  A facing where a hundred colours shin‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  About the skirts a hound a freckled hind
‚Ä≠  In full course hunted; on the fore skirts, yet,
‚Ä≠  He pinch‚Äôd and pull‚Äôd her down, when with her feet,
‚Ä≠  And all her force, she struggled hard for flight.
‚Ä≠  Which had such life in gold, that to the sight
‚Ä≠  It seem‚Äôd the hind itself for ev‚Äôry hue,
‚Ä≠  The hound and all so answering the view,
‚Ä≠  That all admir‚Äôd all.  I observ‚Äôd beside
‚Ä≠  His inner weed, so rarely beautified
‚Ä≠  That dumb amaze it bred, and was as thin
‚Ä≠  As any dry and tender onion skin;
‚Ä≠  As soft ‚Äôtwas, too, and glister‚Äôd like the sun.
‚Ä≠  The women were to loving wonder won
‚Ä≠  By him and by his weeds.  But, by the way,
‚Ä≠  You must excuse me, that I cannot say
‚Ä≠  He brought this suit from home, or had it there
‚Ä≠  Sent for some present, or, perhaps, elsewhere
‚Ä≠  Receiv‚Äôd it for his guest-gift; for your lord
‚Ä≠  Had friends not few, the fleet did not afford
‚Ä≠  Many that had not fewer.  I bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A well-edg‚Äôd sword on him, a robe that flow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In folds and fulness, and did reach his feet,
‚Ä≠  Of richest purple; brought him to his fleet
‚Ä≠  With all my honour; and besides, to add
‚Ä≠  To all this sifted circumstance, he had
‚Ä≠  A herald there, in height a little more
‚Ä≠  Put from the earth, that thicker shoulders wore,
‚Ä≠  A swarth complexion and a curl√©d head,
‚Ä≠  His name Eurybates; and much in stead
‚Ä≠  He stood your king, employ‚Äôd in most command,
‚Ä≠  Since most of all his mind could understand.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     When all these signs she knew for chiefly true,
‚Ä≠  Desire of moan upon her beauties grew,
‚Ä≠  And yet, ev‚Äôn that desire suffic‚Äôd, she said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúTill this, my guest, a wretched state array‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Your ill-us‚Äôd person, but from this hour forth
‚Ä≠  You shall be honour‚Äôd, and find all the worth
‚Ä≠  That fits a friend.  Those weeds these hands bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  From out my wardrobe; those gold buttons sew‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Before for closure and for ornament.
‚Ä≠  But never more must his return present
‚Ä≠  The person that gave those adornments state;
‚Ä≠  And therefore, under an abhorr√©d fate,
‚Ä≠  Was he induc‚Äôd to feed the common fame,
‚Ä≠  To visit vile Troy, ay too vile to name.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúNo more yet mourn,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúnor thus see pin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Your lovely person.  _Weeping wastes the mind._
‚Ä≠  And yet I blame you not; for any dame
‚Ä≠  That weds one young, and brings to him his name,
‚Ä≠  Whatever man he is, will mourn his loss.
‚Ä≠  Much more respectful then must show your woes
‚Ä≠  That weep thus for Ulysses, who, Fame says,
‚Ä≠  Was equal with the Gods in all his ways.
‚Ä≠  But where no cause is there must be no moan,
‚Ä≠  And therefore hear me, my relation
‚Ä≠  Shall lay the clear truth naked to your view:
‚Ä≠  I heard amongst the Thesprots for most true,
‚Ä≠  That lord Ulysses liv‚Äôd, and stood just now
‚Ä≠  On his return for home; that wealth did flow
‚Ä≠  In his possession, which he made not known,
‚Ä≠  But begg‚Äôd amongst the people, since alone
‚Ä≠  He quite was left, for all his men were lost
‚Ä≠  In getting off from the Trinacrian coast;
‚Ä≠  Jove and the Sun was wroth with them for rape
‚Ä≠  Made of his oxen, and no man let ‚Äôscape
‚Ä≠  The rugged deeps of Neptune; only he,
‚Ä≠  The ship‚Äôs keel only keeping, was by sea
‚Ä≠  Cast on the fair Ph√¶acian continent,
‚Ä≠  Where men survive that are the Gods‚Äô descent,
‚Ä≠  And like a God receiv‚Äôd him, gave him heaps
‚Ä≠  Of wealthy gifts, and would conduct his steps
‚Ä≠  Themselves safe home; which he might long ago
‚Ä≠  His pleasure make, but profit would not so.
‚Ä≠  He gather‚Äôd going, and had mighty store
‚Ä≠  Of gold in safeguard; so beyond the shore
‚Ä≠  That common sails kept, his high flood of wit
‚Ä≠  Bore glorious top, and all the world for it
‚Ä≠  Hath far exceeded.  All this Ph√¶don told,
‚Ä≠  That doth the sceptre of Thesprotia hold,
‚Ä≠  Who swore to me, in household sacrifice,
‚Ä≠  The ship was launch‚Äôd, and men to man the prise,
‚Ä≠  That soon should set him on his country earth,
‚Ä≠  Show‚Äôd me the goods, enough to serve the birth
‚Ä≠  That in the tenth age of his seed should spring,
‚Ä≠  Yet in his court contain‚Äôd.  But then the king,
‚Ä≠  Your husband, for Dodona was in way,
‚Ä≠  That from th‚Äô Oraculous Oak he might display
‚Ä≠  Jove‚Äôs will what course for home would best prevail,
‚Ä≠  To come in pomp, or bear a secret sail.
‚Ä≠  But me the king dispatch‚Äôd in course before,
‚Ä≠  A ship then bound for the Dulichian shore.
‚Ä≠  So thus you see his safety whom you mourn;
‚Ä≠  Who now is passing near, and his return
‚Ä≠  No more will punish with delays, but see
‚Ä≠  His friends and country.  All which truth to thee
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll seal with sacred oath.  Be witness, Jove,
‚Ä≠  Thou first and best of all the thron‚Äôd above!
‚Ä≠  And thou house of the great Laertes‚Äô heir,
‚Ä≠  To whose high roofs I tender my repair,
‚Ä≠  That what I tell the Queen event shall crown!
‚Ä≠  This year Ulysses shall possess his own,
‚Ä≠  Nay ere the next month ends shall here arrive,
‚Ä≠  Nay, ere it enters, here abide alive!‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO may this prove,‚Äù  said she;  ‚Äúgifts, friendship, then
‚Ä≠  Should make your name the most renown‚Äôd of men.
‚Ä≠  But ‚Äôtis of me receiv‚Äôd, and must so sort,
‚Ä≠  That nor my lord shall ever see his court,
‚Ä≠  Nor you gain your deduction thence, for now
‚Ä≠  The alter‚Äôd house doth no such man allow
‚Ä≠  As was Ulysses, if he ever were,
‚Ä≠  To entertain a rev‚Äôrend passenger,
‚Ä≠  And give him fair dismission.  But, maids, see
‚Ä≠  Ye bathe his feet, and then with tapestry,
‚Ä≠  Best sheets and blankets, make his bed, and lay
‚Ä≠  Soft waistcoats by him, that, lodg‚Äôd warm, he may
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn till the golden-seated morning‚Äôs ray
‚Ä≠  Enjoy good rest; and then, with her first light,
‚Ä≠  Bathe, and give alms, that cherish‚Äôd appetite
‚Ä≠  He may apply within our hall, and sit
‚Ä≠  Safe by Telemachus.  Or, if th‚Äô unfit
‚Ä≠  And harmful mind of any be so base
‚Ä≠  To grieve his age again, let none give grace
‚Ä≠  Of doing any deed he shall command,
‚Ä≠  How wroth soever, to his barbarous hand.
‚Ä≠  For how shall you, guest, know me for a dame
‚Ä≠  That pass so far, nay, turn and wind the fame
‚Ä≠  Of other dames for wisdom, and the frame
‚Ä≠  Of household usage, if your poor thin weeds
‚Ä≠  I let draw on you want, and worser deeds,
‚Ä≠  That may, perhaps, cause here your latest day?
‚Ä≠  _The life of man is short and flies away._
‚Ä≠  And if the ruler‚Äôs self of households be
‚Ä≠  Ungentle, studying inhumanity,
‚Ä≠  The rest prove worse, but he bears all the blame;
‚Ä≠  All men will, living, vow against his name
‚Ä≠  Mischiefs and miseries, and, dead, supply
‚Ä≠  With bitter epitaphs his memory.
‚Ä≠  But if himself be noble--noble things
‚Ä≠  Doing and knowing--all his underlings
‚Ä≠  Will imitate his noblesse, and all guests
‚Ä≠  Give it, in many, many interests.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúBut, worthiest Queen,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúwhere you command
‚Ä≠  Baths and rich beds for me, I scorn to stand
‚Ä≠  On such state now nor ever thought it yet,
‚Ä≠  Since first I left the snowy hills of Crete.
‚Ä≠  When once I fell a-shipboard those thoughts fled;
‚Ä≠  I love to take now, as long since, my bed.
‚Ä≠  Though I began the use with sleepless nights,
‚Ä≠  I many a darkness with right homely rites
‚Ä≠  Have spent ere this hour, and desir‚Äôd the morn
‚Ä≠  Would come, and make sleep to the world a scorn.
‚Ä≠  Nor run these dainty baths in my rude head;
‚Ä≠  Nor any handmaid, to your service bred,
‚Ä≠  Shall touch my ill-kept feet, unless there live
‚Ä≠  Some poor old drudge here, that hath learn‚Äôd to give
‚Ä≠  Old men good usage, and no work will fly,
‚Ä≠  As having suffer‚Äôd ill as much as I.
‚Ä≠  But if there live one such in your command,
‚Ä≠  I will not shame to give my foot her hand.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She gave this answer:  ‚ÄúO my lov√©d guest,
‚Ä≠  There never enter‚Äôd these kind roofs for rest
‚Ä≠  Stranger or friend that so much wisdom laid
‚Ä≠  In gage for guest-rites, as your lips have paid.
‚Ä≠  There lives an old maid in my charge that knows
‚Ä≠  The good you speak of by her many woes;
‚Ä≠  That nourish‚Äôd and brought up, with curious care,
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô unhappy man; your old familiar,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn since his mother let him view the light,
‚Ä≠  And oft hath felt in her weak arms his weight;
‚Ä≠  And she, though now much weaker, shall apply
‚Ä≠  Her maiden service to your modesty.
‚Ä≠  Euryclea, rise, and wash the feet of one
‚Ä≠  That is of one age with your sov‚Äôreign gone,
‚Ä≠  Such hands, such feet hath, though of alter‚Äôd grace.
‚Ä≠  _Much grief in men will bring on change apace.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     She, from her aged slumber wak‚Äôd, did clear
‚Ä≠  Her heavy eyes, and instantly, to hear
‚Ä≠  Her sov‚Äôreign‚Äôs name, had work enough to dry
‚Ä≠  Her cheeks from tears, and to his memory
‚Ä≠  These moans did offer:  ‚ÄúO my son,‚Äù  said she,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúI never can take grief enough for thee,
‚Ä≠  Whom Goodness hurts, and whom ev‚Äôn Jove‚Äôs high spleen,
‚Ä≠  Since thou art Jove-like, hates the most of men.
‚Ä≠  For none hath offer‚Äôd him so many thighs,
‚Ä≠  Nor such whole hecatombs of sacrifice,
‚Ä≠  Fat and selected, as thy zeal hath done;
‚Ä≠  For all, but praying that thy noble son,
‚Ä≠  Thy happy age might see at state of man.
‚Ä≠  And yet hath Jove with mists Cimmerian
‚Ä≠  Put out the light of his returning day.
‚Ä≠  And as yourself, O father, in your way
‚Ä≠  Took these fair roofs for hospitable rites,
‚Ä≠  Yet find, for them, our dogged women‚Äôs spites;
‚Ä≠  So he, in like course, being driven to proof,
‚Ä≠  Long time ere this, what such a royal roof
‚Ä≠  Would yield his mis‚Äôries, found such usage there.
‚Ä≠  And you, now flying the foul language here,
‚Ä≠  And many a filthy fact of our fair dames,
‚Ä≠  Fly me like them, and put on causeless shames
‚Ä≠  To let me cleanse your feet.  For not the cause
‚Ä≠  The Queen‚Äôs command yields is the pow‚Äôr that draws
‚Ä≠  My will to wash your feet, but what I do
‚Ä≠  Proceeds from her charge and your rev‚Äôrence too;
‚Ä≠  Since I in soul am stricken with a ruth
‚Ä≠  Of your distresses, and past show of truth;  [2]
‚Ä≠  Your strangeness claiming little interest
‚Ä≠  In my affections.  And yet many a guest
‚Ä≠  Of poor condition hath been harbour‚Äôd here,
‚Ä≠  But never any did so right appear
‚Ä≠  Like king Ulysses as yourself, for state
‚Ä≠  Both of your stature, voice, and very gait.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúSo all have said,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúthat ever yet
‚Ä≠  Had the proportions of our figures met
‚Ä≠  In their observance; so right your eye
‚Ä≠  Proves in your soul your judging faculty.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus took she up a caldron brightly scour‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  To cleanse his feet in; and into it pour‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Store of cold wave, which on the fire she set;
‚Ä≠  And therein bath‚Äôd, being temperately heat,
‚Ä≠  Her sov‚Äôreign‚Äôs feet.  Who turn‚Äôd him from the light,
‚Ä≠  Since suddenly he doubted her conceit,
‚Ä≠  So rightly touching at his state before,
‚Ä≠  A scar now seeing on his foot, that bore
‚Ä≠  An old note, to discern him, might descry
‚Ä≠  The absolute truth; which, witness‚Äôd by her eye,
‚Ä≠  Was straight approv‚Äôd.  He first receiv‚Äôd this sore
‚Ä≠  As in Parnassus‚Äô tops a white-tooth‚Äôd boar
‚Ä≠  He stood in chase withal, who struck him there,
‚Ä≠  At such time as he liv‚Äôd a sojourner
‚Ä≠  With his grandsire, Autolycus; who th‚Äô art
‚Ä≠  Of theft and swearing (not out of the heart,
‚Ä≠  But by equivocation) first adorn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Your witty man withal, and was suborn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By Jove‚Äôs descent, ingenious Mercury,
‚Ä≠  Who did bestow it, since so many a thigh
‚Ä≠  Of lambs and kids he had on him bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In sacred flames, who therefore when he vow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Was ever with him.  And this man impos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô name, the light being first disclos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To his first sight then, when his grandsire came
‚Ä≠  To see the then preferrer of his fame,
‚Ä≠  His lov√©d daughter.  The first supper done,
‚Ä≠  Euryclea put in his lap her son,
‚Ä≠  And pray‚Äôd him to bethink and give his name,
‚Ä≠  Since that desire did all desires inflame.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúDaughter and son-in-law,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúlet then
‚Ä≠  The name that I shall give him stand with men.
‚Ä≠  Since I arriv‚Äôd here at the hour of pain,
‚Ä≠  In which mine own kind entrails did sustain
‚Ä≠  Moan for my daughter‚Äôs yet unended throes,
‚Ä≠  And when so many men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs woes,
‚Ä≠  In joint compassion met of human birth,
‚Ä≠  Brought forth t‚Äô attend the many-feeding earth,
‚Ä≠  Let Odyss√´us be his name, as one  [3]
‚Ä≠  Expos‚Äôd to just constraint of all men‚Äôs moan.
‚Ä≠  When here at home he is arriv‚Äôd at state
‚Ä≠  Of man‚Äôs first youth he shall initiate
‚Ä≠  His practis‚Äôd feet in travel made abroad,
‚Ä≠  And to Parnassus, where mine own abode
‚Ä≠  And chief means lie, address his way, where I
‚Ä≠  Will give him from my open‚Äôd treasury
‚Ä≠  What shall return him well, and fit the fame
‚Ä≠  Of one that had the honour of his name.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     For these fair gifts he went, and found all grace
‚Ä≠  Of hands and words in him and all his race.
‚Ä≠  Amphithea, his mother‚Äôs mother, too,
‚Ä≠  Applied her to his love, withal, to do
‚Ä≠  In grandame‚Äôs welcomes, both his fair eyes kist,
‚Ä≠  And brows; and then commanded to assist
‚Ä≠  Were all her sons by their respected sire
‚Ä≠  In furnishing a feast, whose ears did fire
‚Ä≠  Their minds with his command; who home straight led
‚Ä≠  A five-years-old male ox, fell‚Äôd, slew, and flay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Gather‚Äôd about him, cut him up with art,
‚Ä≠  Spitted, and roasted, and his ev‚Äôry part
‚Ä≠  Divided orderly.  So all the day
‚Ä≠  They spent in feast; no one man went his way
‚Ä≠  Without his fit fill.  When the sun was set,
‚Ä≠  And darkness rose, they slept, till day‚Äôs fire het
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô enlighten‚Äôd earth; and then on hunting went
‚Ä≠  Both hounds and all Autolycus‚Äô descent.
‚Ä≠  In whose guide did divine Ulysses go,
‚Ä≠  Climb‚Äôd steep Parnassus, on whose forehead grow
‚Ä≠  All sylvan offsprings round.  And Soon they reach‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The concaves, whence air‚Äôs sounding vapours fetch‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Their loud descent.  As soon as any sun
‚Ä≠  Had from the ocean, where his waters run
‚Ä≠  In silent deepness, rais‚Äôd his golden head,
‚Ä≠  The early huntsmen all the hill had spread,
‚Ä≠  Their hounds before them on the searching trail,
‚Ä≠  They near, and ever eager to assail:
‚Ä≠  Ulysses brandishing a lengthful lance,
‚Ä≠  Of whose first flight he long‚Äôd to prove the chance.
‚Ä≠     Then found they lodg‚Äôd a boar of bulk extreme,
‚Ä≠  In such a queach as never any beam
‚Ä≠  The sun shot pierc‚Äôd, nor any pass let find
‚Ä≠  The moist impressions of the fiercest wind,
‚Ä≠  Nor any storm the sternest winter drives,
‚Ä≠  Such proof it was; yet all within lay leaves
‚Ä≠  In mighty thickness; and through all this flew
‚Ä≠  The hounds‚Äô loud mouths.  The sounds the tumult threw,
‚Ä≠  And all together, rous‚Äôd the boar, that rush‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Amongst their thickest, all his bristles push‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  From forth his rough neck, and with flaming eyes
‚Ä≠  Stood close, and dar‚Äôd all.  On which horrid prise
‚Ä≠  Ulysses first charg‚Äôd; whom above the knee
‚Ä≠  The savage struck, and rac‚Äôd it crookedly
‚Ä≠  Along the skin, yet never reach‚Äôd the bone.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô lance yet through him quite was thrown,
‚Ä≠  At his right shoulder ent‚Äôring, at his left
‚Ä≠  The bright head passage to his keenness cleft,
‚Ä≠  And show‚Äôd his point gilt with the gushing gore.
‚Ä≠  Down in the dust fell the extended boar,
‚Ä≠  And forth his life flew.  To Ulysses round
‚Ä≠  His uncle drew; who, woeful for his wound,
‚Ä≠  With all art bound it up, and with a charm
‚Ä≠  Stay‚Äôd straight the blood, went home, and, when the harm
‚Ä≠  Receiv‚Äôd full cure, with gifts, and all event
‚Ä≠  Of joy and love to his lov‚Äôd home they sent
‚Ä≠  Their honour‚Äôd nephew; whose return his sire
‚Ä≠  And rev‚Äôrend mother took with joys entire,
‚Ä≠  Enquir‚Äôd all passages, all which he gave
‚Ä≠  In good relation, nor of all would save
‚Ä≠  His wound from utt‚Äôrance; by whose scar he came
‚Ä≠  To be discover‚Äôd by this aged dame.
‚Ä≠     Which when she cleansing felt, and noted well,
‚Ä≠  Down from her lap into the caldron fell
‚Ä≠  His weighty foot, that made the brass resound,
‚Ä≠  Turn‚Äôd all aside, and on th‚Äô embrew√©d ground
‚Ä≠  Spilt all the water.  Joy and grief together
‚Ä≠  Her breast invaded; and of weeping weather
‚Ä≠  Her eyes stood full; her small voice stuck within
‚Ä≠  Her part expressive; till at length his chin
‚Ä≠  She took and spake to him:  ‚ÄúO son,‚Äù  said she,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThou art Ulysses, nor canst other be;
‚Ä≠  Nor could I know thee yet, till all my king
‚Ä≠  I had gone over with the warm√©d spring.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Then look‚Äôd she for the Queen to tell her all;
‚Ä≠  And yet knew nothing sure, though nought could fall
‚Ä≠  In compass of all thoughts to make her doubt,
‚Ä≠  Minerva that distraction struck throughout
‚Ä≠  Her mind‚Äôs rapt forces that she might not tell.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses, noting yet her aptness well,
‚Ä≠  With one hand took her chin, and made all show
‚Ä≠  Of favour to her, with the other drew
‚Ä≠  Her offer‚Äôd parting closer, ask‚Äôd her why
‚Ä≠  She, whose kind breast had nurs‚Äôd so tenderly
‚Ä≠  His infant life, would now his age destroy,
‚Ä≠  Though twenty years had held him from the joy
‚Ä≠  Of his lov‚Äôd country?  But, since only she,
‚Ä≠  God putting her in mind, now knew ‚Äôtwas he,
‚Ä≠  He charg‚Äôd her silence, and to let no ear
‚Ä≠  In all the court more know his being there,
‚Ä≠  Lest, if God gave into his wreakful hand
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô insulting Wooers‚Äô lives, he did not stand
‚Ä≠  On any partial respect with her,
‚Ä≠  Because his nurse, and to the rest prefer
‚Ä≠  Her safety therefore, but, when they should feel
‚Ä≠  His punishing finger, give her equal steel.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúWhat words,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúfly your retentive pow‚Äôrs?
‚Ä≠  You know you lock your counsels in your tow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  In my firm bosom, and that I am far
‚Ä≠  From those loose frailties.  Like an iron bar,
‚Ä≠  Or bolt of solid‚Äôst stone, I will contain;
‚Ä≠  And tell you this besides; that if you gain,
‚Ä≠  By God‚Äôs good aid, the Wooers‚Äô lives in yours,
‚Ä≠  What dames are here their shameless paramours;
‚Ä≠  And have done most dishonour to your worth,
‚Ä≠  My information well shall paint you forth.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúIt shall not need,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúmyself will soon,
‚Ä≠  While thus I mask here, set on ev‚Äôry one
‚Ä≠  My sure observance of the worst and best.
‚Ä≠  Be thou then silent, and leave God the rest.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, the old dame for more water went,
‚Ä≠  The rest was all upon the pavement spent
‚Ä≠  By known Ulysses‚Äô foot.  More brought, and he
‚Ä≠  Supplied beside with sweetest ointments, she
‚Ä≠  His seat drew near the fire, to keep him warm,
‚Ä≠  And with his piec‚Äôd rags hiding close his harm.
‚Ä≠  The Queen came near, and said:  ‚ÄúYet, guest, afford
‚Ä≠  Your further patience, till but in a word
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll tell my woes to you; for well I know
‚Ä≠  That Rest‚Äôs sweet hour her soft foot orders now,
‚Ä≠  When all poor men, how much soever griev‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Would gladly get their woe-watch‚Äôd pow‚Äôrs reliev‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  But God hath giv‚Äôn my grief a heart so great
‚Ä≠  It will not down with rest, and so I set
‚Ä≠  My judgment up to make it my delight.
‚Ä≠  All day I mourn, yet nothing let the right
‚Ä≠  I owe my charge both in my work and maids;
‚Ä≠  And when the night brings rest to others‚Äô aids
‚Ä≠  I toss my bed; Distress, with twenty points,
‚Ä≠  Slaught‚Äôring the pow‚Äôrs that to my turning joints
‚Ä≠  Convey the vital heat.  And as all night
‚Ä≠  Pandareus‚Äô daughter, poor Edone, sings,
‚Ä≠  Clad in the verdure of the yearly springs,
‚Ä≠  When she for Itylus, her lov√©d son,
‚Ä≠  By Zethus‚Äô issue in his madness done
‚Ä≠  To cruel death, pours out her hourly moan,
‚Ä≠  And draws the ears to her of ev‚Äôry one;
‚Ä≠  So flows my moan that cuts in two my mind,
‚Ä≠  And here and there gives my discourse the wind,
‚Ä≠  Uncertain whether I shall with my son
‚Ä≠  Abide still here, the safe possession
‚Ä≠  And guard of all goods, rev‚Äôrence to the bed
‚Ä≠  Of my lov‚Äôd lord, and to my far-off spread
‚Ä≠  Fame with the people, putting still in use,
‚Ä≠  Or follow any best Greek I can chuse
‚Ä≠  To his fit house, with treasure infinite,
‚Ä≠  Won to his nuptials.  While the infant plight
‚Ä≠  And want of judgment kept my son in guide,
‚Ä≠  He was not willing with my being a bride,
‚Ä≠  Nor with my parting from his court; but now,
‚Ä≠  Arriv‚Äôd at man‚Äôs state, he would have me vow
‚Ä≠  My love to some one of my Wooers here,
‚Ä≠  And leave his court; offended that their cheer
‚Ä≠  Should so consume his free possessions.
‚Ä≠  To settle then a choice in these my moans,
‚Ä≠  Hear and expound a dream that did engrave
‚Ä≠  My sleeping fancy:  Twenty geese I have,
‚Ä≠  All which, me thought, mine eye saw tasting wheat
‚Ä≠  In water steep‚Äôd, and joy‚Äôd to see them eat;
‚Ä≠  When straight a crook-beak‚Äôd eagle from a hill
‚Ä≠  Stoop‚Äôd, and truss‚Äôd all their necks, and all did kill;
‚Ä≠  When, all left scatter‚Äôd on the pavement there,
‚Ä≠  She took her wing up to the Gods‚Äô fair sphere.
‚Ä≠  I, ev‚Äôn amid my dream, did weep and mourn
‚Ä≠  To see the eagle, with so shrewd a turn,
‚Ä≠  Stoop my sad turrets; when, methought, there came
‚Ä≠  About my mournings many a Grecian dame,
‚Ä≠  To cheer my sorrows; in whose most extreme
‚Ä≠  The hawk came back, and on the prominent beam
‚Ä≠  That cross‚Äôd my chamber fell, and us‚Äôd to me
‚Ä≠  A human voice, that sounded horribly,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄòBe confident, Icarius‚Äô seed,
‚Ä≠  This is no dream, but what shall chance indeed.
‚Ä≠  The geese the Wooers are, the eagle, I,
‚Ä≠  Was heretofore a fowl, but now imply
‚Ä≠  Thy husband‚Äôs being, and am come to give
‚Ä≠  The Wooers‚Äô death, that on my treasure live.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  With this sleep left me, and my waking way
‚Ä≠  I took, to try if any violent prey
‚Ä≠  Were made of those my fowls, which well enough
‚Ä≠  I, as before, found feeding at their trough
‚Ä≠  Their yoted wheat.‚Äù  ‚ÄúO woman,‚Äù  he replied,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThy dream can no interpretation bide
‚Ä≠  But what the eagle made, who was your lord,
‚Ä≠  And said himself would sure effect afford
‚Ä≠  To what he told you; that confusion
‚Ä≠  To all the Wooers should appear, and none
‚Ä≠  Escape the fate and death he had decreed.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She answer‚Äôd him:  ‚ÄúO guest, these dreams exceed
‚Ä≠  The art of man t‚Äô interpret; and appear
‚Ä≠  Without all choice or form; nor ever were
‚Ä≠  Perform‚Äôd to all at all parts.  But there are
‚Ä≠  To these light dreams, that like thin vapours fare,
‚Ä≠  Two two-leav‚Äôd gates, the one of ivory,
‚Ä≠  The other horn.  Those dreams, that fantasy
‚Ä≠  Takes from the polish‚Äôd ivory port, delude
‚Ä≠  The dreamer ever, and no truth include;
‚Ä≠  Those, that the glitt‚Äôring horn-gate lets abroad,
‚Ä≠  Do evermore some certain truth abode.
‚Ä≠  But this my dream I hold of no such sort
‚Ä≠  To fly from thence; yet, whichsoever port
‚Ä≠  It had access from, it did highly please
‚Ä≠  My son and me.  And this my thoughts profess:
‚Ä≠  That day that lights me from Ulysses‚Äô court
‚Ä≠  Shall both my infamy and curse consort.
‚Ä≠  I, therefore, purpose to propose them now,
‚Ä≠  In strong contention, Ulysses‚Äô bow;
‚Ä≠  Which he that eas‚Äôly draws, and from his draft
‚Ä≠  Shoots through twelve axes (as he did his shaft,
‚Ä≠  All set up in a row, and from them all
‚Ä≠  His stand-far-off kept firm) my fortunes shall
‚Ä≠  Dispose, and take me to his house from hence,
‚Ä≠  Where I was wed a maid, in confluence
‚Ä≠  Of feast and riches; such a court here then
‚Ä≠  As I shall ever in my dreams retain.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúDo not,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúdefer the gameful prize,
‚Ä≠  But set to task their importunities
‚Ä≠  With something else than nuptials; for your lord
‚Ä≠  Will to his court and kingdom be restor‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Before they thread those steels, or draw his bow.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO guest,‚Äù  replied Penelope,  ‚Äúwould you
‚Ä≠  Thus sit and please me with your speech, mine ears
‚Ä≠  Would never let mine eyelids close their spheres!
‚Ä≠  But none can live without the death of sleep,
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô Immortals in our mortal memories keep
‚Ä≠  Our ends and deaths by sleep, dividing so,
‚Ä≠  As by the fate and portion of our woe,
‚Ä≠  Our times spent here, to let us nightly try
‚Ä≠  That while we live, as much live as we die.
‚Ä≠  In which use I will to my bed ascend,
‚Ä≠  Which I bedew with tears, and sigh past end
‚Ä≠  Through all my hours spent, since I lost my joy
‚Ä≠  For vile, lewd, never-to-be-nam√©d, Troy,
‚Ä≠  Yet there I‚Äôll prove for sleep, which take you here,
‚Ä≠  Or on the earth, if that your custom were,
‚Ä≠  Or have a bed, dispos‚Äôd for warmer rest.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Thus left she with her ladies her old guest,
‚Ä≠  Ascended her fair chamber, and her bed,
‚Ä≠  Whose sight did ever duly make her shed
‚Ä≠  Tears for her lord; which still her eyes did steep,
‚Ä≠  Till Pallas shut them with delightsome sleep.

‚Ä≠  THE TWENTIETH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Ulysses, in the Wooers‚Äô beds,
‚Ä≠  Resolving first to kill the maids.
‚Ä≠  That sentence giving off, his care
‚Ä≠  For other objects doth prepare.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _œà._
‚Ä≠     Jove‚Äôs thunder chides,
‚Ä≠        But cheers the King,
‚Ä≠     The Wooers‚Äô prides
‚Ä≠        Discomfiting.

‚Ä≠  Ulysses in the entry laid his head,
‚Ä≠  And under him an ox-hide newly-flay‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Above him sheep-fells store; and over those
‚Ä≠  Eurynom√© cast mantles.  His repose
‚Ä≠  Would bring no sleep yet, studying the ill
‚Ä≠  He wish‚Äôd the Wooers; who came by him still
‚Ä≠  With all their wenches, laughing, wantoning,
‚Ä≠  In mutual lightness; which his heart did sting,
‚Ä≠  Contending two ways, if, all patience fled,
‚Ä≠  He should rush up and strike those strumpets dead,
‚Ä≠  Or let that night be last, and take th‚Äô extreme
‚Ä≠  Of those proud Wooers, that were so supreme
‚Ä≠  In pleasure of their high-fed fantasies.
‚Ä≠  His heart did bark within him to surprise
‚Ä≠  Their sports with spoils; no fell she-mastiff can,
‚Ä≠  Amongst her whelps, fly eag‚Äôrer on a man
‚Ä≠  She doth not know, yet scents him something near,
‚Ä≠  And fain would come to please her tooth, and tear,
‚Ä≠  Than his disdain, to see his roof so fil‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With those foul fashions, grew within him wild
‚Ä≠  To be in blood of them.  But, finding best
‚Ä≠  In his free judgment to let passion rest,
‚Ä≠  He chid his angry spirit, and beat his breast,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúForbear, my mind, and think on this:
‚Ä≠  There hath been time when bitter agonies
‚Ä≠  Have tried thy patience.  Call to mind the day
‚Ä≠  In which the Cyclop, which pass‚Äôd manly sway
‚Ä≠  Of violent strength, devour‚Äôd thy friends; thou then
‚Ä≠  Stood‚Äôst firmly bold, till from that hellish den
‚Ä≠  Thy wisdom brought thee off, when nought but death
‚Ä≠  Thy thoughts resolv‚Äôd on.‚Äù  This discourse did breathe
‚Ä≠  The fiery boundings of his heart, that still
‚Ä≠  Lay in that √¶sture, without end his ill
‚Ä≠  Yet manly suff‚Äôring.  But from side to side
‚Ä≠  It made him toss apace.  You have not tried
‚Ä≠  A fellow roasting of a pig before
‚Ä≠  A hasty fire, his belly yielding store
‚Ä≠  Of fat and blood, turn faster, labour more
‚Ä≠  To have it roast, and would not have it burn,
‚Ä≠  Than this and that way his unrest made turn
‚Ä≠  His thoughts and body, would not quench the fire,
‚Ä≠  And yet not have it heighten his desire
‚Ä≠  Past his discretion, and the fit enough
‚Ä≠  Of haste and speed, that went to all the proof
‚Ä≠  His well-laid plots, and his exploits requir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Since he, but one, to all their deaths aspir‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     In this contention Pallas stoop‚Äôd from heav‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  Stood over him, and had her presence giv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  A woman‚Äôs form, who sternly thus began:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúWhy, thou most sour and wretched-fated man
‚Ä≠  Of all that breathe, yet liest thou thus awake?
‚Ä≠  The house in which thy cares so toss and take
‚Ä≠  Thy quiet up is thine; thy wife is there;
‚Ä≠  And such a son, as if thy wishes were
‚Ä≠  To be suffic‚Äôd with one they could not mend.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúGoddess,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äú‚Äôtis true; but I contend
‚Ä≠  To right their wrongs, and, though I be but one,
‚Ä≠  To lay unhelp‚Äôd and wreakful hand upon
‚Ä≠  This whole resort of impudents, that here
‚Ä≠  Their rude assemblies never will forbear.
‚Ä≠  And yet a greater doubt employs my care,
‚Ä≠  That if their slaughters in my reaches are,
‚Ä≠  And I perform them, Jove and you not pleas‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  How shall I fly their friends? And would stand seis‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of counsel to resolve this care in me.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúWretch,‚Äù  she replied,  ‚Äúa friend of worse degree
‚Ä≠  Might win thy credence, that a mortal were, I
‚Ä≠  And us‚Äôd to second thee, though nothing near
‚Ä≠  So pow‚Äôrful in performance nor in care;
‚Ä≠  Yet I, a Goddess, that have still had share
‚Ä≠  In thy achievements, and thy person‚Äôs guard,
‚Ä≠  Must still be doubted by thy brain, so hard
‚Ä≠  To credit anything above thy pow‚Äôr;
‚Ä≠  And that must come from heav‚Äôn; if ev‚Äôry hour
‚Ä≠  There be not personal appearance made,
‚Ä≠  And aid direct giv‚Äôn, that may sense invade.
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll tell thee, therefore, clearly:  If there were
‚Ä≠  Of divers-languag‚Äôd men an army here
‚Ä≠  Of fifty companies, all driving hence
‚Ä≠  Thy sheep and oxen, and with violence
‚Ä≠  Offer‚Äôd to charge us, and besiege us round,
‚Ä≠  Thou shouldst their prey reprise, and them confound.
‚Ä≠  Let sleep then seize thee.  _To keep watch all night
‚Ä≠  Consumes the spirits, and makes dull the sight.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠  Thus pour‚Äôd the Goddess sleep into his eyes,
‚Ä≠  And reascended the Olympian skies.
‚Ä≠     When care-and-lineament-resolving sleep
‚Ä≠  Had laid his temples in his golden steep,
‚Ä≠  His-wise-in-chaste-wit-worthy wife did rise,
‚Ä≠  First sitting up in her soft bed, her eyes
‚Ä≠  Open‚Äôd with tears, in care of her estate,
‚Ä≠  Which now her friends resolv‚Äôd to terminate
‚Ä≠  To more delays, and make her marry one.
‚Ä≠  Her silent tears then ceas‚Äôd, her orison
‚Ä≠  This Queen of women to Diana made:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúRev‚Äôrend Diana, let thy darts invade
‚Ä≠  My woeful bosom, and my life deprive,
‚Ä≠  Now at this instant, or soon after drive
‚Ä≠  My soul with tempests forth, and give it way
‚Ä≠  To those far-off dark vaults, where never day
‚Ä≠  Hath pow‚Äôr to shine, and let them cast it down
‚Ä≠  Where refluent Oceanus doth crown
‚Ä≠  His curl√©d head, where Pluto‚Äôs orchard is,
‚Ä≠  And entrance to our after miseries.
‚Ä≠  As such stern whirlwinds ravish‚Äôd to that stream
‚Ä≠  Pandareus‚Äô daughters, when the Gods to them
‚Ä≠  Had reft their parents, and them left alone,
‚Ä≠  Poor orphan children, in their mansion;
‚Ä≠  Whose desolate life did Love‚Äôs sweet Queen incline
‚Ä≠  To nurse with press√©d milk and sweetest wine;
‚Ä≠  Whom Juno deck‚Äôd beyond all other dames
‚Ä≠  With wisdom‚Äôs light, and beauty‚Äôs moving flames;
‚Ä≠  Whom Ph≈ìbe goodliness of stature render‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  And to whose fair hands wise Minerva tender‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The loom and needle in their utmost skill;
‚Ä≠  And while Love‚Äôs Empress scal‚Äôd th‚Äô Olympian hill
‚Ä≠  To beg of lightning-loving Jove (since he
‚Ä≠  The means to all things knows, and doth decree
‚Ä≠  Fortunes, infortunes, to the mortal race)
‚Ä≠  For those poor virgins, the accomplish‚Äôd grace
‚Ä≠  Of sweetest nuptials, the fierce Harpies prey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  On ev‚Äôry good and miserable maid,
‚Ä≠  And to the hateful Furies gave them all
‚Ä≠  In horrid service; yet, may such fate fall
‚Ä≠  From steep Olympus on my loath√©d head,
‚Ä≠  Or fair-chair‚Äôd Ph≈ìbe strike me instant dead,
‚Ä≠  That I may undergo the gloomy shore
‚Ä≠  To visit great Ulysses‚Äô soul, before
‚Ä≠  I soothe my idle blood and wed a worse.
‚Ä≠  And yet, beneath how desperate a curse
‚Ä≠  Do I live now!  It is an ill that may
‚Ä≠  Be well endur‚Äôd, to mourn the whole long day,
‚Ä≠  So night‚Äôs sweet sleeps, that make a man forget
‚Ä≠  Both bad and good, in some degree would let
‚Ä≠  My thoughts leave grieving; but, both day and night,
‚Ä≠  Some cruel God gives my sad memory sight.
‚Ä≠  This night, methought, Ulysses grac‚Äôd my bed
‚Ä≠  In all the goodly state with which he led
‚Ä≠  The Grecian army; which gave joys extreme
‚Ä≠  To my distress, esteeming it no dream,
‚Ä≠  But true indeed; and that conceit I had,
‚Ä≠  That when I saw it false I might be mad.
‚Ä≠  Such cruel fates command in my life‚Äôs guide.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     By this the morning‚Äôs orient dews had dyed
‚Ä≠  The earth in all her colours; when the King,
‚Ä≠  In his sweet sleep, suppos‚Äôd the sorrowing
‚Ä≠  That she us‚Äôd waking in her plaintive bed
‚Ä≠  To be her mourning, standing by his head,
‚Ä≠  As having known him there; who straight arose,
‚Ä≠  And did again within the hall dispose
‚Ä≠  The carpets and the cushions, where before
‚Ä≠  They serv‚Äôd the seats.  The hide without the door
‚Ä≠  He carried back, and then, with held-up hands,
‚Ä≠  He pray‚Äôd to Him that heav‚Äôn and earth commands:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO Father Jove, if through the moist and dry
‚Ä≠  You, willing, brought me home, when misery
‚Ä≠  Had punish‚Äôd me enough by your free dooms,
‚Ä≠  Let some of these within those inner rooms,
‚Ä≠  Startled with horror of some strange ostent,
‚Ä≠  Come here, and tell me that great Jove hath bent
‚Ä≠  Threat‚Äônings without at some lewd men within.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     To this his pray‚Äôr Jove shook his sable chin,
‚Ä≠  And thunder‚Äôd from those pure clouds that, above
‚Ä≠  The breathing air, in bright Olympus move.
‚Ä≠  Divine Ulysses joy‚Äôd to hear it roar.
‚Ä≠  Report of which a woman-miller bore
‚Ä≠  Straight to his ears; for near to him there ground
‚Ä≠  Mills for his corn, that twice six women found
‚Ä≠  Continual motion, grinding barley-meal,
‚Ä≠  And wheat, man‚Äôs marrow.  Sleep the eyes did seal
‚Ä≠  Of all the other women, having done
‚Ä≠  Their usual task; which yet this dame alone
‚Ä≠  Had scarce giv‚Äôn end to, being, of all the rest,
‚Ä≠  Least fit for labour.  But when these sounds prest
‚Ä≠  Her ears, above the rumbling of her mill,
‚Ä≠  She let that stand, look‚Äôd out, and heav‚Äôn‚Äôs steep hill
‚Ä≠  Saw clear and temp‚Äôrate; which made her (unware
‚Ä≠  Of giving any comfort to his care
‚Ä≠  In that strange sign he pray‚Äôd for) thus, invoke:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO King of men and Gods, a mighty stroke
‚Ä≠  Thy thund‚Äôring hand laid on the cope of stars,
‚Ä≠  No cloud in all the air; and therefore wars
‚Ä≠  Thou bidst to some men in thy sure ostent!
‚Ä≠  Perform to me, poor wretch, the main event,
‚Ä≠  And make this day the last, and most extreme,
‚Ä≠  In which the Wooers‚Äô pride shall solace them
‚Ä≠  With whorish banquets in Ulysses‚Äô roof,
‚Ä≠  That, with sad toil to grind them meal enough,
‚Ä≠  Have quite dissolv‚Äôd my knees.  Vouchsafe, then, now
‚Ä≠  Thy thunders may their latest feast foreshow.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This was the boon Ulysses begg‚Äôd of Jove,  [1]
‚Ä≠  Which, with his thunder, through his bosom drove
‚Ä≠  A joy, that this vaunt breath‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúWhy now these men,
‚Ä≠  Despite their pride, will Jove make pay me pain.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     By this had other maids, than those that lay
‚Ä≠  Mix‚Äôd with the Wooers, made a fire like day
‚Ä≠  Amidst the hearth of the illustrious hall;
‚Ä≠  And then the Prince, like a Celestial,
‚Ä≠  Rose from his bed, to his embalm‚Äôd feet tied
‚Ä≠  Fair shoes, his sword about his breast applied,
‚Ä≠  Took to his hand his sharp-pil‚Äôd lance, and met,
‚Ä≠  Amidst the entry, his old nurse, that set
‚Ä≠  His haste at sudden stand; to whom he said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO, my lov‚Äôd nurse, with what grace have you laid
‚Ä≠  And fed my guest here?  Could you so neglect
‚Ä≠  His age, to lodge him thus?  Though all respect
‚Ä≠  I give my mother‚Äôs wisdom, I must yet
‚Ä≠  Affirm it fail‚Äôd in this; for she hath set
‚Ä≠  At much more price a man of much less worth,
‚Ä≠  Without his person‚Äôs note, and yet casts forth
‚Ä≠  With ignominious hands, for his form sake,
‚Ä≠  A man much better.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDo not faulty make,
‚Ä≠  Good son, the faultless.  He was giv‚Äôn his seat
‚Ä≠  Close to her side, and food till he would eat,
‚Ä≠  Wine till his wish was serv‚Äôd; for she requir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His wants, and will‚Äôd him all things he desir‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  Commanded her chief maids to make his bed,
‚Ä≠  But he, as one whom sorrow only fed
‚Ä≠  And all infortune, would not take his rest
‚Ä≠  In bed, and cov‚Äôrings fit for any guest,
‚Ä≠  But in the entry, on an ox‚Äôs hide
‚Ä≠  Never at tanner‚Äôs, his old limbs implied,
‚Ä≠  In warm sheep-fells; yet over all we cast
‚Ä≠  A mantle, fitting for a man more grac‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He took her answer, left the house, and went,
‚Ä≠  Attended with his dogs, to sift th‚Äô event
‚Ä≠  Of private plots, betwixt him and his sire
‚Ä≠  In common counsel.  Then the crew entire
‚Ä≠  Of all the household maids Euryclea bad
‚Ä≠  Bestir them through the house, and see it clad
‚Ä≠  In all best form; gave all their parts; and one
‚Ä≠  She set to furnish ev‚Äôry seat and throne
‚Ä≠  With needle works, and purple clothes of state;
‚Ä≠  Another set to scour and cleanse the plate;
‚Ä≠  Another all the tables to make proud
‚Ä≠  With porous sponges; others she bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In all speed to the spring, to fetch from thence
‚Ä≠  Fit store of water; all at all expence
‚Ä≠  Of pains she will‚Äôd to be; for this to all
‚Ä≠  Should be a day of common festival,
‚Ä≠  And not a Wooer now should seek his home,
‚Ä≠  Elsewhere than there, but all were bid to come
‚Ä≠  Exceeding early, and be rais‚Äôd to heav‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  With all the entertainment could be giv‚Äôn.
‚Ä≠     They heard with greedy ears, and ev‚Äôrything
‚Ä≠  Put straight in practice.  Twenty to the spring
‚Ä≠  Made speed for water; many in the house
‚Ä≠  Took pains; and all were both laborious
‚Ä≠  And skill‚Äôd in labour; many fell to fell
‚Ä≠  And cleave their wood; and all did more than well.
‚Ä≠     Then troop‚Äôd the lusty Wooers in; and then
‚Ä≠  Came all from spring; at their heels loaded men
‚Ä≠  With slaughter‚Äôd brawns, of all the herd the prize,
‚Ä≠  That had been long fed-up in sev‚Äôral styes;
‚Ä≠  Eum√¶us and his men convey‚Äôd them there,
‚Ä≠  He, seeing now the king, began to cheer,
‚Ä≠  And thus saluted him:  ‚ÄúHow now, my guest?
‚Ä≠  Have yet your virtues found more interest
‚Ä≠  In these great Wooers‚Äô good respects?  Or still
‚Ä≠  Pursue they you with all their wonted ill?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI would to heav‚Äôn, Eum√¶us,‚Äù  he replied,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThe Deities once would take in hand their pride,
‚Ä≠  That such unseemly fashions put in frame
‚Ä≠  In others‚Äô roofs, as show no spark of shame.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus these; and to these came Melanthius,
‚Ä≠  Great guardian of the most egregious
‚Ä≠  Rich Wooers‚Äô herds, consisting all of goats;
‚Ä≠  Which he, with two more, drave, and made their cotes
‚Ä≠  The sounding porticos of that fair court.
‚Ä≠  Melanthius, seeing the king, this former sort
‚Ä≠  Of upland language gave:  ‚ÄúWhat?  Still stay here,
‚Ä≠  And dull these Wooers with thy wretched cheer?
‚Ä≠  Not gone for ever yet?  Why now I see
‚Ä≠  This strife of cuffs betwixt the beggary,
‚Ä≠  That yesterday assay‚Äôd to get thee gone,
‚Ä≠  And thy more roguery, needs will fall upon
‚Ä≠  My hands to arbitrate.  Thou wilt not hence
‚Ä≠  Till I set on thee; thy ragg‚Äôd impudence
‚Ä≠  Is so fast-footed.  Are there not beside
‚Ä≠  Other great banquetants, but you must tide
‚Ä≠  At anchor still with us?‚Äù  He nothing said,
‚Ä≠  But thought of ill enough, and shook his head.
‚Ä≠     Then came Phil≈ìtius, a chief of men,
‚Ä≠  That to the Wooers‚Äô all-devouring den
‚Ä≠  A barren steer drave, and fat goats; for they
‚Ä≠  In custom were with traffickers by sea,
‚Ä≠  That who they would sent, and had utt‚Äôrance there.
‚Ä≠  And for these likewise the fair porches were
‚Ä≠  Hurdles and sheep-pens, as in any fair.
‚Ä≠  Phil≈ìtius took note in his repair
‚Ä≠  Of seen Ulysses, being a man as well
‚Ä≠  Giv‚Äôn to his mind‚Äôs use as to buy and sell,
‚Ä≠  Or do the drudg‚Äôry that the blood desir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And, standing near Eum√¶us, this enquir‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúWhat guest is this that makes our house of late
‚Ä≠  His entertainer?  Whence claims he the state
‚Ä≠  His birth in this life holds?  What nation?
‚Ä≠  What race?  What country stands his speech upon?
‚Ä≠  O‚Äôer hardly portion‚Äôd by the terrible Fates.
‚Ä≠  The structure of his lineaments relates
‚Ä≠  A king‚Äôs resemblance in his pomp of reign
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn thus in these rags.  But poor erring men,
‚Ä≠  That have no firm home, but range here and there
‚Ä≠  As need compels, God keeps in this earth‚Äôs sphere,
‚Ä≠  As under water, and this tune he sings,
‚Ä≠  When he is spinning ev‚Äôn the cares of kings.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus coming to him, with a kind of fear
‚Ä≠  He took his hand, and, touch‚Äôd exceeding near
‚Ä≠  With mere imagination of his worth,
‚Ä≠  This salutation he sent loudly forth:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHealth!  Father stranger!  In another world
‚Ä≠  Be rich and happy, though thou here art hurl‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  At feet of never such insulting Need.
‚Ä≠  O Jove, there lives no one God of thy seed
‚Ä≠  More ill to man than thou.  Thou tak‚Äôst no ruth--
‚Ä≠  When thou thyself hast got him in most truth--
‚Ä≠  To wrap him in the straits of most distress,
‚Ä≠  And in the curse of others‚Äô wickedness.
‚Ä≠  My brows have swet to see it, and mine eyes
‚Ä≠  Broke all in tears, when this being still the guise
‚Ä≠  Of worthiest men, I have but only thought,
‚Ä≠  That down to these ills was Ulysses wrought,
‚Ä≠  And that, thus clad, ev‚Äôn he is error-driv‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  If yet he live and sees the light of heav‚Äôn.
‚Ä≠  But, if now dead, and in the house of hell,
‚Ä≠  O me!  O good Ulysses!  That my weal
‚Ä≠  Did ever wish, and when, but half a man
‚Ä≠  Amongst the people Cephallenian,
‚Ä≠  His bounty to his oxen‚Äôs charge preferr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  One in that youth; which now is grown a herd
‚Ä≠  Unspeakable for number, and feed there
‚Ä≠  With their broad heads, as thick as of his ear
‚Ä≠  A field of corn is to a man.  Yet these
‚Ä≠  Some men advise me with this noted prease
‚Ä≠  Of Wooers may devour, and wish me drive
‚Ä≠  Up to their feasts with them, that neither give
‚Ä≠  His son respect, though in his own free roof,
‚Ä≠  Nor have the wit to fear th‚Äô infallible proof
‚Ä≠  Of Heav‚Äônly vengeance, but make offer now
‚Ä≠  The long-lack‚Äôd King‚Äôs possessions to bestow
‚Ä≠  In their self-shares.  Methinks the mind in me
‚Ä≠  Doth turn as fast, as in a flood or sea
‚Ä≠  A raging whirlpit doth, to gather in
‚Ä≠  To fishy death those swimmers in their sin;
‚Ä≠  Or feeds a motion as circular
‚Ä≠  To drive my herds away.  But while the son
‚Ä≠  Bears up with life, ‚Äôtwere heinous wrong to run
‚Ä≠  To other people with them, and to trust
‚Ä≠  Men of another earth.  And yet more just
‚Ä≠  It were to venture their laws, the main right
‚Ä≠  Made still their masters, than at home lose quite
‚Ä≠  Their right and them, and sit and grieve to see
‚Ä≠  The wrong authoriz‚Äôd by their gluttony.
‚Ä≠  And I had long since fled, and tried th‚Äô event
‚Ä≠  With other proud kings, since more insolent
‚Ä≠  These are than can be borne, but that ev‚Äôn still
‚Ä≠  I had a hope that this, though born to ill,
‚Ä≠  Would one day come from some coast, and their last
‚Ä≠  In his roofs strew with ruins red and vast.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHerdsman,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúbecause thou art in show
‚Ä≠  Nor lewd nor indiscreet, and that I know
‚Ä≠  There rules in thee an understanding soul,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll take an oath, that in thee shall control
‚Ä≠  All doubt of what I swear:  Be witness, Jove,
‚Ä≠  That sway‚Äôst the first seat of the thron‚Äôd above,
‚Ä≠  This hospitable table, and this house,
‚Ä≠  That still hold title for the strenuous
‚Ä≠  Son of Laertes, that, if so you please,
‚Ä≠  Your eyes shall witness Laertiades
‚Ä≠  Arriv‚Äôd at home, and all these men that reign
‚Ä≠  In such excesses here shall here lie slain!‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúStranger!  Would just Jove would sign
‚Ä≠  What you have sworn!  In your eyes‚Äô beams should shine
‚Ä≠  What pow‚Äôrs I manage, and how these my hands
‚Ä≠  Would rise and follow where he first commands.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     So said Eum√¶us, praying all the Sky
‚Ä≠  That wise Ulysses might arrive and try.
‚Ä≠     Thus while they vow‚Äôd, the Wooers sat as hard
‚Ä≠  On his son‚Äôs death, but had their counsels scar‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  For on their left hand did an eagle soar,
‚Ä≠  And in her seres a fearful pigeon bore.
‚Ä≠  Which seen, Amphinomus presag‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúO friends,
‚Ä≠  Our counsels never will receive their ends
‚Ä≠  In this man‚Äôs slaughter.  Let us therefore ply
‚Ä≠  Our bloody feast, and make his oxen die.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus came they in, cast off on seats their cloaks,
‚Ä≠  And fell to giving sacrificing strokes
‚Ä≠  Of sheep and goats, the chiefly fat and great,
‚Ä≠  Slew fed-up swine, and from the herd a neat.
‚Ä≠    The inwards roasted they dispos‚Äôd bewixt
‚Ä≠  Their then observers, wine in flagons mixt.
‚Ä≠     The bowls Eum√¶us brought, Phil≈ìtius bread,
‚Ä≠  Melanthius fill‚Äôd the wine.  Thus drank and fed
‚Ä≠  The feastful Wooers.  Then the prince, in grace
‚Ä≠  Of his close project, did his father place
‚Ä≠  Amidst the pav√©d entry, in a seat
‚Ä≠  Seemless and abject, a small board and meat
‚Ä≠  Of th‚Äô only inwards; in a cup of gold
‚Ä≠  Yet sent him wine, and bade him now drink bold,
‚Ä≠  All his approaches he himself would free
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôGainst all the Wooers, since he would not see
‚Ä≠  His court made popular, but that his sire
‚Ä≠  Built it to his use.  Therefore all the fire
‚Ä≠  Blown in the Wooers‚Äô spleens he bade suppress,
‚Ä≠  And that in hands nor words they should digress
‚Ä≠  From that set peace his speech did then proclaim.
‚Ä≠  They bit their lips and wonder‚Äôd at his aim
‚Ä≠  In that brave language; when Antinous said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThough this speech, Grecians, be a mere upbraid,
‚Ä≠  Yet this time give it pass.  The will of Jove
‚Ä≠  Forbids the violence of our hands to move,
‚Ä≠  But of our tongues we keep the motion free,
‚Ä≠  And, therefore, if his further jollity
‚Ä≠  Tempt our encounter with his braves, let‚Äôs check
‚Ä≠  His growing insolence, though pride to speak
‚Ä≠  Fly passing high with him.‚Äù  The wise prince made
‚Ä≠  No more spring of his speech, but let it fade.
‚Ä≠     And now the heralds bore about the town
‚Ä≠  The sacred hecatomb; to whose renown
‚Ä≠  The fair-hair‚Äôd Greeks assembled, and beneath
‚Ä≠  Apollo‚Äôs shady wood the holy death
‚Ä≠  They put to fire; which, made enough, they drew,
‚Ä≠  Divided all, that did in th‚Äô end accrue
‚Ä≠  To glorious satisfaction.  Those that were
‚Ä≠  Disposers of the feast did equal cheer
‚Ä≠  Bestow on wretched Laertiades,
‚Ä≠  With all the Wooers‚Äô souls; it so did please
‚Ä≠  Telemachus to charge them.  And for these
‚Ä≠  Minerva would not see the malices
‚Ä≠  The Wooers bore too much contain‚Äôd, that so
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô mov‚Äôd heart yet might higher flow
‚Ä≠  In wreakful anguish.  There was wooing there,
‚Ä≠  Amongst the rest, a gallant that did bear
‚Ä≠  The name of one well-learn‚Äôd in jests profane,
‚Ä≠  His name Ctesippus, born a Samian;
‚Ä≠  Who, proud because his father was so rich,
‚Ä≠  Had so much confidence as did bewitch
‚Ä≠  His heart with hope to wed Ulysses‚Äô wife;
‚Ä≠  And this man said:  ‚ÄúHear me, my lords, in strife
‚Ä≠  For this great widow.  This her guest did share
‚Ä≠  Even feast with us, with very comely care
‚Ä≠  Of him that order‚Äôd it; for ‚Äôtis not good
‚Ä≠  Nor equal to deprive guests of their food,
‚Ä≠  And specially whatever guest makes way
‚Ä≠  To that house where Telemachus doth sway;
‚Ä≠  And therefore I will add to his receit
‚Ä≠  A gift of very hospitable weight,
‚Ä≠  Which he may give again to any maid
‚Ä≠  That bathes his grave feet, and her pains see paid,
‚Ä≠  Or any servant else that the divine
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô lofty battlements confine.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus snatch‚Äôd he with a valiant hand, from out
‚Ä≠  The poor folks‚Äô common basket, a neat‚Äôs foot,
‚Ä≠  And threw it at Ulysses; who his head
‚Ä≠  Shrunk quietly aside, and let it shed
‚Ä≠  His malice on the wall; the suff‚Äôring man
‚Ä≠  A laughter raising most Sardinian,
‚Ä≠  With scorn and wrath mix‚Äôd, at the Samian.
‚Ä≠  Whom thus the prince reprov‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúYour valour wan
‚Ä≠  Much grace, Ctesippus, and hath eas‚Äôd your mind
‚Ä≠  With mighty profit, yet you see it find
‚Ä≠  No mark it aim‚Äôd at; the poor stranger‚Äôs part
‚Ä≠  Himself made good enough, to ‚Äôscape your dart.
‚Ä≠  But should I serve thee worthily, my lance
‚Ä≠  Should strike thy heart through, and, in place t‚Äô advance
‚Ä≠  Thyself in nuptials with his wealth, thy sire
‚Ä≠  Should make thy tomb here; that the foolish fire
‚Ä≠  Of all such valours may not dare to show
‚Ä≠  These foul indecencies to me.  I now
‚Ä≠  Have years to understand my strength, and know
‚Ä≠  The good and bad of things, and am no more
‚Ä≠  At your large suff‚Äôrance, to behold my store
‚Ä≠  Consum‚Äôd with patience, see my cattle slain,
‚Ä≠  My wine exhausted, and my bread in vain
‚Ä≠  Spent on your license; for to one then young
‚Ä≠  So many enemies were match too strong.
‚Ä≠  But let me never more be witness to
‚Ä≠  Your hostile minds, nor those base deeds ye do;
‚Ä≠  For, should ye kill me in my offer‚Äôd wreak,
‚Ä≠  I wish it rather, and my death would speak
‚Ä≠  Much more good of me, than to live and see
‚Ä≠  Indignity upon indignity,
‚Ä≠  My guests provok‚Äôd with bitter words and blows,
‚Ä≠  My women-servants dragg‚Äôd about my house
‚Ä≠  To lust and rapture.‚Äù  This made silence seize
‚Ä≠  The house throughout; till Damastorides
‚Ä≠  At length the calm brake, and said:  ‚ÄúFriend, forbear
‚Ä≠  To give a just speech a disdainful ear;
‚Ä≠  The guest no more touch, nor no servant here.
‚Ä≠  Myself will to the Prince and Queen commend
‚Ä≠  A motion grateful, if they please to lend
‚Ä≠  Grateful receipt.  As long as any hope
‚Ä≠  Left wise Ulysses any passage ope
‚Ä≠  To his return in our conceits, so long
‚Ä≠  The Queen‚Äôs delays to our demands stood strong
‚Ä≠  In cause and reason, and our quarrels thus
‚Ä≠  With guests, the Queen, or her Telemachus,
‚Ä≠  Set never foot amongst our lib‚Äôral feast;
‚Ä≠  For should the King return, though thought deceas‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  It had been gain to us, in finding him,
‚Ä≠  To lose his wife.  But now, since nothing dim
‚Ä≠  The days break out that show he never more
‚Ä≠  Shall reach the dear touch of his country-shore,
‚Ä≠  Sit by your mother, in persuasion
‚Ä≠  That now it stands her honour much upon
‚Ä≠  To choose the best of us, and, who gives most,
‚Ä≠  To go with him home.  For so, all things lost
‚Ä≠  In sticking on our haunt so, you shall clear
‚Ä≠  Recover in our no more concourse here,
‚Ä≠  Possess your birth-right wholly, eat and drink,
‚Ä≠  And never more on our disgraces think.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúBy Jove, no, Agelaus!  For I swear
‚Ä≠  By all my father‚Äôs sorrows, who doth err
‚Ä≠  Far off from Ithaca, or rests in death,
‚Ä≠  I am so far from spending but my breath
‚Ä≠  To make my mother any more defer
‚Ä≠  Her wish√©d nuptials, that I‚Äôll counsel her
‚Ä≠  To make her free choice; and besides will give
‚Ä≠  Large gifts to move her.  But I fear to drive
‚Ä≠  Or charge her hence; for God will not give way
‚Ä≠  To any such course, if I should assay.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     At this, Minerva made for foolish joy
‚Ä≠  The Wooers mad, and rous‚Äôd their late annoy
‚Ä≠  To such a laughter as would never down.
‚Ä≠  They laugh‚Äôd with others‚Äô cheeks, ate meat o‚Äôerflown
‚Ä≠  With their own bloods, their eyes stood full of tears
‚Ä≠  For violent joys; their souls yet thought of fears,
‚Ä≠  Which Theoclymenus express‚Äôd, and said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO wretches!  Why sustain ye, well apaid,
‚Ä≠  Your imminent ill?  A night, with which death sees,
‚Ä≠  Your heads and faces hides beneath your knees;
‚Ä≠  Shrieks burn about you; your eyes thrust out tears;
‚Ä≠  These fix√©d walls, and that main beam that bears
‚Ä≠  The whole house up, in bloody torrents fall;
‚Ä≠  The entry full of ghosts stands; full the hall
‚Ä≠  Of passengers to hell; and under all
‚Ä≠  The dismal shades; the sun sinks from the poles;
‚Ä≠  And troubled air pours bane about your souls.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     They sweetly laughed at this.  Eurymachus
‚Ä≠  To mocks dispos‚Äôd, and said:  ‚ÄúThis new-come-t‚Äô-us
‚Ä≠  Is surely mad, conduct him forth to light
‚Ä≠  In th‚Äô open market-place; he thinks ‚Äôtis night
‚Ä≠  Within the house.‚Äù  ‚ÄúEurymachus,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúI will not ask for any guide of thee,
‚Ä≠  I both my feet enjoy, have ears and eyes,
‚Ä≠  And no mad soul within me; and with these
‚Ä≠  Will I go forth the doors, because I know
‚Ä≠  That imminent mischief must abide with you,
‚Ä≠  Which not a man of all the Wooers here
‚Ä≠  Shall fly or ‚Äôscape.  Ye all too highly bear
‚Ä≠  Your uncurb‚Äôd heads.  Impieties ye commit,
‚Ä≠  And ev‚Äôry man affect with forms unfit.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said, he left the house, and took his way
‚Ä≠  Home to Pir√¶us; who, as free as day,
‚Ä≠  Was of his welcome.  When the Wooers‚Äô eyes
‚Ä≠  Chang‚Äôd looks with one another, and, their guise
‚Ä≠  Of laughters still held on, still eas‚Äôd their breasts
‚Ä≠  Of will to set the Prince against his guests,
‚Ä≠  Affirming that of all the men alive
‚Ä≠  He worst luck had, and prov‚Äôd it worst to give
‚Ä≠  Guests entertainment; for he had one there
‚Ä≠  A wand‚Äôring hunter-out of provender,
‚Ä≠  An errant beggar ev‚Äôry way, yet thought
‚Ä≠  (He was so hungry) that he needed nought
‚Ä≠  But wine and victuals, nor knew how to do,
‚Ä≠  Nor had a spirit to put a knowledge to,
‚Ä≠  But liv‚Äôd an idle burthen to the earth.
‚Ä≠     Another then stepp‚Äôd up, and would lay forth
‚Ä≠  His lips in prophecy, thus:  ‚ÄúBut, would he hear
‚Ä≠  His friends‚Äô persuasions, he should find it were
‚Ä≠  More profit for him to put both aboard
‚Ä≠  For the Sicilian people, that afford
‚Ä≠  These feet of men good price; and this would bring  [2]
‚Ä≠  Good means for better guests.‚Äù  These, words made wing
‚Ä≠  To his ears idly, who had still his eye
‚Ä≠  Upon his father, looking fervently
‚Ä≠  When he would lay his long-withholding hand
‚Ä≠  On those proud Wooers.  And, within command
‚Ä≠  Of all this speech that pass‚Äôd, Icarius‚Äô heir,
‚Ä≠  The wise Penelope, her royal chair
‚Ä≠  Had plac‚Äôd of purpose.  Their high dinner then
‚Ä≠  With all-pleas‚Äôd palates these ridiculous men
‚Ä≠  Fell sweetly to, as joying they had slain
‚Ä≠  Such store of banquet.  But there did not reign
‚Ä≠  A bitterer banquet-planet in all heav‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  Than that which Pallas had to that day driv‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  And, with her able friend now, meant t‚Äô appose,
‚Ä≠  Since they till then were in deserts so gross.

‚Ä≠  THE TWENTY-FIRST BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Penelope proposeth now
‚Ä≠  To him that draws Ulysses‚Äô bow
‚Ä≠  Her instant nuptials.  Ithacus
‚Ä≠  Eum√¶us and Phil≈ìtius
‚Ä≠  Gives charge for guarding of the gates;
‚Ä≠  And he his shaft shoots through the plates.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _Œ¶ŒπÃë._
‚Ä≠     The nuptial vow
‚Ä≠        And game rehears‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠     Drawn is the bow,
‚Ä≠        The steels are pierc‚Äôd.

‚Ä≠  Pallus, the Goddess with the sparkling eyes,
‚Ä≠  Excites Penelope t‚Äô object the prize,
‚Ä≠  The bow and bright steels, to the Wooers‚Äô strength
‚Ä≠  And here began the strife and blood at length.
‚Ä≠  She first ascended by a lofty stair
‚Ä≠  Her utmost chamber; of whose door her fair
‚Ä≠  And half transparent hand receiv‚Äôd the key,
‚Ä≠  Bright, brazen, bitted passing curiously,
‚Ä≠  And at it hung a knob of ivory.
‚Ä≠  And this did lead her where was strongly kept
‚Ä≠  The treasure-royal; in whose store lay heapt
‚Ä≠  Gold, brass, and steel, engrav‚Äôn with infinite art;
‚Ä≠  The crooked bow, and arrowy quiver, part
‚Ä≠  Of that rich magazine.  In the quiver were
‚Ä≠  Arrows a number, sharp and sighing gear.
‚Ä≠  The bow was giv‚Äôn by kind Eurytides
‚Ä≠  Iphitus, fashion‚Äôd like the Deities,
‚Ä≠  To young Ulysses, when within the roof
‚Ä≠  Of wise Orsilochus their pass had proof
‚Ä≠  Of mutual meeting in Messena; where
‚Ä≠  Ulysses claim‚Äôd a debt, to whose pay were
‚Ä≠  The whole Messenian people bound, since they
‚Ä≠  From Ithaca had forc‚Äôd a wealthy prey
‚Ä≠  Of sheep and shepherds.  In their ships they thrust
‚Ä≠  Three hundred sheep together; for whose just
‚Ä≠  And instant rendry old Laertes sent
‚Ä≠  Ulysses his ambassador, that went
‚Ä≠  A long way in the ambassy, yet then
‚Ä≠  Bore but the foremost prime of youngest men;
‚Ä≠  His father sending first to that affair
‚Ä≠  His gravest counsellors, and then his heir.
‚Ä≠  Iphitus made his way there, having lost
‚Ä≠  Twelve female horse, and mules commended most
‚Ä≠  For use of burthen; which were after cause
‚Ä≠  Of death and fate to him; for, past all laws
‚Ä≠  Of hospitality, Jove‚Äôs mighty son,
‚Ä≠  Skill‚Äôd in great acts, was his confusion
‚Ä≠  Close by his house, though at that time his guest,
‚Ä≠  Respecting neither the appos√©d feast,
‚Ä≠  And hospitable table, that in love
‚Ä≠  He set before him, nor the voice of Jove,
‚Ä≠  But, seizing first his mares, he after slew
‚Ä≠  His host himself.  From those mares‚Äô search now grew
‚Ä≠  Ulysses known t‚Äô Iphitus; who that bow
‚Ä≠  At their encounter did in love bestow,
‚Ä≠  Which great Eurytus‚Äô hand had borne before,
‚Ä≠  (Iphitus‚Äô father) who, at death‚Äôs sad door,
‚Ä≠  In his steep turrets, left it to his son.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses gave him a keen falchion,
‚Ä≠  And mighty lance.  And thus began they there
‚Ä≠  Their fatal loves; for after never were
‚Ä≠  Their mutual tables to each other known,
‚Ä≠  Because Jove‚Äôs son th‚Äô unworthy part had shown
‚Ä≠  Of slaughtering this God-like loving man,
‚Ä≠  Eurytus‚Äô son, who with that bow began
‚Ä≠  And ended love t‚Äô Ulysses; who so dear
‚Ä≠  A gift esteem‚Äôd it, that he would not bear
‚Ä≠  In his black fleet that guest-rite to the war,
‚Ä≠  But, in fit memory of one so far
‚Ä≠  In his affection, brought it home, and kept
‚Ä≠  His treasure with it; where till now it slept.
‚Ä≠     And now the Queen of women had intent
‚Ä≠  To give it use, and therefore made ascent
‚Ä≠  Up all the stairs‚Äô height to the chamber door,
‚Ä≠  Whose shining leaves two bright pilasters bore
‚Ä≠  To such a close when both together went
‚Ä≠  It would resist the air in their consent.
‚Ä≠  The ring she took then, and did draw aside
‚Ä≠  A bar that ran within, and then implied
‚Ä≠  The key into the lock, which gave a sound,
‚Ä≠  The bolt then shooting, as in pasture ground
‚Ä≠  A bull doth low, and make the valleys ring;
‚Ä≠  So loud the lock humm‚Äôd when it loos‚Äôd the spring,
‚Ä≠  And ope the doors flew.  In she went, along
‚Ä≠  The lofty chamber, that was boarded strong
‚Ä≠  With heart of oak, which many years ago
‚Ä≠  The architect did smooth and polish so
‚Ä≠  That now as then he made it freshly shine,
‚Ä≠  And tried the evenness of it with a line.
‚Ä≠     There stood in this room presses that enclos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Robes odoriferous, by which repos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The bow was upon pins; nor from it far
‚Ä≠  Hung the round quiver glitt‚Äôring like a star;
‚Ä≠  Both which her white extended hand took down.
‚Ä≠  Then sat she low, and made her lap a crown
‚Ä≠  Of both these relics, which she wept to see,
‚Ä≠  And cried quite out with loving memory
‚Ä≠  Of her dear lord; to whose worth paying then
‚Ä≠  Kind debts enow, she left, and, to the men
‚Ä≠  Vow‚Äôd to her wooing, brought the crooked bow,
‚Ä≠  And shaft-receiving quiver, that did flow
‚Ä≠  With arrows beating sighs up where they fell.
‚Ä≠  Then, with another chest, replete as well
‚Ä≠  With games won by the King, of steel and brass,
‚Ä≠  Her maids attended.  Past whom making pass
‚Ä≠  To where her Wooers were, she made her stay
‚Ä≠  Amidst the fair hall door, and kept the ray
‚Ä≠  Of her bright count‚Äônance hid with veils so thin,
‚Ä≠  That though they seem‚Äôd t‚Äô expose, they let love in;
‚Ä≠  Her maids on both sides stood; and thus she spake:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHear me, ye Wooers, that a pleasure take
‚Ä≠  To do me sorrow, and my house invade
‚Ä≠  To eat and drink, as if ‚Äôtwere only made
‚Ä≠  To serve your rapines; my lord long away,
‚Ä≠  And you allow‚Äôd no colour for your stay
‚Ä≠  But his still absence; striving who shall frame
‚Ä≠  Me for his wife; and, since ‚Äôtis made a game,
‚Ä≠  I here propose divine Ulysses‚Äô bow
‚Ä≠  For that great master-piece to which ye vow.
‚Ä≠  He that can draw it with least show to strive,
‚Ä≠  And through these twelve axe-heads an arrow drive,
‚Ä≠  Him will I follow, and this house forego
‚Ä≠  That nourish‚Äôd me a maid, now furnish‚Äôd so
‚Ä≠  With all things fit, and which I so esteem
‚Ä≠  That I shall still live in it in my dream.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said, she made Eum√¶us give it them.
‚Ä≠  He took and laid it by, and wept for woe;
‚Ä≠  And like him wept Phil≈ìtius, when the bow
‚Ä≠  Of which his king was bearer he beheld.
‚Ä≠  Their tears Antinous‚Äô manhood much refell‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúYe rustic fools!  that still each day
‚Ä≠  Your minds give over to this vain dismay,
‚Ä≠  Why weep ye, wretches, and the widow‚Äôs eyes
‚Ä≠  Tempt with renew‚Äôd thought, that would otherwise
‚Ä≠  Depose her sorrows, since her lord is dead,
‚Ä≠  And tears are idle?  Sit, and eat your bread,
‚Ä≠  Nor whisper more a word; or get ye gone,
‚Ä≠  And weep without doors.  Let this bow alone
‚Ä≠  To our out-match‚Äôd contention.  For I fear
‚Ä≠  The bow will scarce yield draught to any here;
‚Ä≠  Here no such man lives as Laertes‚Äô son
‚Ä≠  Amongst us all.  I knew him; thought puts on
‚Ä≠  His look‚Äôs sight now, methinks, though then a child.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus show‚Äôd his words doubt, yet his hopes instill‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His strength the stretcher of Ulysses‚Äô string,
‚Ä≠  And his steels‚Äô piercer.  But his shaft must sing
‚Ä≠  Through his pierc‚Äôd palate first; whom so he wrong‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In his free roof, and made the rest ill-tongued
‚Ä≠  Against his virtues.  Then the sacred heat
‚Ä≠  That spirited his son did further set
‚Ä≠  Their confidence on fire, and said:  ‚ÄúO friends,
‚Ä≠  Jove hath bereft my wits.  The Queen intends,
‚Ä≠  Though I must grant her wise, ere long to leave
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô court, and to her bed receive
‚Ä≠  Some other lord; yet, notwithstanding, I
‚Ä≠  Am forc‚Äôd to laugh, and set my pleasures high
‚Ä≠  Like one mad sick.  But, Wooers, since ye have
‚Ä≠  An object for your trials now so brave,
‚Ä≠  As all the broad Achaian earth exceeds,
‚Ä≠  As sacred Pylos, as the Argive breeds,
‚Ä≠  As black Epirus, as Mycena‚Äôs birth,
‚Ä≠  And as the more fam‚Äôd Ithacensian earth,
‚Ä≠  All which, yourselves well know, and oft have said--
‚Ä≠  For what need hath my mother of my aid
‚Ä≠  In her advancement?--tender no excuse
‚Ä≠  For least delay, nor too much time profuse
‚Ä≠  In stay to draw this bow, but draw it straight,
‚Ä≠  Shoot, and the steels pierce; make all see how slight
‚Ä≠  You make these poor bars to so rich a prize.
‚Ä≠  No eag‚Äôrer yet?  Come all.  My faculties
‚Ä≠  Shall try the bow‚Äôs strength, and the pierc√©d steel.
‚Ä≠  I will not for my rev‚Äôrend mother feel
‚Ä≠  The sorrows that I know will seize my heart,
‚Ä≠  To see her follow any, and depart
‚Ä≠  From her so long-held home; but first extend
‚Ä≠  The bow and arrow to their tender‚Äôd end.
‚Ä≠  For I am only to succeed my sire
‚Ä≠  In guard of his games, and let none aspire
‚Ä≠  To their besides possession.‚Äù  This said,
‚Ä≠  His purple robe he cast off; by he laid
‚Ä≠  His well-edg‚Äôd sword; and, first, a sev‚Äôral pit
‚Ä≠  He digg‚Äôd for ev‚Äôry axe, and strengthen‚Äôd it
‚Ä≠  With earth close ramm‚Äôd about it; on a rew
‚Ä≠  Set them, of one height, by a line he drew
‚Ä≠  Along the whole twelve; and so orderly
‚Ä≠  Did ev‚Äôry deed belonging (yet his eye
‚Ä≠  Never before beholding how ‚Äôtwas done)
‚Ä≠  That in amaze rose all his lookers-on.
‚Ä≠  Then stood he near the door, and prov‚Äôd to draw
‚Ä≠  The stubborn bow.  Thrice tried, and thrice gave law
‚Ä≠  To his uncrown‚Äôd attempts; the fourth assay
‚Ä≠  With all force off‚Äôring, which a sign gave stay
‚Ä≠  Giv‚Äôn by his father; though he show‚Äôd a mind
‚Ä≠  As if he stood right heartily inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To perfect the exploit, when all was done
‚Ä≠  In only drift to set the Wooers on.
‚Ä≠  His weakness yet confess‚Äôd, he said:  ‚ÄúO shame!
‚Ä≠  I either shall be ever of no name,
‚Ä≠  But prove a wretch; or else I am too young,
‚Ä≠  And must not now presume on pow‚Äôrs so strong
‚Ä≠  As sinews yet more growing may engraft,
‚Ä≠  To turn a man quite over with a shaft.
‚Ä≠  Besides, to men whose nerves are best prepar‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  _All great adventures at first proof are hard._
‚Ä≠  But come, you stronger men, attempt this bow,
‚Ä≠  And let us end our labour.‚Äù  Thus, below
‚Ä≠  A well-join‚Äôd board he laid it, and close by
‚Ä≠  The brightly-headed shaft; then thron‚Äôd his thigh
‚Ä≠  Amidst his late-left seat.  Antinous then
‚Ä≠  Bade all arise; but first, who did sustain
‚Ä≠  The cup‚Äôs state ever, and did sacrifice
‚Ä≠  Before they ate still, and that man bade rise,
‚Ä≠  Since on the other‚Äôs right hand he was plac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Because he held the right hand‚Äôs rising, grac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With best success still.  This discretion won
‚Ä≠  Supreme applause; and first rose ≈ínops‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  Liodes, that was priest to all the rest,
‚Ä≠  Sat lowest with the cup still, and their jest
‚Ä≠  Could never like, but ever was the man
‚Ä≠  That check‚Äôd their follies; and he now began
‚Ä≠  To taste the bow, the sharp shaft took, tugg‚Äôd hard,
‚Ä≠  And held aloft, and, till he quite had marr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His delicate tender fingers, could not stir
‚Ä≠  The churlish string; who therefore did refer
‚Ä≠  The game to others, saying, that same bow,
‚Ä≠  In his presage, would prove the overthrow
‚Ä≠  Of many a chief man there; nor thought the fate
‚Ä≠  Was any whit austere, since death‚Äôs short date
‚Ä≠  Were much the better taken, than long life
‚Ä≠  Without the object of their amorous strife,
‚Ä≠  For whom they had burn‚Äôd-out so many days
‚Ä≠  To find still other, nothing but delays
‚Ä≠  Obtaining in them; and affirm‚Äôd that now
‚Ä≠  Some hop‚Äôd to have her, but when that tough bow
‚Ä≠  They all had tried, and seen the utmost done,
‚Ä≠  They must rest pleas‚Äôd to cease; and now some one
‚Ä≠  Of all their other fair-veil‚Äôd Grecian dames
‚Ä≠  With gifts, and dower, and Hymeneal flames,
‚Ä≠  Let her love light to him that most will give,
‚Ä≠  And whom the nuptial destiny did drive.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus laid he on the well-join‚Äôd polish‚Äôd board
‚Ä≠  The bow and bright-pil‚Äôd shaft, and then restor‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His seat his right.  To him Antinous
‚Ä≠  Gave bitter language, and reprov‚Äôd him thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúWhat words, Liodes, pass thy speech‚Äôs guard,
‚Ä≠  That ‚Äôtis a work to bear, and set so hard
‚Ä≠  They set up my disdain!  This bow must end
‚Ä≠  The best of us? Since thy arms cannot lend
‚Ä≠  The string least motion? Thy mother‚Äôs throes
‚Ä≠  Brought never forth thy arms to draught of bows,
‚Ä≠  Or knitting shafts off.  Though thou canst not draw
‚Ä≠  The sturdy plant, thou art to us no law.
‚Ä≠  Melanthius!  Light a fire, and set thereat
‚Ä≠  A chair and cushions, and that mass of fat
‚Ä≠  That lies within bring out, that we may set
‚Ä≠  Our pages to this bow, to see it het
‚Ä≠  And suppled with the suet, and then we
‚Ä≠  May give it draught, and pay this great decree
‚Ä≠  Utmost performance.‚Äù  He a mighty fire
‚Ä≠  Gave instant flame, put into act th‚Äô entire
‚Ä≠  Command laid on him, chair and cushions set,
‚Ä≠  Laid on the bow, which straight the pages het,
‚Ä≠  Chaf‚Äôd, suppled with the suet to their most;
‚Ä≠  And still was all their unctuous labour lost,
‚Ä≠  All Wooers‚Äô strengths too indigent and poor
‚Ä≠  To draw that bow; Antinous‚Äô arms it tore,
‚Ä≠  And great Eurymachus‚Äô, the both clear best,
‚Ä≠  Yet both it tir‚Äôd, and made them glad to rest.
‚Ä≠  Forth then went both the swains, and after them
‚Ä≠  Divine Ulysses; when, being past th‚Äô extreme
‚Ä≠  Of all the gates, with winning words he tried
‚Ä≠  Their loves, and this ask‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúShall my counsels hide
‚Ä≠  Their depths from you? My mind would gladly know
‚Ä≠  If suddenly Ulysses had his vow
‚Ä≠  Made good for home, and had some God to guide
‚Ä≠  His steps and strokes to wreak these Wooers‚Äô pride,
‚Ä≠  Would your aids join on his part, or with theirs?
‚Ä≠  How stand your hearts affected?‚Äù  They made pray‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  That some God would please to return their lord,
‚Ä≠  He then should see how far they would afford
‚Ä≠  Their lives for his.  He, seeing their truth, replied;
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúI am your lord, through many a suff‚Äôrance tried,
‚Ä≠  Arriv‚Äôd now here, whom twenty years have held
‚Ä≠  From forth my country.  Yet are not conceal‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  From my sure knowledge your desires to see
‚Ä≠  My safe return.  Of all the company
‚Ä≠  Now serving here besides, not one but you
‚Ä≠  Mine ear hath witness‚Äôd willing to bestow
‚Ä≠  Their wishes of my life, so long held dead.
‚Ä≠  I therefore vow, which shall be perfected,
‚Ä≠  That if God please beneath my hand to leave
‚Ä≠  These Wooers lifeless, ye shall both receive
‚Ä≠  Wives from that hand, and means, and near to me
‚Ä≠  Have houses built to you, and both shall be
‚Ä≠  As friends and brothers to my only son.
‚Ä≠  And, that ye well may know me, and be won
‚Ä≠  To that assurance, the infallible sign
‚Ä≠  The white-tooth‚Äôd boar gave, this mark‚Äôd knee of mine,
‚Ä≠  When in Parnassus he was held in chase
‚Ä≠  By me, and by my famous grandsire‚Äôs race,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll let you see.‚Äù  Thus sever‚Äôd he his weed
‚Ä≠  From that his wound; and ev‚Äôry word had deed
‚Ä≠  In their sure knowledges.  Which made them cast
‚Ä≠  Their arms about him, his broad breast embrac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  His neck and shoulders kiss‚Äôd.  And him as well
‚Ä≠  Did those true pow‚Äôrs of human love compell
‚Ä≠  To kiss their heads and hands, and to their moan
‚Ä≠  Had sent the free light of the cheerful sun,
‚Ä≠  Had not Ulysses broke the ruth, and said;
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúCease tears and sorrows, lest we prove display‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By some that issue from the house, and they
‚Ä≠  Relate to those within.  Take each his way,
‚Ä≠  Not altogether in, but one by one,
‚Ä≠  First I, then you; and then see this be done;
‚Ä≠  The envious Wooers will by no means give
‚Ä≠  The offer of the bow and arrow leave
‚Ä≠  To come at me; spite then their pride, do thou,
‚Ä≠  My good Eum√¶us, bring both shaft and bow
‚Ä≠  To my hand‚Äôs proof; and charge the maids before
‚Ä≠  That instantly they shut in ev‚Äôry door,
‚Ä≠  That they themselves (if any tumult rise
‚Ä≠  Beneath my roofs by any that envies
‚Ä≠  My will to undertake the game) may gain
‚Ä≠  No passage forth, but close at work contain
‚Ä≠  With all free quiet, or at least constrain‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And therefore, my Phil≈ìtius, see maintain‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  When close the gates are shut, their closure fast,
‚Ä≠  To which end be it thy sole work to cast
‚Ä≠  Their chains before them.‚Äù  This said, in he led,
‚Ä≠  Took first his seat; and then they seconded
‚Ä≠  His entry with their own.  Then took in hand
‚Ä≠  Eurymachus the bow, made close his stand
‚Ä≠  Aside the fire, at whose heat here and there
‚Ä≠  He warm‚Äôd and suppled it, yet could not stere
‚Ä≠  To any draught the string, with all his art;
‚Ä≠  And therefore swell‚Äôd in him his glorious heart,
‚Ä≠  Affirming,  ‚Äúthat himself and all his friends
‚Ä≠  Had cause to grieve, not only that their ends
‚Ä≠  They miss‚Äôd in marriage, since enough besides
‚Ä≠  Kind Grecian dames there liv‚Äôd to be their brides
‚Ä≠  In Ithaca, and other bord‚Äôring towns,
‚Ä≠  But that to all times future their renowns
‚Ä≠  Would stand disparag‚Äôd, if Ulysses‚Äô bow
‚Ä≠  They could not draw, and yet his wife would woo.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Antinous answer‚Äôd;  ‚ÄúThat there could ensue
‚Ä≠  No shame at all to them; for well he knew
‚Ä≠  That this day was kept holy to the Sun
‚Ä≠  By all the city, and there should be done
‚Ä≠  No such profane act, therefore bade lay by
‚Ä≠  The bow for that day; but the mastery
‚Ä≠  Of axes that were set up still might stand,
‚Ä≠  Since that no labour was, nor any hand
‚Ä≠  Would offer to invade Ulysses‚Äô house,
‚Ä≠  To take, or touch with surreptitious
‚Ä≠  Or violent hand, what there was left for use.
‚Ä≠  He, therefore, bade the cup-bearer infuse
‚Ä≠  Wine to the bowls, that so with sacrifice
‚Ä≠  They might let rest the shooting exercise,
‚Ä≠  And in the morning make Melanthius bring
‚Ä≠  The chief goats of his herd, that to the King
‚Ä≠  Of bows and archers they might burn the thighs
‚Ä≠  For good success, and then attempt the prize.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The rest sat pleas‚Äôd with this.  The heralds straight
‚Ä≠  Pour‚Äôd water on their hands; each page did wait
‚Ä≠  With his crown‚Äôd cup of wine, serv‚Äôd ev‚Äôry man
‚Ä≠  Till all were satisfied.  And then began
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô plot of his close purpose thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHear me, ye much renown‚Äôd Eurymachus,
‚Ä≠  And king Antinous, in chief, who well,
‚Ä≠  And with decorum sacred, doth compell
‚Ä≠  This day‚Äôs observance, and to let lay down
‚Ä≠  The bow all this light, giving Gods their own.
‚Ä≠  The morning‚Äôs labour God the more will bless,
‚Ä≠  And strength bestow where he himself shall please.
‚Ä≠  Against which time let me presume to pray
‚Ä≠  Your favours with the rest, that this assay
‚Ä≠  May my old arms prove, trying if there lie
‚Ä≠  In my poor pow‚Äôrs the same activity
‚Ä≠  That long since crown‚Äôd them; or if needy fare
‚Ä≠  And desolate wand‚Äôring have the web worn bare
‚Ä≠  Of my life‚Äôs thread at all parts, that no more
‚Ä≠  Can furnish these affairs as heretofore.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This het their spleens past measure, blown with fear
‚Ä≠  Lest his loath‚Äôd temples would the garland wear
‚Ä≠  Of that bow‚Äôs draught; Antinous using speech
‚Ä≠  To this sour purpose:  ‚ÄúThou most arrant wretch
‚Ä≠  Of all guests breathing, in no least degree
‚Ä≠  Grac‚Äôd with a human soul, it serves not thee
‚Ä≠  To feast in peace with us, take equal share
‚Ä≠  Of what we reach to, sit, and all things hear
‚Ä≠  That we speak freely,--which no begging guest
‚Ä≠  Did ever yet,--but thou must make request
‚Ä≠  To mix with us in merit of the Queen.
‚Ä≠  But wine inflames thee, that hath ever been
‚Ä≠  The bane of men whoever yet would take
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô excess it offers and the mean forsake.
‚Ä≠  Wine spoil‚Äôd the Centaur great Eurytion,
‚Ä≠  In guest-rites with the mighty-minded son
‚Ä≠  Of bold Ixion, in his way to war
‚Ä≠  Against the Lapithes; who, driv‚Äôn as far
‚Ä≠  As madness with the bold effects of wine,
‚Ä≠  Did outrage to his kind host, and decline
‚Ä≠  Other hero√´s from him feasted there
‚Ä≠  With so much anger that they left their cheer,
‚Ä≠  And dragg‚Äôd him forth the fore-court, slit his nose,
‚Ä≠  Cropp‚Äôd both his ears, and, in the ill-dispose
‚Ä≠  His mind then suffer‚Äôd, drew the fatal day
‚Ä≠  On his head with his host; for thence the fray
‚Ä≠  Betwixt the Centaurs and the Lapithes
‚Ä≠  Had mortal act.  But he for his excess
‚Ä≠  In spoil of wine fared worse himself; as thou
‚Ä≠  For thy large cups, if thy arms draw the bow,
‚Ä≠  My mind fortells shalt fear; for not a man
‚Ä≠  Of all our consort, that in wisdom can
‚Ä≠  Boast any fit share, will take prayers then,
‚Ä≠  But to Echetus, the most stern of men,
‚Ä≠  A black sail freight with thee, whose worst of ill,
‚Ä≠  Be sure, is past all ransom.  Sit, then, still,
‚Ä≠  Drink temp‚Äôrately, and never more contend
‚Ä≠  With men your youngers.‚Äù  This the Queen did end
‚Ä≠  With her defence of him, and told his foe
‚Ä≠  It was not fair nor equal t‚Äô overcrow
‚Ä≠  The poorest guest her son pleas‚Äôd t‚Äô entertain
‚Ä≠  In his free turrets with so proud a strain
‚Ä≠  Of threats and bravings; asking if he thought,
‚Ä≠  That if the stranger to his arms had brought
‚Ä≠  The stubborn bow down, he should marry her,
‚Ä≠  And bear her home?  And said, himself should err
‚Ä≠  In no such hope; nor of them all the best
‚Ä≠  That griev‚Äôd at any good she did her guest
‚Ä≠  Should banquet there; since it in no sort show‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Noblesse in them, nor paid her what she ow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Her own free rule there.  This Eurymachus
‚Ä≠  Confirm‚Äôd and said:  ‚ÄúNor feeds it hope in us,
‚Ä≠  Icarius‚Äô daughter, to solemnize rites
‚Ä≠  Of nuptials with thee; nor in noblest sights
‚Ä≠  It can show comely; but to our respects
‚Ä≠  The rumour both of sexes and of sects
‚Ä≠  Amongst the people would breed shame and fear,
‚Ä≠  Lest any worst Greek said:  ‚ÄòSee, men that were
‚Ä≠  Of mean deservings will presume t‚Äô aspire
‚Ä≠  To his wife‚Äôs bed, whom all men did admire
‚Ä≠  For fame and merit, could not draw his bow,
‚Ä≠  And yet his wife had foolish pride to woo,
‚Ä≠  When straight an errant beggar comes and draws
‚Ä≠  The bow with ease, performing all the laws
‚Ä≠  The game besides contain‚Äôd‚Äô;  and this would thus
‚Ä≠  Prove both indignity and shame to us.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The Queen replied:  ‚ÄúThe fame of men, I see,
‚Ä≠  Bears much price in your great suppos‚Äôd degree;
‚Ä≠  Yet who can prove amongst the people great,
‚Ä≠  That of one so esteem‚Äôd of them the seat
‚Ä≠  Doth so defame and ruin?  And beside,
‚Ä≠  With what right is this guest thus vilified
‚Ä≠  In your high censures, when the man in blood
‚Ä≠  Is well compos‚Äôd and great, his parents good?  [1]
‚Ä≠  And therefore give the bow to him, to try
‚Ä≠  His birth and breeding by his chivalry.
‚Ä≠  If his arms draw it, and that Ph≈ìbus stands
‚Ä≠  So great a glory to his strength, my hands
‚Ä≠  Shall add this guerdon:  Ev‚Äôry sort of weed,
‚Ä≠  A two-edg‚Äôd sword, and lance to keep him freed
‚Ä≠  From dogs and men hereafter, and dismiss
‚Ä≠  His worth to what place tends that heart of his.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Her son gave answer:  ‚ÄúThat it was a wrong
‚Ä≠  To his free sway in all things that belong
‚Ä≠  To guard of that house, to demand the bow
‚Ä≠  Of any Wooer, and the use bestow
‚Ä≠  Upon the stranger:  for the bow was his
‚Ä≠  To give or to withhold; no masteries
‚Ä≠  Of her proposing giving any pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô impair his right in things for any Wooer,
‚Ä≠  Or any that rough Ithaca affords,
‚Ä≠  Any that Elis; of which no man‚Äôs words
‚Ä≠  Nor pow‚Äôrs should curb him, stood he so inclin‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  To see the bow in absolute gift resign‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To that his guest to bear and use at will,
‚Ä≠  And therefore bade his mother keep her still
‚Ä≠  Amongst her women at her rock and loom;
‚Ä≠  Bows were for men; and this bow did become
‚Ä≠  Past all men‚Äôs his disposure, since his sire
‚Ä≠  Left it to him, and all the house entire.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She stood dismay‚Äôd at this, and in her mind
‚Ä≠  His wise words laid up, standing so inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  As he had will‚Äôd, with all her women going
‚Ä≠  Up to her chamber, there her tears bestowing,
‚Ä≠  As ev‚Äôry night she did, on her lov‚Äôd lord,
‚Ä≠  Till sleep and Pallas her fit rest restor‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     The bow Eum√¶us took, and bore away;
‚Ä≠  Which up in tumult, and almost in fray,
‚Ä≠  Put all the Wooers, one enquiring thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúWhither, rogue, abject, wilt thou bear from us
‚Ä≠  That bow propos‚Äôd?  Lay down, or I protest
‚Ä≠  Thy dogs shall eat thee, that thou nourishest
‚Ä≠  To guard thy swine; amongst whom, left of all,
‚Ä≠  Thy life shall leave thee, if the festival,
‚Ä≠  We now observe to Ph≈ìbus, may our zeals
‚Ä≠  Grace with his aid, and all the Deities else.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This threat made good Eum√¶us yield the bow
‚Ä≠  To his late place, not knowing what might grow
‚Ä≠  From such a multitude.  And then fell on
‚Ä≠  Telemachus with threats, and said:  ‚ÄúSet gone
‚Ä≠  That bow yet further; ‚Äôtis no servant‚Äôs part
‚Ä≠  To serve too many masters; raise your heart
‚Ä≠  And bear it off, lest, though you‚Äôre younger, yet
‚Ä≠  With stones I pelt you to the field with it.
‚Ä≠  If you and I close, I shall prove too strong.
‚Ä≠  I wish as much too hard for all this throng
‚Ä≠  The Gods would make me, I should quickly send
‚Ä≠  Some after with just sorrow to their end,
‚Ä≠  They waste my victuals so, and ply my cup,
‚Ä≠  And do me such shrewd turns still.‚Äù  This put up
‚Ä≠  The Wooers all in laughters, and put down
‚Ä≠  Their angers to him, that so late were grown
‚Ä≠  So grave and bloody; which resolv‚Äôd that fear
‚Ä≠  Of good Eum√¶us, who did take and bear
‚Ä≠  The King the bow; call‚Äôd nurse, and bade her make
‚Ä≠  The doors all sure, that if men‚Äôs tumults take
‚Ä≠  The ears of some within, they may not fly,
‚Ä≠  But keep at work still close and silently.
‚Ä≠     These words put wings to her, and close she put
‚Ä≠  The chamber door.  The court-gates then were shut
‚Ä≠  By kind Phil≈ìtius, who straight did go
‚Ä≠  From out the hall, and in the portico
‚Ä≠  Found laid a gable of a ship, compos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of spongy bulrushes; with which he clos‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  In winding round about them, the court-gates,
‚Ä≠  Then took his place again, to view the fates
‚Ä≠  That quickly follow‚Äôd.  When he came, he saw
‚Ä≠  Ulysses viewing, ere he tried to draw,
‚Ä≠  The famous bow, which ev‚Äôry way he mov‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Up and down turning it; in which be prov‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The plight it was in, fearing, chiefly, lest
‚Ä≠  The horns were eat with worms in so long rest.
‚Ä≠  But what his thoughts intended turning so,
‚Ä≠  And keeping such a search about the bow,
‚Ä≠  The Wooers little knowing fell to jest,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúPast doubt he is a man profest
‚Ä≠  In bowyers‚Äô craft, and sees quite through the wood;
‚Ä≠  Or something, certain, to be understood
‚Ä≠  There is in this his turning of it still.
‚Ä≠  A cunning rogue he is at any ill.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Then spake another proud one:  ‚ÄúWould to heav‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  I might, at will, get gold till he hath giv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  That bow his draught!‚Äù  With these sharp jests did these
‚Ä≠  Delightsome Woo‚Äôrs their fatal humours please.
‚Ä≠  But when the wise Ulysses once had laid
‚Ä≠  His fingers on it, and to proof survey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The still sound plight it held, as one of skill
‚Ä≠  In song, and of the harp, doth at his will,
‚Ä≠  In tuning of his instrument, extend
‚Ä≠  A string out with his pin, touch all, and lend
‚Ä≠  To ev‚Äôry well-wreath‚Äôd string his perfect sound,
‚Ä≠  Struck all together; with such ease drew round
‚Ä≠  The King the bow.  Then twang‚Äôd he up the string,
‚Ä≠  That as a swallow in the air doth sing
‚Ä≠  With no continued tune, but, pausing still,
‚Ä≠  Twinks out her scatter‚Äôd voice in accents shrill;
‚Ä≠  So sharp the string sung when he gave it touch,
‚Ä≠  Once having bent and drawn it.  Which so much
‚Ä≠  Amaz‚Äôd the Wooers, that their colours went
‚Ä≠  And came most grievously.  And then Jove rent
‚Ä≠  The air with thunder; which at heart did cheer
‚Ä≠  The now-enough-sustaining traveller,
‚Ä≠  That Jove again would his attempt enable.
‚Ä≠  Then took he into hand, from off the table,
‚Ä≠  The first drawn arrow:  and a number more
‚Ä≠  Spent shortly on the Wooers; but this one
‚Ä≠  He measur‚Äôd by his arm, as if not known
‚Ä≠  The length were to him, nock‚Äôd it then, and drew;
‚Ä≠  And through the axes, at the first hole, flew
‚Ä≠  The steel-charg‚Äôd arrow; which when he had done
‚Ä≠  He thus bespake the Prince:  ‚ÄúYou have not won
‚Ä≠  Disgrace yet by your guest; for I have strook
‚Ä≠  The mark I shot at, and no such toil took
‚Ä≠  In wearying the bow with fat and fire
‚Ä≠  As did the Wooers.  Yet reserv‚Äôd entire,
‚Ä≠  Thank Heav‚Äôn, my strength is, and myself am tried,
‚Ä≠  No man to be so basely vilified
‚Ä≠  As these men pleas‚Äôd to think me.  But, free way
‚Ä≠  Take that, and all their pleasures; and while day
‚Ä≠  Holds her torch to you, and the hour of feast
‚Ä≠  Hath now full date, give banquet, and the rest,
‚Ä≠  Poem and harp, that grace a well-fill‚Äôd board.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he beckon‚Äôd to his son; whose sword
‚Ä≠  He straight girt to him, took to hand his lance,
‚Ä≠  And c√≥mplete-arm‚Äôd did to his sire advance.

‚Ä≠  THE TWENTY-SECOND BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  The Wooers in Minerva‚Äôs sight
‚Ä≠  Slain by Ulysses; all the light
‚Ä≠  And lustful housewives by his son
‚Ä≠  And servants are to slaughter done.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _ŒßŒπÃë._
‚Ä≠     The end of pride,
‚Ä≠        And lawless lust,
‚Ä≠     Is wretched tried
‚Ä≠        With slaughters just.

‚Ä≠  The upper rags that wise Ulysses wore
‚Ä≠  Cast off, he rusheth to the great hall door
‚Ä≠  With bow and quiver full of shafts, which down
‚Ä≠  He pour‚Äôd before his feet, and thus made known
‚Ä≠  His true state to the Wooers:  ‚ÄúThis strife thus
‚Ä≠  Hath harmless been decided; now for us
‚Ä≠  There rests another mark, more hard to hit,
‚Ä≠  And such as never man before hath smit;
‚Ä≠  Whose full point likewise my hands shall assay,
‚Ä≠  And try if Ph≈ìbus will give me his day.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He said, and off his bitter arrow thrust
‚Ä≠  Right at Antinous; and struck him just
‚Ä≠  As he was lifting up the bowl, to show
‚Ä≠  That ‚Äôtwixt the cup and lip much ill may grow.
‚Ä≠  Death touch‚Äôd not at his thoughts at feast; for who
‚Ä≠  Would think that he alone could perish so
‚Ä≠  Amongst so many, and he best of all?
‚Ä≠  The arrow in his throat took full his fall,
‚Ä≠  And thrust his head far through the other side.
‚Ä≠  Down fell his cup, down he, down all his pride;
‚Ä≠  Straight from his nostrils gush‚Äôd the human gore;
‚Ä≠  And, as he fell, his feet far overbore
‚Ä≠  The feastful table; all the roast and bread
‚Ä≠  About the house strew‚Äôd.  When his high-born head
‚Ä≠  The rest beheld so low, up rush‚Äôd they all,
‚Ä≠  And ransack‚Äôd ev‚Äôry corner of the hall
‚Ä≠  For shields and darts; but all fled far their reach.
‚Ä≠  Then fell they foul on him with terrible speech,
‚Ä≠  And told him it should prove the dearest shaft
‚Ä≠  That ever pass‚Äôd him; and that now was saft
‚Ä≠  No shift for him, but sure and sudden death;
‚Ä≠  For he had slain a man, whose like did breathe
‚Ä≠  In no part of the kingdom; and that now
‚Ä≠  He should no more for games strive with his bow,
‚Ä≠  But vultures eat him there.  These threats they spent,
‚Ä≠  Yet ev‚Äôry man believ‚Äôd that stern event
‚Ä≠  Chanc‚Äôd ‚Äôgainst the author‚Äôs will.  O fools, to think
‚Ä≠  That all their rest had any cup to drink
‚Ä≠  But what their great Antinous began!
‚Ä≠     He, frowning, said:  ‚ÄúDogs, see in me the man
‚Ä≠  Ye all held dead at Troy.  My house it is
‚Ä≠  That thus ye spoil, and thus your luxuries
‚Ä≠  File with my women‚Äôs rapes; in which ye woo
‚Ä≠  The wife of one that lives, and no thought show
‚Ä≠  Of man‚Äôs fit fear, or God‚Äôs, your present fame,
‚Ä≠  Or any fair sense of your future name;
‚Ä≠  And, therefore, present and eternal death
‚Ä≠  Shall end your base life.‚Äù  This made fresh fears breathe
‚Ä≠  Their former boldness.  Ev‚Äôry man had eye
‚Ä≠  On all the means, and studied ways to fly
‚Ä≠  So deep deaths imminent.  But seeing none,
‚Ä≠  Eurymachus began with suppliant moan
‚Ä≠  To move his pity, saying:  ‚ÄúIf you be
‚Ä≠  This isle‚Äôs Ulysses, we must all agree,
‚Ä≠  In grant of your reproof‚Äôs integrity,
‚Ä≠  The Greeks have done you many a wrong at home,
‚Ä≠  At field as many.  But of all the sum
‚Ä≠  Lies here contract in death; for only he
‚Ä≠  Impos‚Äôd the whole ill-offices that we
‚Ä≠  Are now made guilty of, and not so much
‚Ä≠  Sought his endeavours, or in thought did touch
‚Ä≠  At any nuptials, but a greater thing
‚Ä≠  Employ‚Äôd his forces; for to be our king
‚Ä≠  Was his chief object; his sole plot it was
‚Ä≠  To kill your son, which Jove‚Äôs hand would not pass,
‚Ä≠  But set it to his own most merited end.
‚Ä≠  In which end your just anger, nor extend
‚Ä≠  Your stern wreak further; spend your royal pow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  In mild ruth of your people; we are yours;
‚Ä≠  And whatsoever waste of wine or food
‚Ä≠  Our liberties have made, we‚Äôll make all good
‚Ä≠  In restitutions.  Call a court, and pass
‚Ä≠  A fine of twenty oxen, gold, and brass,
‚Ä≠  On ev‚Äôry head, and raise your most rates still,
‚Ä≠  Till you are pleas‚Äôd with your confess√©d fill.
‚Ä≠  Which if we fail to tender, all your wrath
‚Ä≠  It shall be justice in our bloods to bathe.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúEurymachus,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúif you would give
‚Ä≠  All that your fathers‚Äô hoard, to make ye live,
‚Ä≠  And all that ever you yourselves possess,
‚Ä≠  Or shall by any industry increase,
‚Ä≠  I would not cease from slaughter, till your bloods
‚Ä≠  Had bought out your intemp‚Äôrance in my goods.
‚Ä≠  It rests now for you that you either fight
‚Ä≠  That will ‚Äôscape death, or make your way by flight.
‚Ä≠  In whose best choice, my thoughts conceive, not one
‚Ä≠  Shall shun the death your first hath undergone.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This quite dissolv‚Äôd their knees.  Eurymachus,
‚Ä≠  Enforcing all their fears, yet counsell‚Äôd thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO friends!  This man, now he hath got the bow
‚Ä≠  And quiver by him, ever will bestow
‚Ä≠  His most inaccessible hands at us,
‚Ä≠  And never leave, if we avoid him thus,
‚Ä≠  Till he hath strewn the pavement with us all;
‚Ä≠  And, therefore, join we swords, and on him fall
‚Ä≠  With tables forc‚Äôd up, and borne in oppos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Against his sharp shafts; when, being round-enclos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By all our onsets, we shall either take
‚Ä≠  His horrid person, or for safety make
‚Ä≠  His rage retire from out the hall and gates;
‚Ä≠  And then, if he escape, we‚Äôll make our states
‚Ä≠  Known to the city by our gen‚Äôral cry.
‚Ä≠  And thus this man shall let his last shaft fly
‚Ä≠  That ever his hand vaunted.‚Äù  Thus he drew
‚Ä≠  His sharp-edg‚Äôd sword; and with a table flew
‚Ä≠  In on Ulysses, with a terrible throat
‚Ä≠  His fierce charge urging.  But Ulysses smote
‚Ä≠  The board, and cleft it through from end to end
‚Ä≠  Borne at his breast; and made his shaft extend
‚Ä≠  His sharp head to his liver, his broad breast
‚Ä≠  Pierc‚Äôd at his nipple; when his hand releast
‚Ä≠  Forthwith his sword, that fell and kiss‚Äôd the ground,
‚Ä≠  With cups and victuals lying scatter‚Äôd round
‚Ä≠  About the pavement; amongst which his brow
‚Ä≠  Knock‚Äôd the imbrued earth, while in pains did flow
‚Ä≠  His vital spirits, till his heels shook out
‚Ä≠  His feastful life, and hurl‚Äôd a throne about
‚Ä≠  That way-laid death‚Äôs convulsions in his feet;
‚Ä≠  When from his tender eyes the light did fleet.
‚Ä≠     Then charg‚Äôd Amphinomus with his drawn blade
‚Ä≠  The glorious king, in purpose to have made
‚Ä≠  His feet forsake the house; but his assay
‚Ä≠  The prince prevented, and his lance gave way
‚Ä≠  Quite through his shoulder, at his back; his breast
‚Ä≠  The fierce pile letting forth.  His ruin prest
‚Ä≠  Groans from the pavement, which his forehead strook.
‚Ä≠     Telemachus his long lance then forsook--
‚Ä≠  Left in Amphinomus--and to his sire
‚Ä≠  Made fiery pass, not staying to acquire
‚Ä≠  His lance again, in doubt that, while he drew
‚Ä≠  The fix√©d pile, some other might renew
‚Ä≠  Fierce charge upon him, and his unharm‚Äôd head
‚Ä≠  Cleave with his back-drawn sword; for which he fled
‚Ä≠  Close to his father, bade him arm, and he
‚Ä≠  Would bring him shield and jav‚Äôlins instantly,
‚Ä≠  His own head arming, more arms laying by
‚Ä≠  To serve the swine-herd and the oxen-herd.
‚Ä≠  _Valour well arm‚Äôd is ever most preferr‚Äôd._
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúRun then,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúand come before the last
‚Ä≠  Of these auxiliary shafts are past,
‚Ä≠  For fear, lest, left alone, they force my stand
‚Ä≠  From forth the ports.‚Äù  He flew, and brought to hand
‚Ä≠  Eight darts, four shields, four helms.  His own parts then
‚Ä≠  First put in arms, he furnish‚Äôd both his men,
‚Ä≠  That to their king stood close; but he, as long
‚Ä≠  As he had shafts to friend, enough was strong
‚Ä≠  For all the Wooers, and some one man still
‚Ä≠  He made make even with earth, till all a hill
‚Ä≠  Had rais‚Äôd in th‚Äô even-floor‚Äôd hall.  His last shaft spent,
‚Ä≠  He set his bow against a beam, and went
‚Ä≠  To arm at all parts, while the other three
‚Ä≠  Kept off the Wooers, who, unarm‚Äôd, could be
‚Ä≠  No great assailants.  In the well-built wall
‚Ä≠  A window was thrust out, at end of all
‚Ä≠  The house‚Äôs entry; on whose utter side
‚Ä≠  There lay a way to town, and in it wide
‚Ä≠  And two-leav‚Äôd folds were forg‚Äôd, that gave fit mean
‚Ä≠  For flyers-out; and, therefore, at it then
‚Ä≠  Ulysses plac‚Äôd Eum√¶us in close guard;
‚Ä≠  One only pass ope to it, which (prepar‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In this sort by Ulysses ‚Äôgainst all pass)
‚Ä≠  By Agelaus‚Äô tardy memory was
‚Ä≠  In question call‚Äôd, who bade some one ascend
‚Ä≠  At such a window, and bring straight to friend
‚Ä≠  The city with his clamour, that this man
‚Ä≠  Might quickly shoot his last.  ‚ÄúThis no one can
‚Ä≠  Make safe access to,‚Äù  said Melanthius,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúFor ‚Äôtis too near the hall‚Äôs fair doors, whence thus
‚Ä≠  The man afflicts ye; for from thence there lies
‚Ä≠  But one strait passage to it, that denies
‚Ä≠  Access to all, if any one man stand,
‚Ä≠  Being one of courage, and will countermand
‚Ä≠  Our offer to it.  But I know a way
‚Ä≠  To bring you arms, from where the King doth lay
‚Ä≠  His whole munition; and believe there is
‚Ä≠  No other place to all the armories
‚Ä≠  Both of himself and son.‚Äù  This said, a pair
‚Ä≠  Of lofty stairs he climb‚Äôd, and to th‚Äô affair
‚Ä≠  Twelve shields, twelve lances brought, as many casques
‚Ä≠  With horsehair plumes; and set to bitter tasks
‚Ä≠  Both son and sire.  Then shrunk Ulysses‚Äô knees,
‚Ä≠  And his lov‚Äôd heart, when thus in arms he sees
‚Ä≠  So many Wooers, and their shaken darts;
‚Ä≠  For then the work show‚Äôd as it ask‚Äôd more parts
‚Ä≠  To safe performance, and he told his son
‚Ä≠  That or Melanthius or his maids had done
‚Ä≠  A deed that foul war to their hands conferr‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO father,‚Äù  he replied,  ‚Äú‚Äôtis I have err‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In this caus‚Äôd labour; I, and none but I,
‚Ä≠  That left the door ope of your armoury.
‚Ä≠  But some, it seems, hath set a sharper eye
‚Ä≠  On that important place.  Eum√¶us!  Haste
‚Ä≠  And shut the door, observing who hath past
‚Ä≠  To this false action; any maid, or one
‚Ä≠  That I suspect more, which is Dolius‚Äô son.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     While these spake thus, Melanthius went again
‚Ä≠  For more fair arms; when the renown√©d swain
‚Ä≠  Eum√¶us saw, and told Ulysses straight
‚Ä≠  It was the hateful man that his conceit
‚Ä≠  Before suspected, who had done that ill;
‚Ä≠  And, being again there, ask‚Äôd if he should kill,
‚Ä≠  If his pow‚Äôr serv‚Äôd, or he should bring the swain
‚Ä≠  To him, t‚Äô inflict on him a sev‚Äôral pain
‚Ä≠  For ev‚Äôry forfeit he had made his house.
‚Ä≠     He answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúI and my Telemachus
‚Ä≠  Will here contain these proud ones in despite,
‚Ä≠  How much soever these stol‚Äôn arms excite
‚Ä≠  Their guilty courages, while you two take
‚Ä≠  Possession of the chamber.  The doors make
‚Ä≠  Sure at your back, and then, surprising him,
‚Ä≠  His feet and hands bind, wrapping ev‚Äôry limb
‚Ä≠  In pliant chains; and with a halter cast
‚Ä≠  Above the wind-beam--at himself made fast--
‚Ä≠  Aloft the column draw him; where alive
‚Ä≠  He long may hang, and pains enough deprive
‚Ä≠  His vex√©d life before his death succeed.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This charge, soon heard, as soon they put to deed,
‚Ä≠  Stole on his stealth, and at the further end
‚Ä≠  Of all the chamber saw him busily bend
‚Ä≠  His hands to more arms, when they, still at door,
‚Ä≠  Watch‚Äôd his return.  At last he came, and bore
‚Ä≠  In one hand a fair helm, in th‚Äô other held
‚Ä≠  A broad and ancient rusty-rested shield,
‚Ä≠  That old Laertes in his youth had worn,
‚Ä≠  Of which the cheek-bands had with age been torn.
‚Ä≠  They rush‚Äôd upon him, caught him by the hair,
‚Ä≠  And dragg‚Äôd him in again; whom, crying out,
‚Ä≠  They cast upon the pavement, wrapp‚Äôd about
‚Ä≠  With sure and pinching cords both foot and hand,
‚Ä≠  And then, in full act of their King‚Äôs command,
‚Ä≠  A pliant chain bestow‚Äôd on him, and hal‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His body up the column, till he scal‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The highest wind-beam; where made firmly fast,
‚Ä≠  Eum√¶us on his just infliction past
‚Ä≠  This pleasurable cavil:  ‚ÄúNow you may
‚Ä≠  All night keep watch here, and the earliest day
‚Ä≠  Discern, being hung so high, to rouse from rest
‚Ä≠  Your dainty cattle to the Wooers‚Äô feast.
‚Ä≠  There, as befits a man of means so fair,
‚Ä≠  Soft may you sleep, nought under you but air;
‚Ä≠  And so long hang you.‚Äù  Thus they left him there,
‚Ä≠  Made fast the door, and with Ulysses were
‚Ä≠  All arm‚Äôd in th‚Äô instant.  Then they all stood close,
‚Ä≠  Their minds fire breath‚Äôd in flames against their foes,
‚Ä≠  Four in th‚Äô entry fighting all alone;
‚Ä≠  When from the hall charg‚Äôd many a mighty one.
‚Ä≠     But to them then Jove‚Äôs seed, Minerva, came,
‚Ä≠  Resembling Mentor both in voice and frame
‚Ä≠  Of manly person.  Passing well apaid
‚Ä≠  Ulysses was, and said:  ‚ÄúNow, Mentor, aid
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôGainst these odd mischiefs; call to memory now
‚Ä≠  My often good to thee, and that we two
‚Ä≠  Of one year‚Äôs life are.‚Äù  Thus he said, but thought
‚Ä≠  ft was Minerva, that had ever brought
‚Ä≠  To her side safety.  On the other part,
‚Ä≠  The Wooers threaten‚Äôd; but the chief in heart
‚Ä≠  Was Agelaus, who to Mentor spake:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúMentor!  Let no words of Ulysses make
‚Ä≠  Thy hand a fighter on his feeble side
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòGainst all us Wooers; for we firm abide
‚Ä≠  In this persuasion, that when sire and son
‚Ä≠  Our swords have slain, thy life is sure to run
‚Ä≠  One fortune with them.  What strange acts hast thou
‚Ä≠  Conceit to form here?  Thy head must bestow
‚Ä≠  The wreak of theirs on us.  And when thy pow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  Are taken down by these fierce steels of ours,
‚Ä≠  All thy possessions, in-doors and without,
‚Ä≠  Must raise on heap with his; and all thy rout
‚Ä≠  Of sons and daughters in thy turrets bleed
‚Ä≠  Wreak off‚Äôrings to us; and our town stand freed
‚Ä≠  Of all charge with thy wife.‚Äù  Minerva‚Äôs heart
‚Ä≠  Was fir‚Äôd with these braves, the approv‚Äôd desert
‚Ä≠  Of her Ulysses chiding, saying:  ‚ÄúNo more
‚Ä≠  Thy force nor fortitude as heretofore
‚Ä≠  Will gain thee glory; when nine years at Troy
‚Ä≠  White-wristed Helen‚Äôs rescue did employ
‚Ä≠  Thy arms and wisdom, still and ever us‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  The bloods of thousands through the field diffus‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By thy vast valour; Priam‚Äôs broad-way‚Äôd town
‚Ä≠  By thy grave parts was sack‚Äôd and overthrown;
‚Ä≠  And now, amongst thy people and thy goods,
‚Ä≠  Against the Wooers‚Äô base and petulant bloods
‚Ä≠  Stint‚Äôst thou thy valour?  Rather mourning here
‚Ä≠  Than manly fighting?  Come, friend, stand we near,
‚Ä≠  And note my labour, that thou may‚Äôst discern
‚Ä≠  Amongst thy foes how Mentor‚Äôs nerves will earn
‚Ä≠  All thy old bounties.‚Äù  This she spake, but stay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Her hand from giving each-way-often-sway‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Uncertain conquest to his certain use,
‚Ä≠  But still would try what self-pow‚Äôrs would produce
‚Ä≠  Both in the father and the glorious son.
‚Ä≠     Then on the wind-beam that along did ron
‚Ä≠  The smoky roof, transform‚Äôd, Minerva sat,
‚Ä≠  Like to a swallow; sometimes cuffing at
‚Ä≠  The swords and lances, rushing from her seat,
‚Ä≠  And up and down the troubl‚Äôd house did beat
‚Ä≠  Her wing at ev‚Äôry motion.  And as she
‚Ä≠  Had rous‚Äôd Ulysses; so the enemy
‚Ä≠  Damastor‚Äôs son excited, Polybus,
‚Ä≠  Amphinomus, and Demoptolemus,
‚Ä≠  Eurynomus, and Polyctorides;
‚Ä≠  For these were men that of the wooing prease
‚Ä≠  Were most egregious, and the clearly best
‚Ä≠  In strength of hand of all the desp‚Äôrate rest
‚Ä≠  That yet surviv‚Äôd, and now fought for their souls;
‚Ä≠  Which straight swift arrows sent among the fowls.
‚Ä≠  But first, Damastor‚Äôs son had more spare breath
‚Ä≠  To spend on their excitements ere his death,
‚Ä≠  And said:  That now Ulysses would forbear
‚Ä≠  His dismal hand, since Mentor‚Äôs spirit was there,
‚Ä≠  And blew vain vaunts about Ulysses‚Äô ears;
‚Ä≠  In whose trust he would cease his massacres,
‚Ä≠  Rest him, and put his friend‚Äôs huge boasts in proof;
‚Ä≠  And so was he beneath the entry‚Äôs roof
‚Ä≠  Left with Telemachus and th‚Äô other two.
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúAt whom,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúdischarge no darts, but throw
‚Ä≠  All at Ulysses, rousing his faint rest;
‚Ä≠  Whom if we slaughter, by our interest
‚Ä≠  In Jove‚Äôs assistance, all the rest may yield
‚Ä≠  Our pow‚Äôrs no care, when he strews once the field.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     As he then will‚Äôd, they all at random threw
‚Ä≠  Where they suppos‚Äôd he rested; and then flew
‚Ä≠  Minerva after ev‚Äôry dart, and made
‚Ä≠  Some strike the threshold, some the walls invade,
‚Ä≠  Some beat the doors, and all acts render‚Äôd vain
‚Ä≠  Their grave steel offer‚Äôd.  Which escap‚Äôd, again‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Came on Ulysses, saying:  ‚ÄúO that we
‚Ä≠  The Wooers‚Äô troop with our joint archery
‚Ä≠  Might so assail, that where their spirits dream
‚Ä≠  On our deaths first, we first may slaughter them!‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus the much-suff‚Äôrer said; and all let-fly,
‚Ä≠  When ev‚Äôry man struck dead his enemy.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses slaughter‚Äôd Demoptolemus.
‚Ä≠  Euryades by young Telemachus
‚Ä≠  His death encounter‚Äôd.  Good Eum√¶us slew
‚Ä≠  Elatus.  And Phil≈ìtius overthrew
‚Ä≠  Pisander.  All which tore the pav√©d floor
‚Ä≠  Up with their teeth.  The rest retir‚Äôd before
‚Ä≠  Their second charge to inner rooms; and then
‚Ä≠  Ulysses follow‚Äôd; from the slaughter‚Äôd men
‚Ä≠  Their darts first drawing.  While which work was done,
‚Ä≠  The Wooers threw with huge contention
‚Ä≠  To kill them all; when with her swallow-wing
‚Ä≠  Minerva cuff‚Äôd, and made their jav‚Äôlins ring
‚Ä≠  Against the doors and thresholds, as before.
‚Ä≠  Some yet did graze upon their marks.  One tore
‚Ä≠  The prince‚Äôs wrist, which was Amphimedon,
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô extreme part of the skin but touch‚Äôd upon.
‚Ä≠  Ctesippus over good Eumeeus‚Äô shield
‚Ä≠  His shoulder‚Äôs top did taint; which yet did yield
‚Ä≠  The lance free pass, and gave his hurt the ground.
‚Ä≠     Again then charg‚Äôd the Wooers, and girt round
‚Ä≠  Ulysses with their lances; who turn‚Äôd head,
‚Ä≠  And with his jav‚Äôlin struck Eurydamas dead.
‚Ä≠  Telemachus disliv‚Äôd Amphimedon;
‚Ä≠  Eum√¶us, Polybus; Phil≈ìtius won
‚Ä≠  Ctesippus‚Äô bosom with his dart, and said,
‚Ä≠  In quittance of the jester‚Äôs part he play‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  The neat‚Äôs foot hurling at Ulysses:  ‚ÄúNow,
‚Ä≠  Great son of Polytherses, you that vow
‚Ä≠  Your wit to bitter taunts, and love to wound
‚Ä≠  The heart of any with a jest, so crown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Your wit be with a laughter, never yielding
‚Ä≠  To fools in folly, but your glory building
‚Ä≠  On putting down in fooling, spitting forth
‚Ä≠  Puff‚Äôd words at all sorts, cease to scoff at worth,
‚Ä≠  And leave revenge of vile words to the Gods,
‚Ä≠  Since their wits bear the sharper edge by odds;
‚Ä≠  And, in the mean time, take the dart I drave,
‚Ä≠  For that right hospitable foot you gave
‚Ä≠  Divine Ulysses, begging but his own.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus spake the black-ox-herdsman; and straight down
‚Ä≠  Ulysses struck another with his dart--
‚Ä≠  Damastor‚Äôs son.  Telemachus did part,
‚Ä≠  Just in the midst, the belly of the fair
‚Ä≠  Evenor‚Äôs son; his fierce pile taking air
‚Ä≠  Out at his back.  Flat fell he on his face,
‚Ä≠  His whole brows knocking, and did mark the place.
‚Ä≠     And now man-slaught‚Äôring Pallas took in hand
‚Ä≠  Her snake-fring‚Äôd shield, and on that beam took stand
‚Ä≠  In her true form, where swallow-like she sat.
‚Ä≠  And then, in this way of the house and that,
‚Ä≠  The Wooers, wounded at the heart with fear,
‚Ä≠  Fled the encounter; as in pastures where
‚Ä≠  Fat herds of oxen feed, about the field
‚Ä≠  (As if wild madness their instincts impell‚Äôd)
‚Ä≠  The high-fed bullocks fly, whom in the spring,
‚Ä≠  When days are long, gad-bees or breezes sting.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses and his son the flyers chas‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  As when, with crooked beaks and seres, a cast
‚Ä≠  Of hill-bred eagles, cast-off at some game,
‚Ä≠  That yet their strengths keep, but, put up, in flame
‚Ä≠  The eagle stoops; from which, along the field
‚Ä≠  The poor fowls make wing, this and that way yield
‚Ä≠  Their hard-flown pinions, then the clouds assay
‚Ä≠  For ‚Äôscape or shelter, their forlorn dismay
‚Ä≠  All spirit exhaling, all wings‚Äô strength to carry
‚Ä≠  Their bodies forth, and, truss‚Äôd up, to the quarry
‚Ä≠  Their falconers ride-in, and rejoice to see
‚Ä≠  Their hawks perform a flight so fervently;
‚Ä≠  So, in their flight, Ulysses with his heir
‚Ä≠  Did stoop and cuff the Wooers, that the air
‚Ä≠  Broke in vast sighs, whose heads they shot and cleft,
‚Ä≠  The pavement boiling with the souls they reft.
‚Ä≠     Liodes, running to Ulysses, took
‚Ä≠  His knees, and thus did on his name invoke;
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúUlysses!  Let me pray thee to my place
‚Ä≠  Afford the rev‚Äôrence, and to me the grace;
‚Ä≠  That never did or said, to any dame
‚Ä≠  Thy court contain‚Äôd, or deed, or word to blame;
‚Ä≠  But others so affected I have made
‚Ä≠  I lay down their insolence; and, if the trade
‚Ä≠  They kept with wickedness have made them still
‚Ä≠  Despise my speech, and use their wonted ill,
‚Ä≠  They have their penance by the stroke of death,
‚Ä≠  Which their desert divinely warranteth.
‚Ä≠  But I am priest amongst them, and shall I
‚Ä≠  That nought have done worth death amongst them die?
‚Ä≠  From thee this proverb then will men derive:
‚Ä≠  _Good turns do never their mere deeds survive.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     He, bending his displeas√©d forehead, said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúIf you be priest among them, as you plead,
‚Ä≠  Yet you would marry, and with my wife too,
‚Ä≠  And have descent by her.  For all that woo
‚Ä≠  Wish to obtain, which they should never do,
‚Ä≠  Dames‚Äô husbands living.  You must therefore pray
‚Ä≠  Of force, and oft in Court here, that the day
‚Ä≠  Of my return for him might never shine;
‚Ä≠  The death to me wish‚Äôd, therefore, shall be thine.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he took a sword up that was cast
‚Ä≠  From Agelaus, having struck his last,
‚Ä≠  And on the priest‚Äôs mid neck he laid a stroke
‚Ä≠  That struck his head off, tumbling as he spoke.
‚Ä≠     Then did the poet Phemius (whose surname
‚Ä≠  Was call‚Äôd Terpiades; who thither came
‚Ä≠  Forc‚Äôd by the Wooers) fly death; but being near
‚Ä≠  The court‚Äôs great gate, he stood, and parted there
‚Ä≠  In two his counsels; either to remove
‚Ä≠  And take the altar of Herceian Jove
‚Ä≠  (Made sacred to him, with a world of art
‚Ä≠  Engrav‚Äôn about it, where were wont t‚Äô impart
‚Ä≠  Laertes and Ulysses many a thigh
‚Ä≠  Of broad-brow‚Äôd oxen to the Deity)
‚Ä≠  Or venture to Ulysses, clasp his knee,
‚Ä≠  And pray his ruth.  The last was the decree
‚Ä≠  His choice resolv‚Äôd on.  ‚ÄôTwixt the royal throne
‚Ä≠  And that fair table that the bowl stood on
‚Ä≠  With which they sacrific‚Äôd, his harp he laid
‚Ä≠  Along the earth, the King‚Äôs knees hugg‚Äôd, and said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúUlysses!  Let my pray‚Äôrs obtain of thee
‚Ä≠  My sacred skill‚Äôs respect, and ruth to me!
‚Ä≠  It will hereafter grieve thee to have slain
‚Ä≠  A poet, that doth sing to Gods and men.
‚Ä≠  I of myself am taught, for God alone
‚Ä≠  All sorts of song hath in my bosom sown,
‚Ä≠  And I, as to a God, will sing to thee;
‚Ä≠  Then do not thou deal like the priest with me.
‚Ä≠  Thine own lov‚Äôd son Telemachus will say,
‚Ä≠  That not to beg here, nor with willing way
‚Ä≠  Was my access to thy high court addrest,
‚Ä≠  To give the Wooers my song after feast,
‚Ä≠  But, being many, and so much more strong,
‚Ä≠  They forced me hither, and compell‚Äôd my song.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This did the prince‚Äôs sacred virtue hear,
‚Ä≠  And to the King, his father, said:  ‚ÄúForbear
‚Ä≠  To mix the guiltless with the guilty‚Äôs blood.
‚Ä≠  And with him likewise let our mercies save
‚Ä≠  Medon the herald, that did still behave
‚Ä≠  Himself with care of my good from a child;
‚Ä≠  If by Eum√¶us yet he be not kill‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Or by Phil≈ìtius, nor your fury met,
‚Ä≠  While all this blood about the house it swet.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This Medon heard, as lying hid beneath
‚Ä≠  A throne set near, half-dead with fear of death;
‚Ä≠  A new-flay‚Äôd ox-hide, as but there thrown by,
‚Ä≠  His serious shroud made, he lying there to fly.
‚Ä≠  But hearing this he quickly left the throne,
‚Ä≠  His ox-hide cast as quickly, and as soon
‚Ä≠  The prince‚Äôs knees seiz‚Äôd, saying:  ‚ÄúO my love,
‚Ä≠  I am not slain, but here alive and move.
‚Ä≠  Abstain yourself, and do not see your sire
‚Ä≠  Quench with my cold blood the unmeasur‚Äôd fire
‚Ä≠  That flames in his strength, making spoil of me,
‚Ä≠  His wrath‚Äôs right, for the Wooers‚Äô injury.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Ulysses smil‚Äôd, and said:  ‚ÄúBe confident
‚Ä≠  This man hath sav‚Äôd and made thee different,
‚Ä≠  To let thee know, and say, and others see,
‚Ä≠  _Good life is much more safe than villany._
‚Ä≠  Go then, sit free without from death within.
‚Ä≠  This much-renown√©d singer from the sin
‚Ä≠  Of these men likewise quit.  Both rest you there,
‚Ä≠  While I my house purge as it fits me here.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, they went and took their seat without
‚Ä≠  At Jove‚Äôs high altar, looking round about,
‚Ä≠  Expecting still their slaughter.  When the King
‚Ä≠  Search‚Äôd round the hall, to try life‚Äôs hidden wing
‚Ä≠  Made from more death.  But all laid prostrate there
‚Ä≠  In blood and gore he saw.  Whole shoals they were,
‚Ä≠  And lay as thick as in a hollow creek
‚Ä≠  Without the white sea, when the fishers break
‚Ä≠  Their many-mesh‚Äôd draught-net up, there lie
‚Ä≠  Fish frisking on the sands, and fain the dry
‚Ä≠  Would for the wet change, but th‚Äô all-seeing beam
‚Ä≠  The sun exhales hath suck‚Äôd their lives from them;
‚Ä≠  So one by other sprawl‚Äôd the Wooers there.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses and his son then bid appear
‚Ä≠  The nurse Euryclea, to let her hear
‚Ä≠  His mind in something fit for her affair.
‚Ä≠     He op‚Äôd the door, and call‚Äôd, and said:  ‚ÄúRepair,
‚Ä≠  Grave matron long since born, that art our spy
‚Ä≠  To all this house‚Äôs servile housewif‚Äôry;
‚Ä≠  My father calls thee, to impart some thought
‚Ä≠  That asks thy action.‚Äù  His word found in nought
‚Ä≠  Her slack observance, who straight op‚Äôd the door
‚Ä≠  And enter‚Äôd to him; when himself before
‚Ä≠  Had left the hall.  But there the King she view‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Amongst the slain, with blood and gore imbrued.
‚Ä≠  And as a lion skulking all in night,
‚Ä≠  Far-off in pastures, and come home, all dight
‚Ä≠  In jaws and breast-locks with an ox‚Äôs blood
‚Ä≠  New feasted on him, his looks full of mood;
‚Ä≠  So look‚Äôd Ulysses, all his hands and feet
‚Ä≠  Freckled with purple.  When which sight did greet
‚Ä≠  The poor old woman (such works being for eyes
‚Ä≠  Of no soft temper) out she brake in cries,
‚Ä≠  Whose vent, though throughly open‚Äôd, he yet clos‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Call‚Äôd her more near, and thus her plaints compos‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠  ‚Äú'Forbear, nor shriek thus, but vent joys as loud.
‚Ä≠  _It is no piety to bemoan the proud,_
‚Ä≠  Though ends befall them moving ne‚Äôer so much,
‚Ä≠  These are the portions of the Gods to such.
‚Ä≠  _Men‚Äôs own impieties in their instant act
‚Ä≠  Sustain their plagues, which are with stay but rackt._
‚Ä≠  But these men Gods nor men had in esteem,
‚Ä≠  Nor good nor bad had any sense in them,
‚Ä≠  Their lives directly ill were, therefore, cause
‚Ä≠  That Death in these stern forms so deeply draws.
‚Ä≠  Recount, then, to me those licentious dames
‚Ä≠  That lost my honour and their sex‚Äôs shames.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you truly,‚Äù  she replied:   ‚ÄúThere are
‚Ä≠  Twice five-and-twenty women here that share
‚Ä≠  All work amongst them; whom I taught to spin,
‚Ä≠  And bear the just bands that they suffer‚Äôd in.
‚Ä≠  Of all which only there were twelve that gave
‚Ä≠  Themselves to impudence and light behave,
‚Ä≠  Nor me respecting, nor herself--the Queen.
‚Ä≠  And for your son he hath but lately been
‚Ä≠  Of years to rule; nor would his mother bear
‚Ä≠  His empire where her women‚Äôs labours were,
‚Ä≠  But let me go and give her notice now
‚Ä≠  Of your arrival.  Sure some God doth show
‚Ä≠  His hand upon her in this rest she takes,
‚Ä≠  That all these uproars bears and never wakes.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúNor wake her yet,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúbut cause to come
‚Ä≠  Those twelve light women to this utter room.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She made all utmost haste to come and go,
‚Ä≠  And bring the women he had summon‚Äôd so.
‚Ä≠     Then both his swains and son he bade go call
‚Ä≠  The women to their aid, and clear the hall
‚Ä≠  Of those dead bodies, cleanse each board and throne
‚Ä≠  With wetted sponges.  Which with fitness done,
‚Ä≠  He bade take all the strumpets ‚Äôtwixt the wall
‚Ä≠  Of his first court and that room next the hall,
‚Ä≠  In which the vessels of the house were scour‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And in their bosoms sheath their ev‚Äôry sword,
‚Ä≠  Till all their souls were fled, and they had then
‚Ä≠  Felt ‚Äôtwas but pain to sport with lawless men.
‚Ä≠     This said, the women came all drown‚Äôd in moan,
‚Ä≠  And weeping bitterly.  But first was done
‚Ä≠  The bearing thence the dead; all which beneath
‚Ä≠  The portico they stow‚Äôd, where death on death
‚Ä≠  They heap‚Äôd together.  Then took all the pains
‚Ä≠  Ulysses will‚Äôd.  His son yet and the swains
‚Ä≠  With paring-shovels wrought.  The women bore
‚Ä≠  Their parings forth, and all the clotter‚Äôd gore.
‚Ä≠  The house then cleans‚Äôd, they brought the women out,
‚Ä≠  And put them in a room so wall‚Äôd about
‚Ä≠  That no means serv‚Äôd their sad estates to fly.
‚Ä≠  Then said Telemachus:  ‚ÄúThese shall not die
‚Ä≠  A death that lets out any wanton blood,
‚Ä≠  And vents the poison that gave lust her food,
‚Ä≠  The body cleansing, but a death that chokes
‚Ä≠  The breath, and altogether that provokes
‚Ä≠  And seems as bellows to abhorr√©d lust,
‚Ä≠  That both on my head pour‚Äôd depraves unjust,
‚Ä≠  And on my mother‚Äôs, scandalling the Court,
‚Ä≠  With men debauch‚Äôd, in so abhorr‚Äôd a sort.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, a halser of a ship they cast
‚Ä≠  About a cross-beam of the roof, which fast
‚Ä≠  They made about their necks, in twelve parts cut,
‚Ä≠  And hal‚Äôd them up so high they could not put
‚Ä≠  Their feet to any stay.  As which was done,
‚Ä≠  Look how a mavis, or a pigeon,
‚Ä≠  In any grove caught with a springe or net,
‚Ä≠  With struggling pinions ‚Äôgainst the ground doth beat
‚Ä≠  Her tender body, and that then strait bed
‚Ä≠  Is sour to that swing in which she was bred;
‚Ä≠  So striv‚Äôd these taken birds, till ev‚Äôry one
‚Ä≠  Her pliant halter had enforc‚Äôd upon
‚Ä≠  Her stubborn neck, and then aloft was haul‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To wretched death.  A little space they sprawl‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Their feet fast moving, but were quickly still.
‚Ä≠     Then fetch‚Äôd they down Melanthius, to fulfill
‚Ä≠  The equal execution; which was done
‚Ä≠  In portal of the hall, and thus begun:
‚Ä≠  They first slit both his nostrils, cropp‚Äôd each ear,
‚Ä≠  His members tugg‚Äôd off, which the dogs did tear
‚Ä≠  And chop up bleeding sweet; and, while red-hot
‚Ä≠  The vice-abhorring blood was, off they smote
‚Ä≠  His hands and feet; and there that work had end.
‚Ä≠  Then wash‚Äôd they hands and feet that blood had stain‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And took the house again.  And then the King
‚Ä≠  Euryclea calling, bade her quickly bring
‚Ä≠  All-ill-expelling brimstone, and some fire,
‚Ä≠  That with perfumes cast he might make entire
‚Ä≠  The house‚Äôs first integrity in all.
‚Ä≠  And then his timely will was, she should call
‚Ä≠  Her Queen and ladies; still yet charging her
‚Ä≠  That all the handmaids she should first confer.
‚Ä≠     She said he spake as fitted; but, before,
‚Ä≠  She held it fit to change the weeds he wore,
‚Ä≠  And she would others bring him, that not so
‚Ä≠  His fair broad shoulders might rest clad, and show
‚Ä≠  His person to his servants was to blame.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúFirst bring me fire,‚Äù  said he.  She went and came
‚Ä≠  With fire and sulphur straight; with which the hall
‚Ä≠  And of the huge house all rooms capital
‚Ä≠  He throughly sweeten‚Äôd.  Then went nurse to call
‚Ä≠  The handmaid servants down; and up she went
‚Ä≠  To tell the news, and will‚Äôd them to present
‚Ä≠  Their service to their sov‚Äôreign.  Down they came
‚Ä≠  Sustaining torches all, and pour‚Äôd a flame
‚Ä≠  Of love about their lord, with welcomes home,
‚Ä≠  With huggings of his hands, with laboursome
‚Ä≠  Both heads and foreheads kisses, and embraces,
‚Ä≠  And plied him so with all their loving graces
‚Ä≠  That tears and sighs took up his whole desire;
‚Ä≠  For now he knew their hearts to him entire.

‚Ä≠  THE END OF THE TWENTY-SECOND BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS.



‚Ä≠  THE TWENTY-THIRD BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  Ulysses to his wife is known.
‚Ä≠  A brief sum of his travels shown.
‚Ä≠  Himself, his son, and servants go
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô approve the Wooers‚Äô overthrow.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _Œ®ŒπÃë._
‚Ä≠     For all annoys
‚Ä≠        Sustain‚Äôd before,
‚Ä≠     The true wife‚Äôs joys
‚Ä≠        Now made the more.

‚Ä≠  The servants thus inform‚Äôd, the matron goes
‚Ä≠  Up where the Queen was cast in such repose,
‚Ä≠  Affected with a fervent joy to tell
‚Ä≠  What all this time she did with pain conceal.
‚Ä≠  Her knees revok‚Äôd their first strength, and her feet
‚Ä≠  Were borne above the ground with wings to greet
‚Ä≠  The long-griev‚Äôd Queen with news her King was come;
‚Ä≠  And, near her, said:  ‚ÄúWake, leave this withdrawn room,
‚Ä≠  That now your eyes may see at length, though late,
‚Ä≠  The man return‚Äôd, which, all the heavy date
‚Ä≠  Your woes have rack‚Äôd out, you have long‚Äôd to see.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses is come home, and hath set free
‚Ä≠  His court of all your Wooers, slaught‚Äôring all
‚Ä≠  For wasting so his goods with festival,
‚Ä≠  His house so vexing, and for violence done
‚Ä≠  So all ways varied to his only son.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  She answer‚Äôd her:  ‚ÄúThe Gods have made thee mad,
‚Ä≠  Of whose pow‚Äôr now thy pow‚Äôrs such proof have had.
‚Ä≠  The Gods can blind with follies wisest eyes,
‚Ä≠  And make men foolish so to make them wise.
‚Ä≠  For they have hurt ev‚Äôn thy grave brain, that bore
‚Ä≠  An understanding spirit heretofore.
‚Ä≠  Why hast thou wak‚Äôd me to more tears, when Moan
‚Ä≠  Hath turn‚Äôd my mind, with tears into her own?
‚Ä≠  Thy madness much more blameful, that with lies
‚Ä≠  Thy haste is laden, and both robs mine eyes
‚Ä≠  Of most delightsome sleep, and sleep of them,
‚Ä≠  That now had bound me in his sweet extreme,
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô embrace my lids and close my visual spheres:
‚Ä≠  I have not slept so much this twenty years,
‚Ä≠  Since first my dearest sleeping-mate was gone
‚Ä≠  For that too-ill-to-speak-of Ilion.
‚Ä≠  Hence, take your mad steps back.  If any maid
‚Ä≠  Of all my train besides a part had play‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  So bold to wake, and tell mine ears such lies,
‚Ä≠  I had return‚Äôd her to her housewif‚Äôries
‚Ä≠  With good proof of my wrath to such rude dames.
‚Ä≠  But go, your years have sav‚Äôd their younger blames.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She answer‚Äôd her:  ‚ÄúI nothing wrong your ear,
‚Ä≠  But tell the truth.  Your long-miss‚Äôd lord is here,
‚Ä≠  And, with the Wooers‚Äô slaughter, his own hand,
‚Ä≠  In chief exploit, hath to his own command
‚Ä≠  Reduc‚Äôd his house; and that poor guest was he,
‚Ä≠  That all those Wooers wrought such injury.
‚Ä≠  Telemachus had knowledge long ago
‚Ä≠  That ‚Äôtwas his father, but his wisdom so
‚Ä≠  Observ‚Äôd his counsels, to give surer end
‚Ä≠  To that great work to which they did contend.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This call‚Äôd her spirits to their conceiving places;
‚Ä≠  She sprung for joy from blames into embraces
‚Ä≠  Of her grave nurse, wip‚Äôd ev‚Äôry tear away
‚Ä≠  From her fair cheeks, and then began to say
‚Ä≠  What nurse said over thus:  ‚ÄúO nurse, can this
‚Ä≠  Be true thou say‚Äôst?  How could that hand of his
‚Ä≠  Alone destroy so many?  They would still
‚Ä≠  Troop all together.  How could he then kill
‚Ä≠  Such numbers so united?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHow,‚Äù  said she,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúI have not seen nor heard; but certainly
‚Ä≠  The deed is done.  We sat within in fear,
‚Ä≠  The doors shut on us, and from thence might hear
‚Ä≠  The sighs and groans of ev‚Äôry man he slew,
‚Ä≠  But heard nor saw more, till at length there flew
‚Ä≠  Your son‚Äôs voice to mine ear, that call‚Äôd to me,
‚Ä≠  And bade me then come forth, and then I see
‚Ä≠  Ulysses standing in the midst of all
‚Ä≠  Your slaughter‚Äôd Wooers, heap‚Äôd up, like a wall,
‚Ä≠  One on another round about his side.
‚Ä≠  It would have done you good to have descried
‚Ä≠  Your conqu‚Äôring lord all-smear‚Äôd with blood and gore
‚Ä≠  So like a lion.  Straight, then, off they bore
‚Ä≠  The slaughter‚Äôd carcasses, that now before
‚Ä≠  The fore-court gates lie, one on another pil‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  And now your victor all the hall, defil‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With stench of hot death, is perfuming round,
‚Ä≠  And with a mighty fire the hearth hath crown‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúThus, all the death remov‚Äôd, and ev‚Äôry room
‚Ä≠  Made sweet and sightly, that yourself should come
‚Ä≠  His pleasure sent me.  Come, then, take you now
‚Ä≠  Your mutual fills of comfort.  Grief on you
‚Ä≠  Hath long and many suff‚Äôrings laid; which length,
‚Ä≠  Which many suff‚Äôrings, now your virtuous strength
‚Ä≠  Of uncorrupted chasteness hath conferr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A happy end to.  He that long hath err‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Is safe arriv‚Äôd at home; his wife, his son,
‚Ä≠  Found safe and good; all ill that hath been done
‚Ä≠  On all the doers‚Äô heads, though long prolong‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  His right hath wreak‚Äôd, and in the place they wrong‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  She answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúDo not you now laugh and boast
‚Ä≠  As you had done some great act, seeing most
‚Ä≠  Into his being; for you know he won--
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn through his poor and vile condition--
‚Ä≠  A kind of prompted thought that there was plac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Some virtue in him fit to be embrac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By all the house, but most of all by me,
‚Ä≠  And by my son that was the progeny
‚Ä≠  Of both our loves.  And yet it is not he,
‚Ä≠  For all the likely proofs ye plead to me,--
‚Ä≠  Some God hath slain the Wooers in disdain
‚Ä≠  Of the abhorr√©d pride he saw so reign
‚Ä≠  In those base works they did.  No man alive,
‚Ä≠  Or good or bad, whoever did arrive
‚Ä≠  At their abodes once, ever could obtain
‚Ä≠  Regard of them; and therefore their so vain
‚Ä≠  And vile deserts have found as vile an end.
‚Ä≠  But, for Ulysses, never will extend
‚Ä≠  His wish‚Äôd return to Greece, nor he yet lives.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHow strange a Queen are you,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúthat gives
‚Ä≠  No truth your credit, that your husband, set
‚Ä≠  Close in his house at fire, can purchase yet
‚Ä≠  No faith of you, but that he still is far
‚Ä≠  From any home of his!  Your wit‚Äôs at war
‚Ä≠  With all credulity ever!  And yet now,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll name a sign shall force belief from you:
‚Ä≠  I bath‚Äôd him lately, and beheld the scar
‚Ä≠  That still remains a mark too ocular
‚Ä≠  To leave your heart yet blinded; and I then
‚Ä≠  Had run and told you, but his hand was fain
‚Ä≠  To close my lips from th‚Äô acclamation
‚Ä≠  My heart was breathing, and his wisdom won
‚Ä≠  My still retention, till he gave me leave
‚Ä≠  And charge to tell you this.  Now then receive
‚Ä≠  My life for gage of his return; which take
‚Ä≠  In any cruel fashion, if I make
‚Ä≠  All this not clear to you.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLov‚Äôd nurse,‚Äù  said she,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThough many things thou know‚Äôst, yet these things be
‚Ä≠  Veil‚Äôd in the counsels th‚Äô uncreated Gods
‚Ä≠  Have long time mask‚Äôd in; whose dark periods
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTis hard for thee to see into.  But come,
‚Ä≠  Let‚Äôs see my son, the slain, and him by whom
‚Ä≠  They had their slaughter.‚Äù  This said, down they went;
‚Ä≠  When, on the Queen‚Äôs part, divers thoughts were spent,
‚Ä≠  If, all this giv‚Äôn no faith, she still should stand
‚Ä≠  Aloof, and question more; or his hugg‚Äôd hand
‚Ä≠  And lov√©d head she should at first assay
‚Ä≠  With free-giv‚Äôn kisses.  When her doubtful way
‚Ä≠  Had pass‚Äôd the stony pavement, she took seat
‚Ä≠  Against her husband, in the opposite heat
‚Ä≠  The fire then cast upon the other wall.
‚Ä≠  Himself set by the column of the hall,
‚Ä≠  His looks cast downwards, and expected still
‚Ä≠  When her incredulous and curious will
‚Ä≠  To shun ridiculous error, and the shame
‚Ä≠  To kiss a husband that was not the same,
‚Ä≠  Would down, and win enough faith from his sight.
‚Ä≠  She silent sat, and her perplex√©d plight
‚Ä≠  Amaze encounter‚Äôd.  Sometimes she stood clear
‚Ä≠  He was her husband; sometimes the ill wear
‚Ä≠  His person had put on transform‚Äôd him so
‚Ä≠  That yet his stamp would hardly current go.
‚Ä≠     Her son, her strangeness seeing, blam‚Äôd her thus:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúMother, ungentle mother!  tyrannous!
‚Ä≠  In this too-curious modesty you show.
‚Ä≠  Why sit you from my father, nor bestow
‚Ä≠  A word on me t‚Äô enquire and clear such doubt
‚Ä≠  As may perplex you?  Found man ever out
‚Ä≠  One other such a wife that could forbear
‚Ä≠  Her lov‚Äôd lord‚Äôs welcome home, when twenty year
‚Ä≠  In infinite suff‚Äôrance he had spent apart.
‚Ä≠  _No flint so hard is as a woman‚Äôs heart.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúSon,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúamaze contains my mind,
‚Ä≠  Nor can I speak and use the common kind
‚Ä≠  Of those enquiries, nor sustain to see
‚Ä≠  With opposite looks his count‚Äônance.  If this be
‚Ä≠  My true Ulysses now return‚Äôd, there are
‚Ä≠  Tokens betwixt us of more fitness far
‚Ä≠  To give me argument he is my lord;
‚Ä≠  And my assurance of him may afford
‚Ä≠  My proofs of joy for him from all these eyes
‚Ä≠  With more decorum than obj√©ct their guise
‚Ä≠  To public notice.‚Äù  The much-suff‚Äôrer brake
‚Ä≠  In laughter out, and to his son said:  ‚ÄúTake
‚Ä≠  Your mother from the prease, that she may make
‚Ä≠  Her own proofs of me, which perhaps may give
‚Ä≠  More cause to the acknowledgments that drive
‚Ä≠  Their show thus off.  But now, because I go
‚Ä≠  So poorly clad, she takes disdain to know
‚Ä≠  So loath‚Äôd a creature for her lov√©d lord.
‚Ä≠  Let us consult, then, how we may accord
‚Ä≠  The town to our late action.  Some one slain
‚Ä≠  Hath made the all-left slaughterer of him fain
‚Ä≠  To fly his friends and country; but our swords
‚Ä≠  Have slain a city‚Äôs most supportful lords,
‚Ä≠  The chief peers of the kingdom, therefore see
‚Ä≠  You use wise means t‚Äô uphold your victory.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúSee you to that, good father,‚Äù  said the son,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúWhose counsels have the sov‚Äôreign glory won
‚Ä≠  From all men living.  None will strive with you,
‚Ä≠  But with unquestion‚Äôd girlands grace your brow,
‚Ä≠  To whom our whole alacrities we vow
‚Ä≠  In free attendance.  Nor shall our hands leave
‚Ä≠  Your onsets needy of supplies to give
‚Ä≠  All the effects that in our pow‚Äôrs can fall.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThen this,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúto me seems capital
‚Ä≠  Of all choice courses: Bathe we first, and then
‚Ä≠  Attire we freshly; all our maids and men
‚Ä≠  Enjoining likewise to their best attire.
‚Ä≠  The sacred singer then let touch his lyre,
‚Ä≠  And go before us all in graceful dance,
‚Ä≠  That all without, to whose ears shall advance
‚Ä≠  Our cheerful accents, or of travellers by,
‚Ä≠  Or firm inhabitants, solemnity
‚Ä≠  Of frolic nuptials may imagine here.
‚Ä≠  And this perform we, lest the massacre
‚Ä≠  Of all our Wooers be divulg‚Äôd about
‚Ä≠  The ample city, ere ourselves get out
‚Ä≠  And greet my father in his grove of trees,
‚Ä≠  Where, after, we will prove what policies
‚Ä≠  Olympius shall suggest to overcome
‚Ä≠  Our latest toils, and crown our welcome home.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This all obey‚Äôd; bath‚Äôd, put on fresh attire
‚Ä≠  Both men and women did.  Then took his lyre
‚Ä≠  The holy singer, and set thirst on fire
‚Ä≠  With songs and faultless dances; all the court
‚Ä≠  Rung with the footings that the numerous sport
‚Ä≠  From jocund men drew and fair-girdled dames;
‚Ä≠  Which heard abroad, thus flew the common fames:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúThis sure the day is when the much-woo‚Äôd Queen
‚Ä≠  Is richly wed.  O wretch!  That hath not been
‚Ä≠  So constant as to keep her ample house
‚Ä≠  Till th‚Äô utmost hour had brought her foremost spouse.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus some conceiv‚Äôd, but little knew the thing.
‚Ä≠  And now Eurynom√© had bath‚Äôd the King,
‚Ä≠  Smooth‚Äôd him with oils, and he himself attir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In vestures royal.  Her part then inspir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The Goddess Pallas, deck‚Äôd his head and face
‚Ä≠  With infinite beauties, gave a goodly grace
‚Ä≠  Of stature to him, a much plumper plight
‚Ä≠  Through all his body breath‚Äôd, curls soft and bright
‚Ä≠  Adorn‚Äôd his head withal, and made it show
‚Ä≠  As if the flow‚Äôry hyacinth did grow
‚Ä≠  In all his pride there, in the gen‚Äôral trim
‚Ä≠  Of ev‚Äôry lock and ev‚Äôry curious limb.
‚Ä≠  Look how a skilful artizan, well-seen
‚Ä≠  In all arts metalline, as having been
‚Ä≠  Taught by Minerva and the God of fire,
‚Ä≠  Doth gold with silver mix so that entire
‚Ä≠  They keep their self-distinction, and yet so
‚Ä≠  That to the silver from the gold doth flow
‚Ä≠  A much more artificial lustre than his own,
‚Ä≠  And thereby to the gold itself is grown
‚Ä≠  A greater glory than if wrought alone,
‚Ä≠  Both being stuck off by either‚Äôs mixtion;
‚Ä≠  So did Minerva her‚Äôs and his combine,
‚Ä≠  He more in her, she more in him, did shine.
‚Ä≠  Like an Immortal from the bath he rose,
‚Ä≠  And to his wife did all his grace dispose,
‚Ä≠  Encount‚Äôring this her strangeness:  ‚ÄúCruel dame
‚Ä≠  Of all that breathe, the Gods past steel and flame
‚Ä≠  Have made thee ruthless.  Life retains not one
‚Ä≠  Of all dames else that bears so overgrown
‚Ä≠  A mind with abstinence, as twenty years
‚Ä≠  To miss her husband drown‚Äôd in woes and tears,
‚Ä≠  And at his coming keep aloof, and fare
‚Ä≠  As of his so long absence and his care
‚Ä≠  No sense had seiz‚Äôd her.  Go, nurse, make a bed,
‚Ä≠  That I alone may sleep; her heart is dead
‚Ä≠  To all reflection!‚Äù  To him thus replied
‚Ä≠  The wise Penelope:  ‚ÄúMan half-deified,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTis not my fashion to be taken straight
‚Ä≠  With bravest men, nor poorest use to sleight.
‚Ä≠  Your mean appearance made not me retire,
‚Ä≠  Nor this your rich show makes me now admire,
‚Ä≠  Nor moves at all; for what is all to me
‚Ä≠  If not my husband?  All his certainty
‚Ä≠  I knew at parting; but, so long apart,
‚Ä≠  The outward likeness holds no full desert
‚Ä≠  For me to trust to.  Go, nurse, see addrest
‚Ä≠  A soft bed for him, and the single rest
‚Ä≠  Himself affects so.  Let it be the bed
‚Ä≠  That stands within our bridal chamber-sted,
‚Ä≠  Which he himself made.  Bring it forth from thence,
‚Ä≠  And see it furnish‚Äôd with magnificence.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said she to assay him, and did stir
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn his establish‚Äôd patience; and to her
‚Ä≠  Whom thus he answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúWoman!  your words prove
‚Ä≠  My patience strangely.  Who is it can move
‚Ä≠  My bed out of his place?  It shall oppress
‚Ä≠  Earth‚Äôs greatest understander; and, unless
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn God himself come, that can eas‚Äôly grace
‚Ä≠  Men in their most skills, it shall hold his place;
‚Ä≠  For man he lives not that (as not most skill‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  So not most young) shall easily make it yield,
‚Ä≠  If, building on the strength in which he flows,
‚Ä≠  He adds both levers too and iron crows:
‚Ä≠  For in the fixture of the bed is shown
‚Ä≠  A master-piece, a wonder; and ‚Äôtwas done
‚Ä≠  By me, and none but me, and thus was wrought:
‚Ä≠  There was an olive-tree that had his grought
‚Ä≠  Amidst a hedge, and was of shadow proud,
‚Ä≠  Fresh, and the prime age of his verdure show‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  His leaves and arms so thick that to the eye
‚Ä≠  It show‚Äôd a column for solidity.
‚Ä≠  To this had I a comprehension
‚Ä≠  To build my bridal bow‚Äôr; which all of stone,
‚Ä≠  Thick as the tree of leaves, I rais‚Äôd, and cast
‚Ä≠  A roof about it nothing meanly grac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Put glued doors to it, that op‚Äôd art enough,
‚Ä≠  Then from the olive ev‚Äôry broad-leav‚Äôd bough
‚Ä≠  I lopp‚Äôd away; then fell‚Äôd the tree; and then
‚Ä≠  Went over it both with my axe and plane,
‚Ä≠  Both govern‚Äôd by my line, And then I hew‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  My curious bedstead out; in which I shew‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Work of no common hand.  All this begun,
‚Ä≠  I could not leave till to perfection
‚Ä≠  My pains had brought it; took my wimble, bor‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The holes, as fitted, and did last afford
‚Ä≠  The varied ornament, which show‚Äôd no want
‚Ä≠  Of silver, gold, and polish‚Äôd elephant.
‚Ä≠  An ox-hide dyed in purple then I threw
‚Ä≠  Above the cords.  And thus to curious view
‚Ä≠  I hope I have objected honest sign
‚Ä≠  To prove I author nought that is not mine.
‚Ä≠  But if my bed stand unremov‚Äôd or no,
‚Ä≠  O woman, passeth human wit to know.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This sunk her knees and heart, to hear so true
‚Ä≠  The signs she urg‚Äôd; and first did tears ensue
‚Ä≠  Her rapt assurance; then she ran and spread
‚Ä≠  Her arms about his neck, kiss‚Äôd oft his head,
‚Ä≠  And thus the curious stay she made excus‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúUlysses!  Be not angry that I us‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Such strange delays to this, since heretofore
‚Ä≠  Your suff‚Äôring wisdom hath the garland wore
‚Ä≠  From all that breathe; and ‚Äôtis the Gods that, thus
‚Ä≠  With mutual miss so long afflicting us,
‚Ä≠  Have caus‚Äôd my coyness; to our youths envied
‚Ä≠  That wish‚Äôd society that should have tied
‚Ä≠  Our youths and years together; and since now
‚Ä≠  Judgment and Duty should our age allow
‚Ä≠  As full joys therein as in youth and blood,
‚Ä≠  See all young anger and reproof withstood
‚Ä≠  For not at first sight giving up my arms,
‚Ä≠  My heart still trembling lest the false alarms
‚Ä≠  That words oft strike-up should ridiculize me.
‚Ä≠  Had Argive Helen known credulity
‚Ä≠  Would bring such plagues with it, and her again,
‚Ä≠  As authoress of them all, with that foul stain
‚Ä≠  To her and to her country, she had stay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Her love and mixture from a stranger‚Äôs bed;
‚Ä≠  But God impell‚Äôd her to a shameless deed,
‚Ä≠  Because she had not in herself decreed,
‚Ä≠  Before th‚Äô attempt, that such acts still were shent
‚Ä≠  As simply in themselves as in th‚Äô event
‚Ä≠  By which not only she herself sustains,
‚Ä≠  But we, for her fault, have paid mutual pains.
‚Ä≠  Yet now, since these signs of our certain bed
‚Ä≠  You have discover‚Äôd, and distinguish√©d
‚Ä≠  From all earth‚Äôs others, no one man but you
‚Ä≠  Yet ever getting of it th‚Äô only show,
‚Ä≠  Nor one of all dames but myself and she
‚Ä≠  My father gave, old Actor‚Äôs progeny,
‚Ä≠  Who ever guarded to ourselves the door
‚Ä≠  Of that thick-shaded chamber, I no more
‚Ä≠  Will cross your clear persuasion, though till now
‚Ä≠  I stood too doubtful and austere to you,‚Äù
‚Ä≠     These words of hers, so justifying her stay,
‚Ä≠  Did more desire of joyful moan convey
‚Ä≠  To his glad mind than if at instant sight
‚Ä≠  She had allow‚Äôd him all his wishes‚Äô right.
‚Ä≠  He wept for joy, t‚Äô enjoy a wife so fit
‚Ä≠  For his grave mind, that knew his depth of wit,
‚Ä≠  And held chaste virtue at a price so high,
‚Ä≠  And as sad men at sea when shore is nigh,
‚Ä≠  Which long their hearts have wish‚Äôd, their ship quite lost
‚Ä≠  By Neptune‚Äôs rigour, and they vex‚Äôd and tost
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTwixt winds and black waves, swimming for their lives,
‚Ä≠  A few escap‚Äôd, and that few that survives,
‚Ä≠  All drench‚Äôd in foam and brine, crawl up to land,
‚Ä≠  With joy as much as they did worlds command;
‚Ä≠  So dear to this wife was her husband‚Äôs sight,
‚Ä≠  Who still embrac‚Äôd his neck, and had, till light
‚Ä≠  Display‚Äôd her silver ensign, if the Dame,
‚Ä≠  That bears the blue sky intermix‚Äôd with flame
‚Ä≠  In her fair eyes, had not infix‚Äôd her thought
‚Ä≠  On other joys, for loves so hardly brought
‚Ä≠  To long‚Äôd-for meeting; who th‚Äô extended night
‚Ä≠  Withheld in long date, nor would let the light
‚Ä≠  Her wing-hoov‚Äôd horse join--Lampus, Phaeton--
‚Ä≠  Those ever-colts that bring the morning on
‚Ä≠  To worldly men, but, in her golden chair,
‚Ä≠  Down to the ocean by her silver hair
‚Ä≠  Bound her aspirings.  Then Ulysses said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúO wife!  Nor yet are my contentions stay‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  A most unmeasur‚Äôd labour long and hard
‚Ä≠  Asks more performance; to it being prepar‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By grave Tiresi√°s, when down to hell
‚Ä≠  I made dark passage, that his skill might tell
‚Ä≠  My men‚Äôs return and mine.  But come, and now
‚Ä≠  Enjoy the sweet rest that our Fates allow.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúThe place of rest is ready,‚Äù  she replied,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúYour will at full serve, since the Deified
‚Ä≠  Have brought you where your right is to command.
‚Ä≠  But since you know, God making understand
‚Ä≠  Your searching mind, inform me what must be
‚Ä≠  Your last set labour; since ‚Äôtwill fall to me,
‚Ä≠  I hope, to hear it after, tell me now.
‚Ä≠  _The greatest pleasure is before to know.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúUnhappy!‚Äù  said Ulysses;  ‚ÄúTo what end
‚Ä≠  Importune you this labour?  It will lend
‚Ä≠  Nor you nor me delight, but you shall know
‚Ä≠  I was commanded yet more to bestow
‚Ä≠  My years in travel, many cities more
‚Ä≠  By sea to visit; and when first for shore
‚Ä≠  I left my shipping, I was will‚Äôd to take
‚Ä≠  A naval oar in hand, and with it make
‚Ä≠  My passage forth till such strange men I met
‚Ä≠  As knew no sea, nor ever salt did eat
‚Ä≠  With any victuals, who the purple beaks
‚Ä≠  Of ships did never see, nor that which breaks
‚Ä≠  The waves in curls, which is a fan-like oar,
‚Ä≠  And serves as wings with which a ship doth soar.
‚Ä≠  To let me know, then, when I was arriv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  On that strange earth where such a people liv‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  He gave me this for an unfailing sign:
‚Ä≠  When any one that took that oar of mine,
‚Ä≠  Borne on my shoulder, for a corn-cleanse fan,
‚Ä≠  I met ashore, and show‚Äôd to be a man
‚Ä≠  Of that land‚Äôs labour, there had I command
‚Ä≠  To fix mine oar, and offer on that strand
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô imperial Neptune, whom I must implore,
‚Ä≠  A lamb, a bull, and sow-ascending boar;
‚Ä≠  And then turn home, where all the other Gods
‚Ä≠  That in the broad heav‚Äôn made secure abodes
‚Ä≠  I must solicit--all my curious heed
‚Ä≠  Giv‚Äôn to the sev‚Äôral rites they have decreed--
‚Ä≠  With holy hecatombs; and then, at home,
‚Ä≠  A gentle death should seize me that would come
‚Ä≠  From out the sea, and take me to his rest
‚Ä≠  In full ripe age, about me living blest
‚Ä≠  My loving people; to which, he presag‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  The sequel of my fortunes were engag‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúIf then,‚Äù  said she,  ‚Äúthe Gods will please t‚Äô impose
‚Ä≠  A happier being to your fortune‚Äôs close
‚Ä≠  Than went before, your hope gives comfort strength
‚Ä≠  That life shall lend you better days at length.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     While this discourse spent mutual speech, the bed
‚Ä≠  Eurynom√© and nurse had made, and spread
‚Ä≠  With richest furniture, while torches spent
‚Ä≠  Their parcel-gilt thereon.  To bed then went
‚Ä≠  The aged nurse; and, where their sov‚Äôreigns were,
‚Ä≠  Eurynom√©, the chambermaid, did bear
‚Ä≠  A torch, and went before them to their rest;
‚Ä≠  To which she left them and for her‚Äôs addrest.
‚Ä≠  The King and Queen then now, as newly-wed,
‚Ä≠  Resum‚Äôd the old laws of th‚Äô embracing bed.
‚Ä≠     Telemachus and both his herdsmen then
‚Ä≠  Dissolv‚Äôd the dances both to maids and men;
‚Ä≠  Who in their shady roofs took timely sleep.
‚Ä≠  The bride and bridegroom having ceas‚Äôd to keep
‚Ä≠  Observ√©d love-joys, from their fit delight
‚Ä≠  They turn‚Äôd to talk.  The Queen then did recite
‚Ä≠  What she had suffer‚Äôd by the hateful rout
‚Ä≠  Of harmful Wooers, who had eat her out
‚Ä≠  So many oxen and so many sheep,
‚Ä≠  How many tun of wine their drinking deep
‚Ä≠  Had quite exhausted.  Great Ulysses then
‚Ä≠  Whatever slaughters he had made of men,
‚Ä≠  Whatever sorrows he himself sustain‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Repeated amply; and her ears remain‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With all delight attentive to their end,
‚Ä≠  Nor would one wink sleep till he told her all,
‚Ä≠  Beginning where he gave the Cicons fall;
‚Ä≠  From thence his pass to the Lotophagi;
‚Ä≠  The Cyclop‚Äôs acts, the putting out his eye,
‚Ä≠  And wreak of all the soldiers he had eat,
‚Ä≠  No least ruth shown to all they could entreat;
‚Ä≠  His way to √Üolus; his prompt receit
‚Ä≠  And kind dismission; his enforc‚Äôd retreat
‚Ä≠  By sudden tempest to the fishy main,
‚Ä≠  And quite distraction from his course again;
‚Ä≠  His landing at the L√¶strigonian port,
‚Ä≠  Where ships and men in miserable sort
‚Ä≠  Met all their spoils, his ship and he alone
‚Ä≠  Got off from the abhorr‚Äôd confusi√≥n;
‚Ä≠  His pass to Circe, her deceits and arts;
‚Ä≠  His thence descension to th‚Äô Infernal parts;
‚Ä≠  His life‚Äôs course of the Theban prophet learn‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Where all the slaughter‚Äôd Grecians he discern‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And lov√©d mother; his astonish‚Äôd ear
‚Ä≠  With what the Siren‚Äôs voices made him hear;
‚Ä≠  His ‚Äôscape from th‚Äô erring rocks, which Scylla was,
‚Ä≠  And rough Charybdis, with the dang‚Äôrous pass
‚Ä≠  Of all that touch‚Äôd there; his Sicilian
‚Ä≠  Offence giv‚Äôn to the Sun; his ev‚Äôry man
‚Ä≠  Destroy‚Äôd by thunder vollied out of heav‚Äôn,
‚Ä≠  That split his ship; his own endeavours driv‚Äôn
‚Ä≠  To shift for succours on th‚Äô Ogygian shore,
‚Ä≠  Where Nymph Calypso such affection bore
‚Ä≠  To him in his arrival, that with feast
‚Ä≠  She kept him in her caves, and would have blest
‚Ä≠  His welcome life with an immortal state
‚Ä≠  Would he have stay‚Äôd and liv‚Äôd her nuptial mate,
‚Ä≠  All which she never could persuade him to;
‚Ä≠  His pass to the Ph√¶acians spent in woe;
‚Ä≠  Their hearty welcome of him, as he were
‚Ä≠  A God descended from the starry sphere;
‚Ä≠  Their kind dismission of him home with gold,
‚Ä≠  Brass, garments, all things his occasions would.
‚Ä≠     This last word us‚Äôd, sleep seiz‚Äôd his weary eye
‚Ä≠  That salves all care to all mortality.
‚Ä≠     In mean space Pallas entertain‚Äôd intent
‚Ä≠  That when Ulysses thought enough time spent
‚Ä≠  In love-joys with his wife, to raise the day,
‚Ä≠  And make his grave occasions call away.
‚Ä≠  The morning rose and he, when thus he said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúO Queen, now satiate with afflictions laid
‚Ä≠  On both our bosoms,--you oppress√©d here
‚Ä≠  With cares for my return, I ev‚Äôrywhere
‚Ä≠  By Jove and all the other Deities tost
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn till all hope of my return was lost,--
‚Ä≠  And both arriv‚Äôd at this sweet haven, our bed,
‚Ä≠  Be your care us‚Äôd to see administ‚Äôred
‚Ä≠  My house-possessions left.  Those sheep, that were
‚Ä≠  Consum‚Äôd in surfeits by your Wooers here,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll forage to supply with some; and more
‚Ä≠  The suff‚Äôring Grecians shall be made restore,
‚Ä≠  Ev‚Äôn till our stalls receive their wonted fill.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAnd now, to comfort my good father‚Äôs ill
‚Ä≠  Long suffer‚Äôd for me, to the many-tree‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  And ample vineyard grounds it is decreed
‚Ä≠  In my next care that I must haste and see
‚Ä≠  His long‚Äôd-for presence.  In the mean time, be
‚Ä≠  Your wisdom us‚Äôd, that since, the sun ascended,
‚Ä≠  The fame will soon be through the town extended
‚Ä≠  Of those I here have slain, yourself, got close
‚Ä≠  Up to your chamber, see you there repose,
‚Ä≠  Cheer‚Äôd with your women, and nor look afford
‚Ä≠  Without your court, nor any man a word.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he arm‚Äôd; to arms both son and swain
‚Ä≠  His pow‚Äôr commanding, who did entertain
‚Ä≠  His charge with spirit, op‚Äôd the gates and out,
‚Ä≠  He leading all.  And now was hurl‚Äôd about
‚Ä≠  Aurora‚Äôs ruddy fire; through all whose light
‚Ä≠  Minerva led them through the town from sight.

‚Ä≠  THE END OF THE TWENTY-THIRD BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS.



‚Ä≠  THE TWENTY-FOURTH BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS

‚Ä≠  THE ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  By Mercury the Wooers‚Äô souls
‚Ä≠  Are usher‚Äôd to th‚Äô infernal pools.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses with Laertes met,
‚Ä≠  The people are in uproar set
‚Ä≠  Against them, for the Wooers‚Äô ends;
‚Ä≠  Whom Pallas stays and renders friends.

‚Ä≠  ANOTHER ARGUMENT

‚Ä≠  _Œ©._
‚Ä≠     The uproar‚Äôs fire,
‚Ä≠        The people‚Äôs fall:
‚Ä≠     The grandsire, sire,
‚Ä≠        And son, to all.

‚Ä≠  Cyllenian Hermes, with his golden rod,
‚Ä≠  The Wooers‚Äô souls, that yet retain‚Äôd abode
‚Ä≠  Amidst their bodies, call‚Äôd in dreadful rout
‚Ä≠  Forth to th‚Äô Infernals; who came murmuring out.
‚Ä≠  And as amidst the desolate retreat
‚Ä≠  Of some vast cavern, made the sacred seat
‚Ä≠  Of austere spirits, bats with breasts and wings
‚Ä≠  Clasp fast the walls, and each to other clings,
‚Ä≠  But, swept off from their coverts, up they rise
‚Ä≠  And fly with murmurs in amazeful guise
‚Ä≠  About the cavern; so these, grumbling, rose
‚Ä≠  And flock‚Äôd together.  Down before them goes
‚Ä≠  None-hurting Mercury to Hell‚Äôs broad ways,
‚Ä≠  And straight to those straits; where the ocean stays
‚Ä≠  His lofty current in calm deeps, they flew,
‚Ä≠  Then to the snowy rock they next withdrew,
‚Ä≠  And to the close of Ph≈ìbus‚Äô orient gates,
‚Ä≠  The nation then of dreams, and then the states
‚Ä≠  Of those souls‚Äô idols that the weary dead
‚Ä≠  Gave up in earth, which in a flow‚Äôry mead
‚Ä≠  Had habitable situati√≥n.
‚Ä≠  And there they saw the soul of Thetis‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  Of good Patroclus, brave Antilochus,
‚Ä≠  And Ajax, the supremely strenuous
‚Ä≠  Of all the Greek host next Pel√´ion;
‚Ä≠  All which assembled about Maia‚Äôs son.
‚Ä≠  And to them, after, came the mournful ghost
‚Ä≠  Of Agamemnon, with all those he lost
‚Ä≠  In false √Ügisthus‚Äô court.  Achilles then
‚Ä≠  Beholding there that mighty king of men,
‚Ä≠  Deplor‚Äôd his plight, and said:  ‚ÄúO Atreus‚Äô son!
‚Ä≠  Of all hero√´s, all opinion
‚Ä≠  Gave thee for Jove‚Äôs most lov‚Äôd, since most command
‚Ä≠  Of all the Greeks he gave thy eminent hand
‚Ä≠  At siege of Ilion, where we suffer‚Äôd so.
‚Ä≠  And is the issue this, that first in woe
‚Ä≠  Stern Fate did therefore set thy sequel down?
‚Ä≠  _None borne past others‚Äô Fates can pass his own._
‚Ä≠  I wish to heav‚Äôn that in the height of all
‚Ä≠  Our pomp at Ilion Fate had sign‚Äôd thy fall,
‚Ä≠  That all the Greeks might have advanc‚Äôd to thee
‚Ä≠  A famous sepulchre, and Fame might see
‚Ä≠  Thy son giv‚Äôn honour in thy honour‚Äôd end!
‚Ä≠  But now a wretched death did Fate extend
‚Ä≠  To thy confusion and thy issue‚Äôs shame.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO Thetis‚Äô son,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúthe vital flame
‚Ä≠  Extinct at Ilion, far from th‚Äô Argive fields,
‚Ä≠  The style of  Blessed to thy virtue yields.
‚Ä≠  About thy fall the best of Greece and Troy
‚Ä≠  Were sacrific‚Äôd to slaughter.  Thy just joy
‚Ä≠  Conceiv‚Äôd in battle with some worth forgot
‚Ä≠  In such a death as great Apollo shot
‚Ä≠  At thy encounters.  Thy brave person lay
‚Ä≠  Hid in a dusty whirlwind, that made way
‚Ä≠  With human breaths spent in thy ruin‚Äôs state
‚Ä≠  Thou, great, wert greatly valued in thy fate.
‚Ä≠  All day we fought about thee; nor at all
‚Ä≠  Had ceas‚Äôd our conflict, had not Jove let fall
‚Ä≠  A storm that forc‚Äôd off our unwilling feet.
‚Ä≠  But, having brought thee from the fight to fleet,
‚Ä≠  Thy glorious person, bath‚Äôd and balm‚Äôd, we laid
‚Ä≠  Aloft a bed; and round about thee paid
‚Ä≠  The Greeks warm tears to thy deplor‚Äôd decease,
‚Ä≠  Quite daunted, cutting all their curls‚Äô increase.
‚Ä≠  Thy death drave a divine voice through the seas
‚Ä≠  That started up thy mother from the waves;
‚Ä≠  And all the m√°rine Godheads left their caves,
‚Ä≠  Consorting to our fleet her rapt repair.
‚Ä≠  The Greeks stood frighted to see sea and air
‚Ä≠  And earth combine so in thy loss‚Äôs sense,
‚Ä≠  Had taken ship and fled for ever thence,
‚Ä≠  If old much-knowing-Nestor had not stay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Their rushing off; his counsels having sway‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In all times former with such cause their courses;
‚Ä≠  Who bade contain themselves, and trust their forces,
‚Ä≠  For all they saw was Thetis come from sea,
‚Ä≠  With others of the wat‚Äôry progeny,
‚Ä≠  To see and mourn for her deceas√©d son.
‚Ä≠  Which stay‚Äôd the fears that all to flight had won;
‚Ä≠  And round about thee stood th‚Äô old sea-God‚Äôs Seeds
‚Ä≠  Wretchedly mourning, their immortal weeds
‚Ä≠  Spreading upon thee.  All the sacred Nine
‚Ä≠  Of deathless Muses paid thee dues divine,
‚Ä≠  By varied turns their heav‚Äônly voices venting,
‚Ä≠  All in deep passion for thy death consenting.
‚Ä≠  And then of all our army not an eye
‚Ä≠  You could have seen undrown‚Äôd in misery,
‚Ä≠  The moving Muse so rul‚Äôd in ev‚Äôry mind.
‚Ä≠  Full seventeen days and nights our tears confin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To celebration of thy mourn√©d end;
‚Ä≠  Both men and Gods did in thy moan contend.
‚Ä≠  The eighteenth day we spent about thy heap
‚Ä≠  Of dying fire.  Black oxen, fattest sheep
‚Ä≠  We slew past number.  Then the precious spoil,
‚Ä≠  Thy corse, we took up, which with floods of oil
‚Ä≠  And pleasant honey we embalm‚Äôd, and then
‚Ä≠  Wrapp‚Äôd thee in those robes that the Gods did rain.
‚Ä≠  In which we gave thee to the hallow‚Äôd flame;
‚Ä≠  To which a number of heroical name,
‚Ä≠  As prest to sacrifice their vital right
‚Ä≠  To thy dead ruins while so bright they burn‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Both foot and horse brake in, and fought and mourn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In infinite tumult.  But when all the night
‚Ä≠  The rich flame lasted, and that wasted quite
‚Ä≠  Thy body was with the enamour‚Äôd fire:
‚Ä≠  We came in early morn, and an entire
‚Ä≠  Collection made of ev‚Äôry ivory bone;
‚Ä≠  Which wash‚Äôd in wine, and giv‚Äôn fit uncti√≥n,
‚Ä≠  A two-ear‚Äôd bowl of gold thy mother gave,
‚Ä≠  By Bacchus giv‚Äôn her and did form receive
‚Ä≠  From Vulcan‚Äôs famous hand, which, O renown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Great Thetis‚Äô son, with thy fair bones we crown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Mix‚Äôd with the bones of Men≈ìtiades
‚Ä≠  And brave Antilochus; who, in decease
‚Ä≠  Of thy Patroclus, was thy favour‚Äôs dear.
‚Ä≠  About thee then a matchless sepulchre
‚Ä≠  The sacred host of the Achaians rais‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Upon the Hellespont, where most it seiz‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  For height and conspicuity, the eyes
‚Ä≠  Of living men and their posterities.
‚Ä≠  Thy mother then obtain‚Äôd the Gods‚Äô consent
‚Ä≠  To institute an honour‚Äôd game, that spent
‚Ä≠  The best approvement of our Grecian fames.
‚Ä≠  In whose praise I must say that many games
‚Ä≠  About hero√´s‚Äô sepulchres mine eyes
‚Ä≠  Have seen perform‚Äôd, but these bore off the prize
‚Ä≠  With miracles to me from all before.
‚Ä≠  In which thy silver-footed mother bore
‚Ä≠  The institution‚Äôs name, but thy deserts,
‚Ä≠  Being great with heav‚Äôn, caus‚Äôd all the eminent parts.
‚Ä≠  And thus, through all the worst effects of Fate,
‚Ä≠  Achilles‚Äô fame ev‚Äôn Death shall propagate.
‚Ä≠  While anyone shall lend the light an eye
‚Ä≠  Divine √Üacides shall never die.
‚Ä≠  But wherein can these comforts be conceiv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  As rights to me?  When, having quite achiev‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  An end with safety, and with conquest, too,
‚Ä≠  Of so unmatch‚Äôd a war, what none could do
‚Ä≠  Of all our enemies there, at home a friend
‚Ä≠  And wife have giv‚Äôn me inglorious end?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     While these thus spake, the Argus-killing spy
‚Ä≠  Brought-near Ulysses‚Äô noble victory
‚Ä≠  To their renew‚Äôd discourse, in all the ends
‚Ä≠  The Wooers‚Äô suffer‚Äôd, and show‚Äôd those his friends;
‚Ä≠  Whom now amaze invaded with the view
‚Ä≠  And made give back; yet Agamemnon knew
‚Ä≠  Melanthius‚Äô heir, much-fam‚Äôd Amphimedon,
‚Ä≠  Who had in Ithaca guest-favours shown
‚Ä≠  To great Atrides; who first spake, and said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAmphimedon!  What suff‚Äôrance hath been laid
‚Ä≠  On your alive parts that hath made you make
‚Ä≠  This land of darkness the retreat you take,
‚Ä≠  So all together, all being like in years,
‚Ä≠  Nor would a man have choos‚Äôd, of all the peers
‚Ä≠  A city honours, men to make a part
‚Ä≠  More strong for any object?  Hath your smart
‚Ä≠  Been felt from Neptune, being at sea--his wrath
‚Ä≠  The winds and waves exciting to your scathe?
‚Ä≠  Or have offensive men impos‚Äôd this fate--
‚Ä≠  Your oxen driving, or your flock‚Äôs estate?
‚Ä≠  Or for your city fighting and your wives,
‚Ä≠  Have deaths untimely seiz‚Äôd your best-tim‚Äôd lives?
‚Ä≠  Inform me truly.  I was once your guest,
‚Ä≠  When I and Menelaus had profest
‚Ä≠  First arms for Ilion, and were come ashore
‚Ä≠  On Ithaca, with purpose to implore
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô aid, that city-racing man,
‚Ä≠  In wreak of the adult‚Äôrous Phrygian.
‚Ä≠  Retain not you the time?  A whole month‚Äôs date
‚Ä≠  We spent at sea, in hope to instigate
‚Ä≠  In our arrival old Laertes‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  Whom, hardly yet, to our design we won.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The soul made answer:  ‚ÄúWorthiest king of men,
‚Ä≠  I well remember ev‚Äôry passage then
‚Ä≠  You now reduce to thought, and will relate
‚Ä≠  The truth in whole form of our timeless fate:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúWe woo‚Äôd the wife of that long-absent king,
‚Ä≠  Who (though her second marriage were a thing
‚Ä≠  Of most hate to her) she would yet deny
‚Ä≠  At no part our affections, nor comply
‚Ä≠  With any in performance, but decreed,
‚Ä≠  In her delays, the cruel Fates we feed.
‚Ä≠  Her craft was this: She undertook to weave
‚Ä≠  A funeral garment destin‚Äôd to receive
‚Ä≠  The corse of old Laertes; being a task
‚Ä≠  Of infinite labour, and which time would ask.
‚Ä≠  In midst of whose attempt she caus‚Äôd our stay
‚Ä≠  With this attraction: ‚ÄòYouths, that come in way
‚Ä≠  Of honour‚Äôd nuptials to me, though my lord
‚Ä≠  Abide amongst the dead, yet cease to board
‚Ä≠  My choice for present nuptials, and sustain,
‚Ä≠  Lest what is past me of this web be vain,
‚Ä≠  Till all receive perfection.  ‚ÄôTis a weed
‚Ä≠  Dispos‚Äôd to wrap in at his funeral need
‚Ä≠  The old Laertes; who, possessing much,
‚Ä≠  Would, in his want of rites as fitting, touch
‚Ä≠  My honour highly with each vulgar dame.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  Thus spake she, and persuaded; and her frame
‚Ä≠  All-day she labour‚Äôd, her day‚Äôs work not small,
‚Ä≠  But ev‚Äôry night-time she unwrought it all.
‚Ä≠  Three years continuing this imperfect task;
‚Ä≠  But when the fourth year came her sleights could mask
‚Ä≠  In no more covert, since her trusted maid
‚Ä≠  Her whole deceit to our true note betray‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  With which surpriz‚Äôd, she could no more protract
‚Ä≠  Her work‚Äôs perfection, but gave end exact
‚Ä≠  To what remain‚Äôd, wash‚Äôd-up, and set thereon
‚Ä≠  A gloss so bright that like the sun and moon
‚Ä≠  The whole work show‚Äôd together.  And when now
‚Ä≠  Of mere necessity her honour‚Äôd vow
‚Ä≠  She must make good to us, ill-fortune brought
‚Ä≠  Ulysses home, who yet gave none one thought
‚Ä≠  Of his arrival, but far-off at field
‚Ä≠  Liv‚Äôd with his herdsman, nor his trust would yield
‚Ä≠  Note of his person, but liv‚Äôd there as guest,
‚Ä≠  Ragg‚Äôd as a beggar in that life profest.
‚Ä≠  At length Telemachus left Pylos‚Äô sand,
‚Ä≠  And with a ship fetch‚Äôd soon his native land,
‚Ä≠  When yet not home he went, but laid his way
‚Ä≠  Up to his herdsman where his father lay;
‚Ä≠  And where both laid our deaths.  To town then bore
‚Ä≠  The swine-herd and his King, the swain before,
‚Ä≠  Telemachus in other ways bestow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His course home first, t‚Äô associate us that woo‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  The swain the King led after, who came on
‚Ä≠  Ragg√©d and wretched, and still lean‚Äôd upon
‚Ä≠  A borrow‚Äôd staff.  At length he reach‚Äôd his home,
‚Ä≠  Where (on the sudden and so wretched come)
‚Ä≠  Nor we nor much our elders once did dream
‚Ä≠  Of his return there, but did wrongs extreme
‚Ä≠  Of words and blows to him; all which he bore
‚Ä≠  With that old patience he had learn‚Äôd before.
‚Ä≠  But when the mind of Jove had rais‚Äôd his own,
‚Ä≠  His son and he fetch‚Äôd all their armour down,
‚Ä≠  Fast-lock‚Äôd the doors, and, to prepare their use,
‚Ä≠  He will‚Äôd his wife, for first mean, to produce
‚Ä≠  His bow to us to draw; of which no one
‚Ä≠  Could stir the string; himself yet set upon
‚Ä≠  The deadly strength it held, drew all with ease,
‚Ä≠  Shot through the steels, and then began to seize
‚Ä≠  Our armless bosoms; striking first the breast
‚Ä≠  Of king Antinous, and then the rest
‚Ä≠  In heaps turn‚Äôd over; hopeful of his end
‚Ä≠  Because some God, he knew, stood firm his friend.
‚Ä≠  Nor prov‚Äôd it worse with him, but all in flood
‚Ä≠  The pavement straight blush‚Äôd with our vital blood.
‚Ä≠  And thus our souls came here; our bodies laid
‚Ä≠  Neglected in his roofs, no word convey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To any friend to take us home and give
‚Ä≠  Our wounds fit balming, nor let such as live
‚Ä≠  Entomb our deaths, and for our fortunes shed
‚Ä≠  Those tears and dead-rites that renown the dead.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Atrides‚Äô ghost gave answer:  ‚ÄúO bless‚Äôd son
‚Ä≠  Of old Laertes, thou at length hast won
‚Ä≠  With mighty virtue thy unmatch√©d wife.
‚Ä≠  How good a knowledge, how untouch‚Äôd a life,
‚Ä≠  Hath wise Penelope!  How well she laid
‚Ä≠  Her husband‚Äôs rights up, whom she lov‚Äôd a maid!
‚Ä≠  For which her virtues shall extend applause,
‚Ä≠  Beyond the circles frail mortality draws;
‚Ä≠  The deathless in this vale of death comprising
‚Ä≠  Her praise in numbers into infinites rising.
‚Ä≠  The daughter Tyndarus begat begot
‚Ä≠  No such chaste thoughts, but cut the virgin knot
‚Ä≠  That knit her spouse and her with murd‚Äôrous swords.
‚Ä≠  For which posterities shall put hateful words
‚Ä≠  To notes of her that all her sex defam‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And for her ill shall ev‚Äôn the good be blam‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     To this effect these these digressions made
‚Ä≠  In hell, earth‚Äôs dark and ever-hiding shade.
‚Ä≠     Ulysses and his son, now past the town,
‚Ä≠  Soon reach‚Äôd the field elaborately grown
‚Ä≠  By old Laertes‚Äô labour, when, with cares
‚Ä≠  For his lost son, he left all court affairs,
‚Ä≠  And took to this rude upland; which with toil
‚Ä≠  He made a sweet and habitable soil;
‚Ä≠  Where stood a house to him; about which ran,
‚Ä≠  In turnings thick and labyrinthian,
‚Ä≠  Poor hovels, where his necessary men
‚Ä≠  That did those works (of pleasure to him then)
‚Ä≠  Might sit, and eat, and sleep.  In his own house
‚Ä≠  An old Sicilian dame liv‚Äôd, studious
‚Ä≠  To serve his sour age with her cheerful pains.
‚Ä≠     Then said Ulysses to his son and swains:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúGo you to town, and for your dinner kill
‚Ä≠  The best swine ye can choose; myself will still
‚Ä≠  Stay with my father, and assay his eye
‚Ä≠  If my acknowledg‚Äôd truth it can descry,
‚Ä≠  Or that my long time‚Äôs travel doth so change
‚Ä≠  My sight to him that I appear as strange.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Thus gave he arms to them, and home they hied.
‚Ä≠  Ulysses to the fruitful field applied
‚Ä≠  His present place; nor found he Dolius there,
‚Ä≠  His sons, or any servant, anywhere
‚Ä≠  In all that spacious ground; all gone from thence
‚Ä≠  Were dragging bushes to repair a fence,
‚Ä≠  Old Dolius leading all.  Ulysses found
‚Ä≠  His father far above in that fair ground,
‚Ä≠  Employ‚Äôd in proining of a plant; his weeds
‚Ä≠  All torn and tatter‚Äôd, fit for homely deeds,
‚Ä≠  But not for him.  Upon his legs he wore
‚Ä≠  Patch‚Äôd boots to guard him from the bramble‚Äôs gore;
‚Ä≠  His hands had thorn-proof hedging mittens on;
‚Ä≠  His head a goat-skin casque; through all which shone
‚Ä≠  His heart giv‚Äôn over to abjectest moan.
‚Ä≠     Him when Ulysses saw consum‚Äôd with age,
‚Ä≠  And all the ensigns on him that the rage
‚Ä≠  Of grief presented, he brake out in tears;
‚Ä≠  And, taking stand then where a tree of pears
‚Ä≠  Shot high his forehead over him, his mind
‚Ä≠  Had much contention, if to yield to kind,
‚Ä≠  Make straight way to his father, kiss, embrace,
‚Ä≠  Tell his return, and put on all the face
‚Ä≠  And fashion of his instant-told return;
‚Ä≠  Or stay th‚Äô impulsion, and the long day burn
‚Ä≠  Of his quite loss giv‚Äôn in his father‚Äôs fear
‚Ä≠  A little longer, trying first his cheer
‚Ä≠  With some free dalliance, th‚Äô earnest being so near.
‚Ä≠     This course his choice preferr‚Äôd, and forth he went.
‚Ä≠  His father then his aged shoulders bent
‚Ä≠  Beneath what years had stoop‚Äôd, about a tree
‚Ä≠  Busily digging:  ‚ÄúO, old man,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúYou want no skill to dress and deck your ground,
‚Ä≠  For all your plants doth order‚Äôd distance bound.
‚Ä≠  No apple, pear, or olive, fig; or vine,
‚Ä≠  Nor any plat or quarter you confine
‚Ä≠  To grass or flow‚Äôrs stands empty of your care,
‚Ä≠  Which shows exact in each peculiar;
‚Ä≠  And yet (which let not move you) you bestow
‚Ä≠  No care upon yourself, though to this show
‚Ä≠  Of outward irksomeness to what you are
‚Ä≠  You labour with an inward froward care,
‚Ä≠  Which is your age, that should wear all without
‚Ä≠  More neat and cherishing.  I make no doubt
‚Ä≠  That any sloth you use procures your lord
‚Ä≠  To let an old man go so much abhorr‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In all his weeds; nor shines there in your look
‚Ä≠  A fashion and a goodliness so took
‚Ä≠  With abject qualities to merit this
‚Ä≠  Nasty entreaty.  Your resemblance is
‚Ä≠  A very king‚Äôs, and shines through this retreat.
‚Ä≠  You look like one that having wash‚Äôd and eat
‚Ä≠  Should sleep securely, lying sweet and neat.
‚Ä≠  _It is the ground of age, when cares abuse it,
‚Ä≠  To know life‚Äôs end, and, as ‚Äôtis sweet, so use it._
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúBut utter truth, and tell what lord is he
‚Ä≠  That rates your labour and your liberty?
‚Ä≠  Whose orchard is it that you husband thus?
‚Ä≠  Or quit me this doubt, for if Ithacus
‚Ä≠  This kingdom claims for his, the man I found
‚Ä≠  At first arrival here is hardly sound
‚Ä≠  Of brain or civil, not enduring stay
‚Ä≠  To tell nor hear me my inquiry out
‚Ä≠  Of that my friend, if still he bore about
‚Ä≠  His life and being, or were div‚Äôd to death,
‚Ä≠  And in the house of him that harboureth
‚Ä≠  The souls of men.  For once he liv‚Äôd my guest;
‚Ä≠  My land and house retaining interest
‚Ä≠  In his abode there; where there sojourn‚Äôd none
‚Ä≠  As guest from any foreign region
‚Ä≠  Of more price with me.  He deriv‚Äôd his race
‚Ä≠  From Ithaca, and said his father was
‚Ä≠  Laertes, surnam‚Äôd Arcesiades,
‚Ä≠  I had him home, and all the offices
‚Ä≠  Perform‚Äôd to him that fitted any friend,
‚Ä≠  Whose proof I did to wealthy gifts extend:
‚Ä≠  Seven talents gold; a bowl all-silver, set
‚Ä≠  With pots of flowers; twelve robes that had no pleat!
‚Ä≠  Twelve cloaks, or mantles, of delicious dye;
‚Ä≠  Twelve inner weeds; twelve suits of tapestry.
‚Ä≠  I gave him likewise women skill‚Äôd in use
‚Ä≠  Of loom and needle, freeing him to choose
‚Ä≠  Four the most fair.‚Äù  His father, weeping, said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúStranger!  The earth to which you are convey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Is Ithaca; by such rude men possess‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Unjust and insolent, as first address‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To your encounter; but the gifts you gave
‚Ä≠  Were giv‚Äôn, alas!  to the ungrateful grave.
‚Ä≠  If with his people, where you now arrive,
‚Ä≠  Your fate had been to find your friend alive,
‚Ä≠  You should have found like guest-rites from his hand,
‚Ä≠  Like gifts, and kind pass to your wish√©d land.
‚Ä≠  But how long since receiv‚Äôd you for your guest
‚Ä≠  Your friend, my son, who was th‚Äô unhappiest
‚Ä≠  Of all men breathing, if he were at all?
‚Ä≠  O born when Fates and ill-aspects let fall
‚Ä≠  A cruel influence for him!  Far away
‚Ä≠  From friends and country destin‚Äôd to allay.
‚Ä≠  The sea-bred appetites, or, left ashore,
‚Ä≠  To be by fowls and upland monsters tore,
‚Ä≠  His life‚Äôs kind authors nor his wealthy wife
‚Ä≠  Bemoaning, as behov‚Äôd, his parted life,
‚Ä≠  Nor closing, as in honour‚Äôs course it lies
‚Ä≠  To all men dead, in bed his dying eyes.
‚Ä≠  But give me knowledge of your name and race.
‚Ä≠  What city bred you?  Where the anchoring-place
‚Ä≠  Your ship now rides-at lies that shor‚Äôd you here
‚Ä≠  And where your men?  Or, if a passenger
‚Ä≠  In other keels you came, who (giving land
‚Ä≠  To your adventures here, some other strand
‚Ä≠  To fetch in further course) have left to us
‚Ä≠  Your welcome presence?‚Äù  His reply was thus:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI am of Alyband√©, where I hold
‚Ä≠  My name‚Äôs chief house, to much renown extoll‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  My father Aphidantes, fam‚Äôd to spring
‚Ä≠  From Polypemon, the Molossian king.
‚Ä≠  My name Eperitus.  My taking land
‚Ä≠  On this fair Isle was rul‚Äôd by the command
‚Ä≠  Of God or fortune, quite against consent
‚Ä≠  Of my free purpose, that in course was bent
‚Ä≠  For th‚Äô isle Sicania.  My ship is held
‚Ä≠  Far from the city, near an ample field.
‚Ä≠  And for Ulysses, since his pass from me
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTis now five years.  Unbless‚Äôd by destiny,
‚Ä≠  That all this time hath had the fate to err!
‚Ä≠  Though, at his parting, good birds did augur
‚Ä≠  His putting-off, and on his right hand flew,
‚Ä≠  Which to his passage my affection drew,
‚Ä≠  His spirit joyful; and my hope was now
‚Ä≠  To guest with him, and see his hand bestow
‚Ä≠  Rites of our friendship.‚Äù  This a cloud of grief
‚Ä≠  Cast over all the forces of his life.
‚Ä≠  With both his hands the burning dust he swept
‚Ä≠  Up from the earth, which on his head he heapt,
‚Ä≠  And fetch‚Äôd a sigh as in it life were broke.
‚Ä≠  Which grieved his son, and gave so smart a stroke
‚Ä≠  Upon his nostrils with the inward stripe,
‚Ä≠  That up the vein rose there; and weeping ripe
‚Ä≠  He was to see his sire feel such woe
‚Ä≠  For his dissembled joy; which now let go,
‚Ä≠  He sprung from earth, embrac‚Äôd and kiss‚Äôd his sire,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúO father!  He of whom y‚Äô enquire
‚Ä≠  Am I myself, that, from you twenty years,
‚Ä≠  Is now return‚Äôd.  But do not break in tears,
‚Ä≠  For now we must not forms of kind maintain,
‚Ä≠  But haste and guard the substance.  I have slain
‚Ä≠  All my wife‚Äôs Wooers, so revenging now
‚Ä≠  Their wrong so long time suffer‚Äôd.  Take not you
‚Ä≠  The comfort of my coming then to heart
‚Ä≠  At this glad instant, but, in prov‚Äôd desert
‚Ä≠  Of your grave judgment, give moan glad suspense,
‚Ä≠  And on the sudden put this consequence
‚Ä≠  In act as absolute, as all time went
‚Ä≠  To ripening of your resolute assent.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     All this haste made not his staid faith so free
‚Ä≠  To trust his words; who said:  ‚ÄúIf you are he,
‚Ä≠  Approve it by some sign.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis scar then see,‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Replied Ulysses,  ‚Äúgiv‚Äôn me by the boar
‚Ä≠  Slain in Parnassus, I being sent before
‚Ä≠  By your‚Äôs and by my honour‚Äôd mother‚Äôs will,
‚Ä≠  To see your sire Autolycus fulfill
‚Ä≠  The gifts he vow‚Äôd at giving of my name.
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll tell you, too, the trees, in goodly frame
‚Ä≠  Of this fair orchard, that I ask‚Äôd of you
‚Ä≠  Being yet a child, and follow‚Äôd for your show
‚Ä≠  And name of ev‚Äôry tree.  You gave me then
‚Ä≠  Of fig-trees forty, apple-bearers ten,
‚Ä≠  Pear-trees thirteen, and fifty ranks of vine;
‚Ä≠  Each one of which a season did confine
‚Ä≠  For his best eating.  Not a grape did grow
‚Ä≠  That grew not there, and had his heavy brow
‚Ä≠  When Jove‚Äôs fair daughters, the all ripening Hours,
‚Ä≠  Gave timely date to it.‚Äù  This charg‚Äôd the pow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  Both of his knees and heart with such impression
‚Ä≠  Of sudden comfort, that it gave possession
‚Ä≠  Of all to Trance, the signs were all so true,
‚Ä≠  And did the love that gave them so renew.
‚Ä≠  He cast his arms about his son and sunk,
‚Ä≠  The circle slipping to his feet; so shrunk
‚Ä≠  Were all his age‚Äôs forces with the fire
‚Ä≠  Of his young love rekindled.  The old sire
‚Ä≠  The son took up quite lifeless.  But his breath
‚Ä≠  Again respiring, and his soul from death
‚Ä≠  His body‚Äôs pow‚Äôr recov‚Äôring, out he cried,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúO Jupiter!  I now have tried
‚Ä≠  That still there live in heav‚Äôn rememb‚Äôring Gods
‚Ä≠  Of men that serve them; though the periods
‚Ä≠  They set on their appearances are long
‚Ä≠  In best men‚Äôs suff‚Äôrings, yet as sure as strong
‚Ä≠  They are in comforts, be their strange delays
‚Ä≠  Extended never so from days to days.
‚Ä≠  Yet see the short joys or the soon-mix‚Äôd fears
‚Ä≠  Of helps withheld by them so many years!
‚Ä≠  For if the Wooers now have paid the pain
‚Ä≠  Due to their impious pleasures, now again
‚Ä≠  Extreme fear takes me, lest we straight shall see
‚Ä≠  The Ithacensians here in mutiny,
‚Ä≠  Their messengers dispatch‚Äôd to win to friend
‚Ä≠  The Cephallenian cities.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDo not spend
‚Ä≠  Your thoughts on these cares,‚Äù  said his suff‚Äôring son,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúBut be of comfort, and see that course run
‚Ä≠  That best may shun the worst.  Our house is near,
‚Ä≠  Telemachus and both his herdsmen there
‚Ä≠  To dress our supper with their utmost haste;
‚Ä≠  And thither haste we.‚Äù  This said, forth they past,
‚Ä≠  Came home, and found Telemachus at feast
‚Ä≠  With both his swains; while who had done, all drest
‚Ä≠  With baths and balms and royally array‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The old king was by his Sicilian maid.
‚Ä≠  By whose side Pallas stood, his crook‚Äôd-age straight‚Äôning,
‚Ä≠  His flesh more plumping, and his looks enlight‚Äôning.
‚Ä≠  Who issuing then to view, his son admir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The Gods‚Äô aspects into his form inspir‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúO father, certainly some God
‚Ä≠  By your addression in this state hath stood,
‚Ä≠  More great, more rev‚Äôrend, rend‚Äôring you by far
‚Ä≠  At all your parts than of yourself you are!‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúI would to Jove,‚Äù  said he,  ‚Äúthe Sun, and She
‚Ä≠  That bears Jove‚Äôs shield, the state had stood with me
‚Ä≠  That help‚Äôd me take-in the well-builded tow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  Of strong Nericus (the Cephalian pow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  To that fair city leading) two days past,
‚Ä≠  While with the Wooers thy conflict did last,
‚Ä≠  And I had then been in the Wooers‚Äô wreak!
‚Ä≠  I should have help‚Äôd thee so to render weak
‚Ä≠  Their stubborn knees, that in thy joy‚Äôs desert
‚Ä≠  Thy breast had been too little for thy heart.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, and supper order‚Äôd by their men,
‚Ä≠  They sat to it; old Dolius ent‚Äôring then,
‚Ä≠  And with him, tried with labour, his sons came,
‚Ä≠  Call‚Äôd by their mother, the Sicilian dame
‚Ä≠  That brought them up and dress‚Äôd their father‚Äôs fare,
‚Ä≠  As whose age grew, with it increas‚Äôd her care
‚Ä≠  To see him serv‚Äôd as fitted.  When thus set
‚Ä≠  These men beheld Ulysses there at meat,
‚Ä≠  They knew him, and astonish‚Äôd in the place
‚Ä≠  Stood at his presence; who, with words of grace,
‚Ä≠  Call‚Äôd to old Dolius, saying:  ‚ÄúCome and eat,
‚Ä≠  And banish all astonishment.  Your meat
‚Ä≠  Hath long been ready, and ourselves made stay,
‚Ä≠  Expecting ever when your wish√©d way
‚Ä≠  Would reach amongst us.‚Äù  This brought fiercely on
‚Ä≠  Old Dolius from his stand; who ran upon,
‚Ä≠  With both his arms abroad, the King, and kiss‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of both his rapt up hands the either wrist,
‚Ä≠  Thus welcoming his presence:  ‚ÄúO my love,
‚Ä≠  Your presence here, for which all wishes strove,
‚Ä≠  No one expected.  Ev‚Äôn the Gods have gone
‚Ä≠  In guide before you to your mansi√≥n.
‚Ä≠  Welcome, and all joys to your heart contend.
‚Ä≠  Knows yet Penelope?  Or shall we send
‚Ä≠  Some one to tell her this?‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe knows,‚Äù  said he,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúWhat need these troubles, father, touch at thee?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Then came the sons of Dolius, and again
‚Ä≠  Went over with their father‚Äôs entertain,
‚Ä≠  Welcom‚Äôd, shook hands, and then to feast sat down.
‚Ä≠  About which while they sat, about the town
‚Ä≠  Fame flew, and shriek‚Äôd about the cruel death
‚Ä≠  And fate the Wooers had sustain‚Äôd beneath
‚Ä≠  Ulysses‚Äô roofs.  All heard; together all
‚Ä≠  From hence and thence met in Ulysses‚Äô hall,
‚Ä≠  Short-breath‚Äôd and noiseful, bore out all the dead
‚Ä≠  To instant burial, while their deaths were spread
‚Ä≠  To other neighbour cities where they liv‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  From whence in swiftest fisher-boats arriv‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Men to transfer them home.  In mean space here
‚Ä≠  The heavy nobles all in council were;
‚Ä≠  Where, met in much heap, up to all arose
‚Ä≠  Extremely-griev‚Äôd Eupitheus so to lose
‚Ä≠  His son Antinous, who, first of all,
‚Ä≠  By great Ulysses‚Äô hand had slaught‚Äôrous fall.
‚Ä≠  Whose father, weeping for him, said:  ‚ÄúO friends,
‚Ä≠  This man hath author‚Äôd works of dismal ends,
‚Ä≠  Long since conveying in his guide to Troy
‚Ä≠  Good men, and many that did ships employ,
‚Ä≠  All which are lost, and all their soldiers dead;
‚Ä≠  And now the best men Cephallenia bred
‚Ä≠  His hand hath slaughter‚Äôd.  Go we then (before
‚Ä≠  His ‚Äôscape to Pylos, or the Elians‚Äô shore,
‚Ä≠  Where rule the Epeans) ‚Äôgainst his horrid hand;
‚Ä≠  For we shall grieve, and infamy will brand
‚Ä≠  Our fames for ever, if we see our sons
‚Ä≠  And brothers end in these confusions,
‚Ä≠  Revenge left uninflicted.  Nor will I
‚Ä≠  Enjoy one day‚Äôs life more, but grieve and die
‚Ä≠  With instant onset.  Nor should you survive
‚Ä≠  To keep a base and beastly name alive.
‚Ä≠  Haste, then, lest flight prevent us.‚Äù  This with tears
‚Ä≠  His griefs advis‚Äôd, and made all sufferers
‚Ä≠  In his affliction.  But by this was come
‚Ä≠  Up to the council from Ulysses‚Äô home--
‚Ä≠  When sleep had left them, which the slaughters there
‚Ä≠  And their self-dangers from their eyes in fear
‚Ä≠  Had two nights intercepted--those two men
‚Ä≠  That just Ulysses sav‚Äôd out of the slain,
‚Ä≠  Which Medon and the sacred singer were.
‚Ä≠  These stood amidst the council; and the fear
‚Ä≠  The slaughter had impress‚Äôd in either‚Äôs look
‚Ä≠  Stuck still so ghastly, that amaze it strook
‚Ä≠  Through ev‚Äôry there beholder.  To whose ears
‚Ä≠  One thus enforc‚Äôd, in his fright, cause of theirs:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAttend me, Ithacensians!  This stern fact
‚Ä≠  Done by Ulysses was not put in act
‚Ä≠  Without the Gods‚Äô assistance.  These self eyes
‚Ä≠  Saw one of the immortal Deities
‚Ä≠  Close by Ulysses, Mentor‚Äôs form put on
‚Ä≠  At ev‚Äôry part.  And this sure Deity shone
‚Ä≠  Now near Ulysses, setting on his bold
‚Ä≠  And slaught‚Äôrous spirit, now the points controll‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of all the Wooers‚Äô weapons, round about
‚Ä≠  The arm‚Äôd house whisking, in continual rout
‚Ä≠  Their party putting, till in heaps they fell.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This news new fears did through their spirits impell,
‚Ä≠  When Halitherses (honour‚Äôd Mastor‚Äôs son,
‚Ä≠  Who of them all saw only what was done
‚Ä≠  Present and future) the much-knowing man
‚Ä≠  And aged hero√´ this plain course ran
‚Ä≠  Amongst their counsels:  ‚ÄúGive me likewise ear,
‚Ä≠  And let me tell ye, friends, that these ills bear
‚Ä≠  On your malignant spleens their sad effects,
‚Ä≠  Who not what I persuaded gave respects,
‚Ä≠  Nor what the people‚Äôs pastor, Mentor, said,--
‚Ä≠  That you should see your issues‚Äô follies stay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In those foul courses, by their petulant life
‚Ä≠  The goods devouring, scandalling the wife
‚Ä≠  Of no mean person, who, they still would say,
‚Ä≠  Could never more see his returning-day.
‚Ä≠  Which yet appearing now, now give it trust,
‚Ä≠  And yield to my free counsels:  Do not thrust
‚Ä≠  Your own safe persons on the acts your sons
‚Ä≠  So dearly bought, lest their confusions
‚Ä≠  On your lov‚Äôd heads your like addictions draw.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This stood so far from force of any law
‚Ä≠  To curb their loose attempts, that much the more
‚Ä≠  They rush‚Äôd to wreak, and made rude tumult roar.
‚Ä≠  The greater part of all the court arose;
‚Ä≠  Good counsel could not ill designs dispose.
‚Ä≠  Eupitheus was persuader of the course,
‚Ä≠  Which, c√≥mplete-arm‚Äôd, they put in present force;
‚Ä≠  The rest sat still in council.  These men met
‚Ä≠  Before the broad town, in a place they set
‚Ä≠  All girt in arms; Eupitheus choosing chief
‚Ä≠  To all their follies, who put grief to grief,
‚Ä≠  And in his slaughter‚Äôd son‚Äôs revenge did burn.
‚Ä≠  But Fate gave never feet to his return,
‚Ä≠  Ordaining there his death.  Then Pallas spake
‚Ä≠  To Jove, her Father, with intent to make
‚Ä≠  His will high arbiter of th‚Äô act design‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And ask‚Äôd of him what his unsearch√©d mind
‚Ä≠  Held undiscover‚Äôd?  If with arms, and ill,
‚Ä≠  And grave encounter he, would first fulfill
‚Ä≠  His sacred purpose, or both parts combine
‚Ä≠  In peaceful friendship?  He ask‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúWhy incline
‚Ä≠  These doubts thy counsels?  Hast not thou decreed
‚Ä≠  That Ithacus should come and give his deed
‚Ä≠  The glory of revenge on these and theirs?
‚Ä≠  Perform thy will; the frame of these affairs
‚Ä≠  Have this fit issue: When Ulysses‚Äô hand
‚Ä≠  Hath reach‚Äôd full wreak, his then renown‚Äôd command
‚Ä≠  Shall reign for ever, faithful truces strook
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTwixt him and all; for ev‚Äôry man shall brook
‚Ä≠  His sons‚Äô and brothers‚Äô slaughters; by our mean
‚Ä≠  To send Oblivion in, expunging clean
‚Ä≠  The character of enmity in them all,
‚Ä≠  As in best leagues before.  _Peace, festival,
‚Ä≠  And riches in abundance, be the state
‚Ä≠  That crowns the close of wise Ulysses‚Äô Fate.‚Äù_
‚Ä≠  This spurr‚Äôd the free, who from heav‚Äôn‚Äôs continent
‚Ä≠  To th‚Äô Ithacensian isle made straight descent.
‚Ä≠  Where, dinner past, Ulysses said:  ‚ÄúSome one
‚Ä≠  Look out to see their nearness.‚Äù  Dolius‚Äô son
‚Ä≠  Made present speed abroad, and saw them nigh,
‚Ä≠  Ran back, and told, bade arm; and instantly
‚Ä≠  Were all in arms.  Ulysses‚Äô part was four,
‚Ä≠  And six more sons of Dolius; all his pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  Two only more, which were his aged sire
‚Ä≠  And like-year‚Äôd Dolius, whose lives‚Äô-slak‚Äôd fire
‚Ä≠  All-white had left their heads, yet, driv‚Äôn by need,
‚Ä≠  Made soldiers both of necessary deed.
‚Ä≠  And now, all-girt in arms, the ports set wide,
‚Ä≠  They sallied forth, Ulysses being their guide;
‚Ä≠  And to them in the instant Pallas came,
‚Ä≠  In form and voice like Mentor, who a flame
‚Ä≠  Inspir‚Äôd of comfort in Ulysses‚Äô heart
‚Ä≠  With her seen presence.  To his son, apart,
‚Ä≠  He thus then spake:  ‚ÄúNow, son, your eyes shall see,
‚Ä≠  Expos‚Äôd in slaught‚Äôrous fight, the enemy,
‚Ä≠  Against whom who shall best serve will be seen.
‚Ä≠  Disgrace not then your race, that yet hath been
‚Ä≠  For force and fortitude the foremost tried
‚Ä≠  Of all earth‚Äôs offsprings.‚Äù  His true son replied:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúYourself shall see, lov‚Äôd father, if you please,
‚Ä≠  That my deservings shall in nought digress
‚Ä≠  From best fame of our race‚Äôs foremost merit.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  The old king sprung for joy to hear his spirit,
‚Ä≠  And said:  ‚ÄúO lov‚Äôd Immortals, what a day
‚Ä≠  Do your clear bounties to my life display!
‚Ä≠  I joy, past measure, to behold my son
‚Ä≠  And nephew close in such contention
‚Ä≠  Of virtues martial.‚Äù  Pallas, standing near,
‚Ä≠  Said:  ‚ÄúO my friend!  Of all supremely dear,
‚Ä≠  Seed of Arcesius, pray to Jove and Her
‚Ä≠  That rules in arms, his daughter, and a dart,
‚Ä≠  Spritefully brandish‚Äôd, hurl at th‚Äô adverse part.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he pray‚Äôd; and she a mighty force
‚Ä≠  Inspir‚Äôd within him, who gave instant course
‚Ä≠  To his brave-brandish‚Äôd lance, which struck the brass
‚Ä≠  That cheek‚Äôd Eupitheus‚Äô casque, and thrust his pass
‚Ä≠  Quite through his head; who fell, and sounded falling,
‚Ä≠  His arms the sound again from earth recalling.
‚Ä≠     Ulysses and his son rush‚Äôd on before,
‚Ä≠  And with their both-way-headed darts did gore
‚Ä≠  Their enemies‚Äô breasts so thick, that all had gone
‚Ä≠  The way of slaughter, had not Pallas thrown
‚Ä≠  Her voice betwixt them, charging all to stay
‚Ä≠  And spare expense of blood.  Her voice did fray
‚Ä≠  The blood so from their faces that it left
‚Ä≠  A greenish paleness; all their hands it reft
‚Ä≠  Of all their weapons, falling thence to earth;
‚Ä≠  And to the common mother of their birth,
‚Ä≠  The city, all fled, in desire to save
‚Ä≠  The lives yet left them.  Then Ulysses gave
‚Ä≠  A horrid shout, and like Jove‚Äôs eagle flew
‚Ä≠  In fiery pursuit, till Saturnius threw
‚Ä≠  His smoking lightning ‚Äôtwixt them, that had fall
‚Ä≠  Before Minerva, who then out did call
‚Ä≠  Thus to Ulysses:  ‚ÄúBorn of Jove!  Abstain
‚Ä≠  From further bloodshed.  Jove‚Äôs hand in the slain
‚Ä≠  Hath equall‚Äôd in their pains their prides to thee.
‚Ä≠  Abstain, then, lest you move the Deity.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Again then, ‚Äôtwixt both parts the Seed of Jove,
‚Ä≠  Athenian Pallas, of all future love
‚Ä≠  A league compos‚Äôd, and for her form took choice
‚Ä≠  Of Mentor‚Äôs likeness both in limb and voice.

‚Ä≠  THE END OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH AND LAST BOOK OF HOMER‚ÄôS ODYSSEYS.



‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúSO WROUGHT DIVINE ULYSSES‚Äù

‚Ä≠  _So wrought divine Ulysses through his woes,
‚Ä≠  So crown‚Äôd the light with him his mother's throes,
‚Ä≠  As through his great Renowner I have wrought,
‚Ä≠  And my safe sail to sacred anchor brought.
‚Ä≠  Nor did the Argive ship more burthen feel,
‚Ä≠  That bore the care of all men in her keel,
‚Ä≠  That my adventurous bark; the Colchian fleece
‚Ä≠  Not half so precious as this Soul of Greece,
‚Ä≠  In whose Songs I have made our shores rejoice,
‚Ä≠  And Greek itself vail to our English voice.
‚Ä≠  Yet this inestimable Pearl will all
‚Ä≠  Our dunghill chanticleers but obvious call;
‚Ä≠  Each modern scraper this Gem scratching by,
‚Ä≠  His oat preferring far.  Let such let lie.
‚Ä≠  So scorn the stars the clouds, as true-soul'd men
‚Ä≠  Despise deceivers.  For, as clouds would fain
‚Ä≠  Obscure the stars, yet (regions left below
‚Ä≠  With all their envies) bar them but of show,
‚Ä≠  For they shine ever, and will shine, when they
‚Ä≠  Dissolve in sinks, make mire, and temper clay;
‚Ä≠  So puff'd impostors (our muse-vapours) strive,
‚Ä≠  With their self-blown additions, to deprive
‚Ä≠  Men solid of their full, though infinite short
‚Ä≠  They come in their compare, and false report
‚Ä≠  Of levelling or touching at their light,
‚Ä≠  That still retain their radiance, and clear right,
‚Ä≠  And shall shine ever, when, alas!  one blast
‚Ä≠  Of least disgrace tears down th' impostor's mast,
‚Ä≠  His tops and tacklings, his whole freight, and he
‚Ä≠  Confiscate to the fishy monarchy,
‚Ä≠  His trash, by foolish Fame brought now, from hence
‚Ä≠  Given to serve mackarel forth, and frankincense.
‚Ä≠  Such then, and any too soft-eyed to see,
‚Ä≠  Through works so solid, any worth, so free
‚Ä≠  Of all the learn'd professions, as is fit
‚Ä≠  To praise at such price, let him think his wit
‚Ä≠  Too weak to rate it, rather than oppose
‚Ä≠  With his poor pow'rs Ages and Hosts of Foes._



‚Ä≠  _TO THE RUINS OF TROY AND GREECE_

‚Ä≠  _Troy rac'd, Greece wrack'd, who mourns?  Ye both may boast,
‚Ä≠  Else th' Iliads and Odysseys had been lost!_



‚Ä≠  _AD DEUM_

‚Ä≠  _The Only True God (betwixt Whom and me
‚Ä≠  I only bound my comfort, and agree
‚Ä≠  With all my actions) only truly knows,
‚Ä≠  And can judge truly, me, with all that goes
‚Ä≠  To all my faculties, In Whose free Grace
‚Ä≠  And Inspiration I only place
‚Ä≠  All means to know (with my means, study, pray‚Äôr,
‚Ä≠  In and from His Word taken) stair by stair,
‚Ä≠  In all continual contentation, rising
‚Ä≠  To knowledge of His Truth, and practising
‚Ä≠  His Will in it, with my sole Saviour‚Äôs Aid,
‚Ä≠  Guide, and Enlight‚Äôning; nothing done, nor said,
‚Ä≠  Nor thought, that good is, but acknowledg‚Äôd by
‚Ä≠  His Inclination, Skill, and Faculty.
‚Ä≠  By which, to find the way out to His Love
‚Ä≠  Past all the worlds, the sphere is where doth move
‚Ä≠  My studies, pray‚Äôrs, and pow‚Äôrs; no pleasure taken
‚Ä≠  But sign‚Äôd by His, for which, my blood forsaken,
‚Ä≠  My soul I cleave to, and what (in His Blood
‚Ä≠  That hath redeem‚Äôd, cleans‚Äôd, taught her) fits her good._

‚Ä≠  _DEO OPT. MAX. GLORIA_



‚Ä≠  BATRACHOMYOMACHIA

‚Ä≠  THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY

‚Ä≠  TO MY EVER MOST-WORTHY-TO-BE-MOST HONOURED
‚Ä≠  LORD, THE EARL OF SOMERSET, ETC.

‚Ä≠  _Not forc‚Äôd by fortune, but since your free mind
‚Ä≠  (Made by affliction) rests in choice resign‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To calm retreat, laid quite beneath the wind
‚Ä≠  Of grace and glory, I well know, my Lord,
‚Ä≠  You would not be entitled to a word
‚Ä≠  That might a thought remove from your repose,
‚Ä≠  To thunder and spit flames, as greatness does,
‚Ä≠  For all the trumps that still tell where he goes.
‚Ä≠  Of which trumps Dedication being one,
‚Ä≠  Methinks I see you start to hear it blown.
‚Ä≠     But this is no such trump as summons lords
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôGainst Envy‚Äôs steel to draw their leaden swords,
‚Ä≠  Or ‚Äôgainst hare-lipp‚Äôd Detraction, Contempt,
‚Ä≠  All which from all resistance stand exempt,
‚Ä≠  It being as hard to sever wrong from merit,
‚Ä≠  As meat-indu‚Äôd from blood, or blood from spirit.
‚Ä≠  Nor in the spirit‚Äôs chariot rides the soul
‚Ä≠  In bodies chaste, with more divine control,
‚Ä≠  Nor virtue shines more in a lovely face,
‚Ä≠  Than true desert is stuck off with disgrace.
‚Ä≠  And therefore Truth itself, that had to bless
‚Ä≠  The merit of it all, Almightiness,
‚Ä≠  Would not protect it from the bane and ban
‚Ä≠  Of all moods most distraught and Stygian;
‚Ä≠  As counting it the crown of all desert,
‚Ä≠  Borne to heaven, to take of earth, no part
‚Ä≠  Of false joy here, for joys-there-endless troth,
‚Ä≠  Nor sell his birthright for a mess of broth.
‚Ä≠  But stay and still sustain, and his bliss bring,
‚Ä≠  Like to the hatching of the blackthorn‚Äôs spring,
‚Ä≠  With bitter frosts, and smarting hailstorms, forth.
‚Ä≠  Fates love bees‚Äô labours; only Pain crown's Worth.
‚Ä≠  This Dedication calls no greatness, then,
‚Ä≠  To patron this greatness-creating pen,
‚Ä≠  Nor you to add to your dead calm a breath,
‚Ä≠  For those arm‚Äôd angels, that in spite of death
‚Ä≠  Inspir‚Äôd those flow‚Äôrs that wrought this Poet‚Äôs wreath,
‚Ä≠  Shall keep it ever, Poesy‚Äôs steepest star,
‚Ä≠  As in Earth‚Äôs flaming walls, Heaven's sevenfold Car,
‚Ä≠  From all the wilds of Neptune‚Äôs wat‚Äôry sphere,
‚Ä≠  For ever guards the Erymanthian bear.
‚Ä≠     Since then your Lordship settles in your shade
‚Ä≠  A life retir‚Äôd, and no retreat is made
‚Ä≠  But to some strength, (for else ‚Äôtis no retreat,
‚Ä≠  But rudely running from your battle‚Äôs heat)
‚Ä≠  I give this as your strength; your strength, my Lord,
‚Ä≠  In counsels and examples, that afford
‚Ä≠  More guard than whole hosts of corporeal pow‚Äôr,
‚Ä≠  And more deliverance teach the fatal hour.
‚Ä≠     Turn not your med‚Äôcine then to your disease,
‚Ä≠  By your too set and slight repulse of these,
‚Ä≠  The adjuncts of your matchless Odysses;
‚Ä≠  Since on that wisest mind of man relies
‚Ä≠  Refuge from all life‚Äôs infelicities.
‚Ä≠     Nor sing these such division from them,
‚Ä≠  But that these spin the thread of the same stream
‚Ä≠  From one self distaff‚Äôs stuff; for Poesy‚Äôs pen,
‚Ä≠  Through all themes, is t‚Äô inform the lives of men;
‚Ä≠  All whose retreats need strengths of all degrees;
‚Ä≠  Without which, had you even Herculean knees,
‚Ä≠  Your foes‚Äô fresh charges would at length prevail,
‚Ä≠  To leave your noblest suff‚Äôrance no least sail.
‚Ä≠  Strength then the object is of all retreats;
‚Ä≠  Strength needs no friends‚Äô trust; strength your foes defeats.
‚Ä≠  Retire to strength, then, if eternal things,
‚Ä≠  And y‚Äôare eternal; for our knowing springs
‚Ä≠  Flow into those things that we truly know,
‚Ä≠  Which being eternal, we are render‚Äôd so.
‚Ä≠  And though your high-fix‚Äôd light pass infinite far
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô adviceful guide of my still-trembling star,
‚Ä≠  Yet hear what my discharg‚Äôd piece must foretel,
‚Ä≠  Standing your poor and perdue sentinel.
‚Ä≠  Kings may perhaps wish even your beggar‚Äôs-voice
‚Ä≠  To their eternities, how scorn‚Äôd a choice
‚Ä≠  Soever now it lies; and (dead) I may
‚Ä≠  Extend your life to light‚Äôs extremest ray.
‚Ä≠  If not, your Homer yet past doubt shall make
‚Ä≠  Immortal, like himself, your bounty's stake
‚Ä≠  Put in my hands, to propagate your fame;
‚Ä≠  Such virtue reigns in such united name.
‚Ä≠     Retire to him then for advice, and skill,
‚Ä≠  To know things call‚Äôd worst, best; and best, most ill.
‚Ä≠  Which known, truths best choose, and retire to still.
‚Ä≠  And as our English general, (whose name  [1]
‚Ä≠  Shall equal interest find in th‚Äô house of fame
‚Ä≠  With all Earth's great‚Äôst commanders,) in retreat
‚Ä≠  To Belgian Gant, stood all Spain‚Äôs armies‚Äô heat
‚Ä≠  By Parma led, though but one thousand strong;
‚Ä≠  Three miles together thrusting through the throng
‚Ä≠  Of th‚Äô enemy's horse, still pouring on their fall
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTwixt him and home, and thunder'd through them all;
‚Ä≠  The Gallic Monsieur standing on the wall,
‚Ä≠  And Wond‚Äôring at his dreadful discipline,
‚Ä≠  Fir‚Äôd with a valour that spit spirit divine;
‚Ä≠  In five battalions ranging all his men,
‚Ä≠  Bristl'd with pikes, and flank‚Äôd with flankers ten;
‚Ä≠  Gave fire still in his rear; retir‚Äôd, and wrought
‚Ä≠  Down to his fix‚Äôd strength still; retir‚Äôd and fought;
‚Ä≠  All the battalions of the enemy's horse
‚Ä≠  Storming upon him still their fieriest force;
‚Ä≠  Charge upon charge laid fresh; he, fresh as day,
‚Ä≠  Repulsing all, and forcing glorious way
‚Ä≠  Into the gates, that gasp‚Äôd, (as swoons for air,)
‚Ä≠  And took their life in, with untouch‚Äôd repair:--
‚Ä≠  So fight out, sweet Earl, your retreat in peace;
‚Ä≠  No ope-war equals that where privy prease
‚Ä≠  Of never-number‚Äôd odds if enemy,
‚Ä≠  Arm‚Äôd all by envy, in blind ambush lie,
‚Ä≠  To rush out like an opening threat‚Äôning sky,
‚Ä≠  Broke all in meteors round about your ears.
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôGainst which, though far from hence, through all your rears,
‚Ä≠  Have fires prepar‚Äôd; wisdom with wisdom flank,
‚Ä≠  And all your forces range in present rank;
‚Ä≠  Retiring as you now fought in your strength,
‚Ä≠  From all the force laid, in time's utmost length,
‚Ä≠  To charge, and basely come on you behind.
‚Ä≠  The doctrine of all which you here shall find,
‚Ä≠  And in the true glass of a human mind.
‚Ä≠  Your Odysses, the body letting see
‚Ä≠  All his life past, through infelicity,
‚Ä≠  And manage of it all.  In which to friend,
‚Ä≠  The full Muse brings you both the prime and end
‚Ä≠  Of all arts ambient in the orb of man;
‚Ä≠  Which never darkness most Cimmerian
‚Ä≠  Can give eclipse, since, blind, he all things saw,
‚Ä≠  And to all ever since liv‚Äôd lord and law.
‚Ä≠  And through our mere-learn‚Äôd men; and modern wise,
‚Ä≠  Taste not poor Poesy‚Äôs ingenuities,
‚Ä≠  Being crusted with their covetous leprosies,
‚Ä≠  But hold her pains worse than the spiders‚Äô work,
‚Ä≠  And lighter than the shadow of a cork,
‚Ä≠  Yet th‚Äô ancient learn‚Äôd, heat with celestial fire,
‚Ä≠  Affirms her flames so sacred and entire,
‚Ä≠  That not without God's greatest grace she can
‚Ä≠  Fall in the wid‚Äôst capacity of man._
‚Ä≠     _If yet the vile soul of this verminous time
‚Ä≠  Love more the sale-muse, and the squirrel's chime,
‚Ä≠  Than this full sphere of poesy‚Äôs sweetest prime,
‚Ä≠  Give them unenvied their vain vein and vent,
‚Ä≠  And rest your wings in his approv‚Äôd ascent
‚Ä≠  That yet was never reach‚Äôd, nor ever fell
‚Ä≠  Into affections bought with things that sell,
‚Ä≠  Being the sun's flow‚Äôr, and wrapt so in his sky
‚Ä≠  He cannot yield to every candle‚Äôs eye._

‚Ä≠_Whose most worthy discoveries, to your lordship's judicial
‚Ä≠perspective, in most subdue humility submitteth,_

‚Ä≠in his retreat before Gant, never before made sacred to memory.



‚Ä≠  THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE

‚Ä≠After this not only Prime of Poets, but Philosophers, had written
‚Ä≠his two great poems of Iliads and Odysses; which (for their first
‚Ä≠lights born before all learning) were worthily called the Sun and
‚Ä≠Moon of the Earth; finding no compensation, he writ in contempt
‚Ä≠of men this ridiculous poem of Vermin, giving them nobility of
‚Ä≠birth, valorous elocution not inferior to his heroes. At which the
‚Ä≠Gods themselves, put in amaze, called councils about their
‚Ä≠assistance of either army, and the justice of their quarrels, even to
‚Ä≠the mounting of Jove‚Äôs artillery against them, and discharge of his
‚Ä≠three-forked flashes; and all for the drowning of a mouse.  After
‚Ä≠which slight and only recreative touch, he betook him seriously to
‚Ä≠the honour of the Gods, in Hymns resounding all their peculiar
‚Ä≠titles, jurisdictions, and dignities; which he illustrates at all parts,
‚Ä≠as he had been continually conversant amongst them; and
‚Ä≠whatsoever authentic Poesy he omitted in the episodes contained in
‚Ä≠his Iliads and Odysses, he comprehends and concludes in his
‚Ä≠Hymns and Epigrams.  All his observance and honour of the Gods,
‚Ä≠rather moved their envies against him, than their rewards, or
‚Ä≠respects of his endeavours.  And so like a man _verecundi ingenii_
‚Ä≠(which he witnesseth of himself) he lived unhonoured and needy
‚Ä≠till his death; and yet notwithstanding all men‚Äôs servile and
‚Ä≠manacled miseries, to his most absolute and never-equalled merit,
‚Ä≠yea even bursten profusion to imposture and impiety, hear our
‚Ä≠ever-the-same intranced, and never-sleeping, Master of the Muses,
‚Ä≠to his last accents, incomparably singing.



‚Ä≠  BATRACHOMYOMACHIA
‚Ä≠
‚Ä≠  Ent‚Äôring the fields, first let my vows call on
‚Ä≠  The Muses‚Äô whole quire out of Helicon
‚Ä≠  Into my heart, for such a poem‚Äôs sake,
‚Ä≠  As lately I did in my tables take,
‚Ä≠  And put into report upon my knees.
‚Ä≠  A fight so fierce, as might in all degrees
‚Ä≠  Fit Mars himself, and his tumultuous hand,
‚Ä≠  Glorying to dart to th‚Äô ears of every land
‚Ä≠  Of all the voice-divided;  [1]  and to show
‚Ä≠  How bravely did both Frogs and Mice bestow
‚Ä≠  In glorious fight their forces, even the deeds
‚Ä≠  Daring to imitate of Earth‚Äôs Giant Seeds.
‚Ä≠  Thus then men talk‚Äôd; this seed the strife begat:
‚Ä≠     The Mouse once dry, and ‚Äôscaped the dangerous cat,
‚Ä≠  Drench‚Äôd in the neighbour lake her tender beard,
‚Ä≠  To taste the sweetness of the wave it rear‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     The far-famed Fen-affecter, seeing him, said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúHo, stranger!  What are you, and whence, that tread
‚Ä≠  This shore of ours?  Who brought you forth?  Reply
‚Ä≠  What truth may witness, lest I find you lie.
‚Ä≠  If worth fruition of my love and me,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll have thee home, and hospitality
‚Ä≠  Of feast and gift, good and magnificent,
‚Ä≠  Bestow on thee; for all this confluent
‚Ä≠  Resounds my royalty; my name, the great
‚Ä≠  In blown-up-count‚Äônances and looks of threat,
‚Ä≠  Physignathus,  [2]  adored of all Frogs here
‚Ä≠  All their days‚Äô durance, and the empire bear
‚Ä≠  Of all their beings; mine own being begot
‚Ä≠  By royal Peleus,  [3]  mix‚Äôd in nuptial knot
‚Ä≠  With fair Hydromedusa,  [4]  on the bounds
‚Ä≠  Near which Eridanus  [5]  his race resounds.
‚Ä≠  And thee mine eye makes my conceit inclined
‚Ä≠  To reckon powerful both in form and mind,
‚Ä≠  A sceptre-bearer, and past others far
‚Ä≠  Advanc‚Äôd in all the fiery fights of war.
‚Ä≠  Come then, thy race to my renown commend.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     The Mouse made answer:  ‚ÄúWhy inquires my friend?
‚Ä≠  For what so well know men and Deities,
‚Ä≠  And all the wing‚Äôd affecters of the skies?
‚Ä≠  Psicharpax  [6]  I am call‚Äôd; Troxartes‚Äô  [7]  seed,
‚Ä≠  Surnamed the mighty-minded.  She that freed
‚Ä≠  Mine eyes from darkness was Lichomyle,  [8]
‚Ä≠  King Pternotroctes‚Äô  [9]  daughter, showing me,
‚Ä≠  Within an aged hovel, the young light,
‚Ä≠  Fed me with figs and nuts, and all the height
‚Ä≠  Of varied viands.  But unfold the cause,
‚Ä≠  Why, ‚Äôgainst similitude‚Äôs most equal laws
‚Ä≠  Observed in friendship, thou mak‚Äôst me thy friend?
‚Ä≠  Thy life the waters only help t‚Äô extend;
‚Ä≠  Mine, whatsoever men are used to eat,
‚Ä≠  Takes part with them at shore; their purest cheat,
‚Ä≠  Thrice boulted, kneaded, and subdued in paste,
‚Ä≠  In clean round kymnels, cannot be so fast
‚Ä≠  From my approaches kept but in I eat;
‚Ä≠  Nor cheesecakes full of finest Indian wheat,
‚Ä≠  That crusty-weeds  [10]  wear, large as ladies‚Äô trains;
‚Ä≠  Liverings,  [11]  white-skinn‚Äôd as ladies; nor the strains,
‚Ä≠  Of press‚Äôd milk, renneted; nor collops cut
‚Ä≠  Fresh from the flitch; nor junkets, such as put
‚Ä≠  Palates divine in appetite; nor any
‚Ä≠  Of all men‚Äôs delicates, though ne‚Äôer so many
‚Ä≠  Their cooks devise them, who each dish see deckt
‚Ä≠  With all the dainties all strange soils affect.  [12]
‚Ä≠  Yet am I not so sensual to fly
‚Ä≠  Of fields embattled the most fiery cry,
‚Ä≠  But rush out straight, and with the first in fight
‚Ä≠  Mix in adventure.  No man with affright
‚Ä≠  Can daunt my forces, though his body be
‚Ä≠  or never so immense a quantity,
‚Ä≠  But making up, even to his bed, access,
‚Ä≠  His fingers‚Äô ends dare with my teeth compress,
‚Ä≠  His feet taint likewise, and so soft seize both
‚Ä≠  They shall not taste th‚Äô impression of a tooth.
‚Ä≠  Sweet sleep shall hold his own in every eye
‚Ä≠  Where my tooth takes his tartest liberty.
‚Ä≠  But two there are, that always, far and near,
‚Ä≠  Extremely still control my force with fear,
‚Ä≠  The Cat, and Night-hawk, who much scathe confer
‚Ä≠  On all the outrays where for food I err.
‚Ä≠  Together with the straits-still-keeping trap,  [13]
‚Ä≠  Where lurks deceitful and set-spleen‚Äôd mishap.
‚Ä≠  But most of all the Cat constrains my fear,
‚Ä≠  Being ever apt t‚Äô assault me everywhere;
‚Ä≠  For by that hole that hope says I shall ‚Äôscape,
‚Ä≠  At that hole ever she commits my rape.
‚Ä≠  The best is yet, I eat no pot-herb grass,
‚Ä≠  Nor radishes, nor coloquintidas,
‚Ä≠  Nor still-green beets, nor parsley; which you make
‚Ä≠  Your dainties still, that live upon the lake.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  The Frog replied:  ‚ÄúStranger, your boasts creep all
‚Ä≠  Upon their bellies; though to our lives fall
‚Ä≠  Much more miraculous meats by lake and land,
‚Ä≠  Jove tend‚Äôring our lives with a twofold hand,
‚Ä≠  Enabling us to leap ashore for food,
‚Ä≠  And hide us straight in our retreatful flood.
‚Ä≠  Which, if you will serve, you may prove with ease.
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll take you on my shoulders; which fast seize,
‚Ä≠  If safe arrival at my house y‚Äô intend.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  He stoop‚Äôd, and thither spritely did ascend,
‚Ä≠  Clasping his golden neck, that easy seat
‚Ä≠  Gave to his sally; who was jocund yet,
‚Ä≠  Seeing the safe harbours of the king so near,
‚Ä≠  And he a swimmer so exempt from peer.
‚Ä≠  But when he sunk into the purple wave,
‚Ä≠  He mourn‚Äôd extremely, and did much deprave
‚Ä≠  Unprofitable penitence; his hair
‚Ä≠  Tore by the roots up, labour‚Äôd for the air
‚Ä≠  With his feet fetch‚Äôd up to his belly close;
‚Ä≠  His heart within him panted out repose,
‚Ä≠  For th‚Äô insolent plight in which his state did stand;
‚Ä≠  Sigh‚Äôd bitterly, and long‚Äôd to greet the land,
‚Ä≠  Forced by the dire need of his freezing fear.
‚Ä≠  First, on the waters he his tail did stere,
‚Ä≠  Like to a stern; then drew it like an oar,
‚Ä≠  Still praying the Gods to set him safe ashore;
‚Ä≠  Yet sunk he midst the red waves more and more,
‚Ä≠  And laid a throat out to his utmost height;
‚Ä≠  Yet in forced speech he made his peril slight,
‚Ä≠  And thus his glory with his grievance strove:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúNot in such choice state was the charge of love
‚Ä≠  Borne by the bull, when to the Cretan shore
‚Ä≠  He swum Europa through the wavy roar,
‚Ä≠  As this Frog ferries me, his pallid breast
‚Ä≠  Bravely advancing, and his verdant crest
‚Ä≠  (Submitted to my seat) made my support,
‚Ä≠  Through his white waters, to his royal court.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  But on the sudden did apparance make
‚Ä≠  An horrid spectacle,--a Water-snake
‚Ä≠  Thrusting his freckled neck above the lake.
‚Ä≠  Which seen to both, away Physignathus
‚Ä≠  Dived to his deeps, as no way conscious
‚Ä≠  Of whom he left to perish in his lake,
‚Ä≠  But shunn‚Äôd black fate himself, and let him take
‚Ä≠  The blackest of it; who amidst the fen
‚Ä≠  Swum with his breast up, hands held up in vain,
‚Ä≠  Cried _Peepe_, and perish‚Äôd; sunk the waters oft,
‚Ä≠  And often with his sprawlings came aloft,
‚Ä≠  Yet no way kept down death‚Äôs relentless force,
‚Ä≠  But, full of water, made an heavy corse.
‚Ä≠  Before he perish‚Äôd yet, he threaten‚Äôd thus:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThou lurk‚Äôst not yet from heaven, Physignathus,
‚Ä≠  Though yet thou hid‚Äôst here, that hast cast from thee,
‚Ä≠  As from a rock, the shipwrack‚Äôd life of me,
‚Ä≠  Though thou thyself no better was than I,
‚Ä≠  O worst of things, at any faculty,
‚Ä≠  Wrastling or race.  But, for thy perfidy
‚Ä≠  In this my wrack, Jove bears a wreakful eye;
‚Ä≠  And to the host of Mice thou pains shalt pay,
‚Ä≠  Past all evasion.‚Äù  This his life let say,
‚Ä≠  And left him to the waters.  Him beheld
‚Ä≠  Lichopinax,  [14]  placed in the pleasing field,
‚Ä≠  Who shriek‚Äôd extremely, ran and told the Mice;
‚Ä≠  Who having heard his wat‚Äôry destinies,
‚Ä≠  Pernicious anger pierced the hearts of all,
‚Ä≠  And then their heralds forth they sent to call
‚Ä≠  A council early, at Troxartes‚Äô house,
‚Ä≠  Sad father of this fatal shipwrack‚Äôd Mouse;
‚Ä≠  Whose dead corse upwards swum along the lake,
‚Ä≠  Nor yet, poor wretch, could be enforced to make
‚Ä≠  The shore his harbour, but the mid-main Swum.
‚Ä≠  When now, all haste made, with first morn did come
‚Ä≠  All to set council; in which first rais‚Äôd head
‚Ä≠  Troxartes, angry for his son, and said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúO friends, though I alone may seem to bear
‚Ä≠  All the infortune, yet may all met here
‚Ä≠  Account it their case.  But ‚Äôtis true, I am
‚Ä≠  In chief unhappy, that a triple flame
‚Ä≠  Of life feel put forth, in three famous sons;
‚Ä≠  The first, the chief in our confusions,
‚Ä≠  The Cat, made rape of, caught without his hole:
‚Ä≠  The second, Man, made with a cruel soul,
‚Ä≠  Brought to his ruin with a new-found sleight,
‚Ä≠  And a most wooden engine of deceit,
‚Ä≠  They term a Trap, mere murth‚Äôress of our Mice.
‚Ä≠  The last, that in my love held special price,
‚Ä≠  And his rare mother‚Äôs, this Physignathus
‚Ä≠  (With false pretext of wafting to his house)
‚Ä≠  Strangled in chief deeps of his bloody stream.
‚Ä≠  Come then, haste all, and issue out on them,
‚Ä≠  Our bodies deck‚Äôd in our D√¶dalean arms.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said, his words thrust all up in alarms,
‚Ä≠  And Mars himself, that serves the cure of war,
‚Ä≠  Made all in their appropriates circular.
‚Ä≠  First on each leg the green shales of a bean
‚Ä≠  They closed for boots, that sat exceeding clean;  [15]
‚Ä≠  The shales they broke ope, boothaling by night,
‚Ä≠  And ate the beans; their jacks art exquisite
‚Ä≠  Had shown in them, being cats‚Äô skins, everywhere
‚Ä≠  Quilted with quills; their fenceful bucklers were
‚Ä≠  The middle rounds of can‚Äôsticks; but their spear
‚Ä≠  A huge long needle was, that could not bear
‚Ä≠  The brain of any but be Mars his own
‚Ä≠  Mortal invention; their heads‚Äô arming crown
‚Ä≠  Was vessel to the kernel of a nut.
‚Ä≠  And thus the Mice their powers in armour put.
‚Ä≠     This the Frogs hearing, from the water all
‚Ä≠  Issue to one place, and a council call
‚Ä≠  Of wicked war; consulting what should be
‚Ä≠  Cause to this murmur and strange mutiny.
‚Ä≠  While this was question‚Äôd, near them made his stand
‚Ä≠  An herald with a sceptre in his hand,
‚Ä≠  Embasichytrus  [16]  call‚Äôd, that fetch‚Äôd his kind
‚Ä≠  From Tyroglyphus  [17]  with the mighty mind,
‚Ä≠  Denouncing ill-named war in these high terms:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúO Frogs!  the Mice send threats to you of arms,
‚Ä≠  And bid me bid ye battle and fix‚Äôd fight;
‚Ä≠  Their eyes all wounded with Psicharpax‚Äô sight
‚Ä≠  Floating your waters, whom your king hath kill‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And therefore all prepare for force of field,
‚Ä≠  You that are best born whosoever held.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said, he sever‚Äôd:  his speech firing th‚Äô ears
‚Ä≠  Of all the Mice, but freez‚Äôd the Frogs with fears,
‚Ä≠  Themselves conceiting guilty; whom the king
‚Ä≠  Thus answer‚Äôd, rising,  ‚ÄúFriends!  I did not bring
‚Ä≠  Psicharpax to his end; he, wantoning
‚Ä≠  Upon our waters, practising to swim,
‚Ä≠  Aped us,  [18]  and drown‚Äôd without my sight of him.
‚Ä≠  And yet these worst of vermin accuse me,
‚Ä≠  Though no way guilty.  Come, consider we
‚Ä≠  How we may ruin these deceitful Mice.
‚Ä≠  For my part, I give voice to this advice,
‚Ä≠  As seeming fittest to direct our deeds:
‚Ä≠  Our bodies decking with our arming weeds,
‚Ä≠  Let all our pow‚Äôrs stand rais‚Äôd in steep‚Äôst repose
‚Ä≠  Of all our shore; that, when they charge us close,
‚Ä≠  We may the helms snatch off from all so deckt,
‚Ä≠  Daring our onset, and them all deject
‚Ä≠  Down to our waters; who, not knowing the sleight.
‚Ä≠  To dive our soft deeps, may be strangled straight,
‚Ä≠  And we triumphing may a trophy rear,
‚Ä≠  Of all the Mice that we have slaughter‚Äôd here.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     These words put all in arms; and mallow leaves
‚Ä≠  They drew upon their legs, for arming greaves.  [19]
‚Ä≠  Their curets, broad green beets; their bucklers were
‚Ä≠  Good thick-leaved cabbage, proof ‚Äôgainst any spear;
‚Ä≠  Their spears sharp bulrushes, of which were all
‚Ä≠  Fitted with long ones; their parts capital
‚Ä≠  They hid in subtle cockleshells from blows.
‚Ä≠  And thus all arm‚Äôd, the steepest shores they chose
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô encamp themselves; where lance with lance they lined,
‚Ä≠  And brandish‚Äôd bravely, each Frog full of mind.
‚Ä≠     Then Jove call‚Äôd all Gods in his flaming throne,
‚Ä≠  And show‚Äôd all all this preparation
‚Ä≠  For resolute war; these able soldiers,
‚Ä≠  Many, and great, all shaking lengthful spears,
‚Ä≠  In show like Centaurs, Or the Giants‚Äô host.
‚Ä≠  When, sweetly smiling, he inquired who, most
‚Ä≠  Of all th‚Äô Immortals, pleased to add their aid
‚Ä≠  To Frogs or Mice; and thus to Pallas said:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúO Daughter!  Must not your needs aid these Mice,
‚Ä≠  That, with the odours and meat sacrifice
‚Ä≠  Used in your temple, endless triumphs make,
‚Ä≠  And serve you for your sacred victuals‚Äô sake?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Pallas replied:  ‚ÄúO Father, never I
‚Ä≠  Will aid the Mice in any misery.
‚Ä≠  So many mischiefs by them I have found,
‚Ä≠  Eating the cotton that my distaffs crown‚Äôd,  [20]
‚Ä≠  My lamps still haunting to devour the oil.
‚Ä≠  But that which most my mind eats, is their spoil
‚Ä≠  Made of a veil, that me in much did stand,
‚Ä≠  On which bestowing an elaborate hand,
‚Ä≠  A fine woof working of as pure a thread;
‚Ä≠  Such holes therein their petulancies fed
‚Ä≠  That, putting it to darning, when ‚Äôtwas done,
‚Ä≠  The darner a most dear pay stood upon
‚Ä≠  For his so dear pains, laid down instantly;
‚Ä≠  Or, to forbear, exacted usury.  [21]
‚Ä≠  So, borrowing from my fane the weed I wove,
‚Ä≠  I can by no means th‚Äô usurous darner move
‚Ä≠  To let me have the mantle to restore.
‚Ä≠  And this is it that rubs the angry sore
‚Ä≠  Of my offence took at these petulant Mice.
‚Ä≠  Nor will I yield the Frogs‚Äô wants my supplies,
‚Ä≠  For their infirm minds that no confines keep;
‚Ä≠  For I from war retir‚Äôd, and wanting sleep,
‚Ä≠  All leap‚Äôd ashore in tumult, nor would stay
‚Ä≠  Till one wink seized mine eyes, and so I lay
‚Ä≠  Sleepless, and pain‚Äôd with headache, till first light
‚Ä≠  The cock had crow‚Äôd up.  Therefore, to the fight
‚Ä≠  Let no God go assistant, lest a lance
‚Ä≠  Wound whosoever offers to advance,
‚Ä≠  Or wishes but their aid, that scorn all foes;
‚Ä≠  Should any God‚Äôs access their spirits oppose.
‚Ä≠  Sit we then pleased to see from heaven their fight.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She said, and all Gods join‚Äôd in her delight.
‚Ä≠  And now both hosts to one field drew the jar,
‚Ä≠  Both heralds bearing the ostents of war.
‚Ä≠  And then the wine-gnats,  [22]  that shrill trumpets sound,
‚Ä≠  Terribly rung out the encounter round;
‚Ä≠  Jove thund‚Äôred; all heaven sad war‚Äôs sign resounded.
‚Ä≠     And first Hypsiboas  [23]  Lichenor  [24]  wounded,
‚Ä≠  Standing th‚Äô impression of the first in fight.
‚Ä≠  His lance did in his liver‚Äôs midst alight,
‚Ä≠  Along his belly.  Down he fell; his face
‚Ä≠  His fall on that part sway‚Äôd, and all the grace
‚Ä≠  Of his soft hair fil‚Äôd with disgraceful dust.
‚Ä≠     Then Troglodytes  [25]  his thick javelin thrust
‚Ä≠  In Pelion‚Äôs  [26]  bosom, bearing him to ground,
‚Ä≠  Whom sad death seiz‚Äôd; his soul flew through his wound.
‚Ä≠     Seutl√¶us  [27]  next Embasichytros slew,
‚Ä≠  His heart through-thrusting.  Then Artophagus  [28]  threw
‚Ä≠  His lance at Polyphon,  [29]  and struck him quite
‚Ä≠  Through his mid-belly; down he fell upright,
‚Ä≠  And from his fair limbs took his soul her flight.
‚Ä≠     Limnocharis,  [30]  beholding Polyphon
‚Ä≠  Thus done to death, did, with as round a stone
‚Ä≠  As that the mill turns, Troglodytes wound,
‚Ä≠  Near his mid-neck, ere he his onset found;
‚Ä≠  Whose eyes sad darkness seiz‚Äôd.  Lichenor  [31]  cast
‚Ä≠  A flying dart off, and his aim so placed
‚Ä≠  Upon Limnocharis; that sure he thought  [32]
‚Ä≠  The wound he wish‚Äôd him; nor untruly wrought
‚Ä≠  The dire success, for through his liver flew
‚Ä≠  The fatal lance; which when Crambophagus  [33]  knew,
‚Ä≠  Down the deep waves near shore he, diving, fled;
‚Ä≠  But fled not fate so; the stern enemy fed
‚Ä≠  Death with his life in diving; never more
‚Ä≠  The air he drew in; his vermilion gore
‚Ä≠  Stain‚Äôd all the waters, and along the shore
‚Ä≠  He laid extended; his fat entrails lay
‚Ä≠  (By his small guts‚Äô impulsion) breaking way
‚Ä≠  Out at his wound.  Limnisius  [34]  near the shore
‚Ä≠  Destroy‚Äôd Tyroglyphus.  Which frighted sore
‚Ä≠  The soul of Calaminth,  [35]  seeing coming on,
‚Ä≠  For wreak, Pternoglyphus;  [36]  who got him gone
‚Ä≠  With large leaps to the lake, his target thrown
‚Ä≠  Into the waters.  Hydrocharis  [37]  slew
‚Ä≠  King Pternophagus,  [38]  at whose throat he threw
‚Ä≠  A huge stone, strook it high, and beat his brain
‚Ä≠  Out at his nostrils.  Earth blush‚Äôd with the stain
‚Ä≠  His blood made on her bosom.  For next prise,
‚Ä≠  Lichopinax to death did sacrifice
‚Ä≠  Borboroccetes‚Äô  [39]  faultless faculties;
‚Ä≠  His lance enforced it; darkness closed his eyes.
‚Ä≠  On which when Prassophagus  [40]  cast his look,
‚Ä≠  Cnissodioctes  [41]  by the heels he took,
‚Ä≠  Dragg‚Äôd him to fen from off his native ground,
‚Ä≠  Then seized his throat, and soused him till he drown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠     But now Psicharpax wreaks his fellows‚Äô deaths,
‚Ä≠  And in the bosom of Pelusius  [42]  sheaths,
‚Ä≠  In centre of his liver, his bright lance.
‚Ä≠  He fell before the author of the chance;
‚Ä≠  His soul to hell fled.  Which Pelobates  [43]
‚Ä≠  Taking sad note of, wreakfully did seize
‚Ä≠  His hand‚Äôs gripe full of mud, and all besmear‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His forehead with it so, that scarce appear‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The light to him.  Which certainly incensed
‚Ä≠  His fiery spleen; who with his wreak dispensed
‚Ä≠  No point of time, but rear‚Äôd with his strong hand
‚Ä≠  A stone so massy it oppress‚Äôd the land,
‚Ä≠  And hurl‚Äôd it at him; when below the knee
‚Ä≠  It strook his right leg so impetuously
‚Ä≠  It piecemeal brake it; he the dust did seize,
‚Ä≠  Upwards everted.  But Craugasides  [44]
‚Ä≠  Revenged his death, and at his enemy
‚Ä≠  Discharged a dart that did his point imply
‚Ä≠  In his mid-belly.  All the sharp-pil‚Äôd spear
‚Ä≠  Got after in, and did before it bear
‚Ä≠  His universal entrails to the earth,
‚Ä≠  Soon as his swoln hand gave his jav‚Äôlin birth.
‚Ä≠     Sitophagus,  [45]  beholding the sad sight,
‚Ä≠  Set on the shore, went halting from the fight,
‚Ä≠  Vex‚Äôd with his wounds extremely; and, to make
‚Ä≠  Way from extreme fate, leap‚Äôd into the lake.
‚Ä≠     Troxartes strook, in th‚Äô instep‚Äôs upper part,
‚Ä≠  Physignathus; who (privy to the smart
‚Ä≠  His wound imparted) with his utmost haste
‚Ä≠  Leap‚Äôd to the lake, and fled.  Troxartes cast
‚Ä≠  His eye upon the foe that fell before,
‚Ä≠  And, seeing him half-liv‚Äôd, long‚Äôd again to gore
‚Ä≠  His gutless bosom; and, to kill him quite,
‚Ä≠  Ran fiercely at him.  Which Prassseus‚Äô  [46]  sight
‚Ä≠  Took instant note of, and the first in fight
‚Ä≠  Thrust desp‚Äôrate way through, casting his keen lance
‚Ä≠  Off at Troxartes; whose shield turn‚Äôd th‚Äô advance
‚Ä≠  The sharp head made, and check‚Äôd the mortal chance.
‚Ä≠     Amongst the Mice fought an egregious
‚Ä≠  Young springall, and a close-encount‚Äôring Mouse,
‚Ä≠  Pure Artepibulus‚Äôs  [47]  dear descent;
‚Ä≠  A prince that Mars himself show‚Äôd where he went.
‚Ä≠  (Call‚Äôd Meridarpax,  [48]) of so huge a might,
‚Ä≠  That only he still domineer‚Äôd in fight
‚Ä≠  Of all the Mouse-host.  He advancing close
‚Ä≠  Up to the lake, past all the rest arose
‚Ä≠  In glorious object, and made vaunt that he
‚Ä≠  Came to depopulate all the progeny
‚Ä≠  Of Frogs, affected with the lance of war.
‚Ä≠  And certainly he had put on as far
‚Ä≠  As he advanced his vaunt, he was endu‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With so unmatch‚Äôd a force and fortitude,
‚Ä≠  Had not the Father both of Gods and men
‚Ä≠  Instantly known it, and the Frogs, even then
‚Ä≠  Given up to ruin, rescued with remorse.
‚Ä≠  Who, his head moving, thus began discourse:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúNo mean amaze affects me, to behold
‚Ä≠  Prince Meridarpax rage so uncontroll‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  In thirst of Frog-blood, all along the lake.
‚Ä≠  Come therefore still, and all addression make,
‚Ä≠  Despatching Pallas, with tumultuous Mars,
‚Ä≠  Down to the field, to make him leave the wars,
‚Ä≠  How potently soever he be said  [49]
‚Ä≠  Where he attempts once to uphold his head.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Mars answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúO Jove, neither She nor I,
‚Ä≠  With both our aids, can keep depopulacy
‚Ä≠  From off the Frogs!  And therefore arm we all,
‚Ä≠  Even thy lance letting brandish to his call
‚Ä≠  From off the field, that from the field withdrew
‚Ä≠  The Titanois, the Titanois that slew,
‚Ä≠  Though most exempt from match of all earth‚Äôs Seeds,
‚Ä≠  So great and so inaccessible deeds
‚Ä≠  It hath proclaim‚Äôd to men; bound hand and foot
‚Ä≠  The vast Enceladus; and rac‚Äôd by th‚Äô root
‚Ä≠  The race of upland Giants.‚Äù  This speech past,
‚Ä≠  Saturnius a smoking lightning cast
‚Ä≠  Amongst the armies, thund‚Äôring then so sore,
‚Ä≠  That with a rapting circumflex he bore
‚Ä≠  All huge heaven over.  But the terrible ire
‚Ä≠  Of his dart, sent abroad, all wrapt in fire,
‚Ä≠  (Which certainly his very finger was)
‚Ä≠  Amazed both Mice and Frogs.  Yet soon let pass
‚Ä≠  Was all this by the Mice, who much the more
‚Ä≠  Burn‚Äôd in desire t‚Äô exterminate the store
‚Ä≠  Of all those lance-loved soldiers.  Which had been,
‚Ä≠  If from Olympus Jove‚Äôs eye had not seen
‚Ä≠  The Frogs with pity, and with instant speed
‚Ä≠  Sent them assistants.  Who, ere any heed
‚Ä≠  Was given to their approach, came crawling on
‚Ä≠  With anvils on their backs, that, beat upon  [50]
‚Ä≠  Never so much, are never wearied yet;
‚Ä≠  Crook-paw‚Äôd, and wrested on with foul cloven feet,
‚Ä≠  Tongues in their mouths,  [51]  brick-back‚Äôd, all over bone,
‚Ä≠  Broad shoulder‚Äôd, whence a ruddy yellow shone,
‚Ä≠  Distorted, and small-thigh‚Äôd; had eyes that saw
‚Ä≠  Out at their bosoms; twice four feet did draw
‚Ä≠  About their bodies; strong-neck‚Äôd, whence did rise
‚Ä≠  Two heads; nor could to any hand be prise;
‚Ä≠  They call them lobsters; that ate from the Mice
‚Ä≠  Their tails, their feet, and hands, and wrested all
‚Ä≠  Their lances from them, so that cold appall
‚Ä≠  The wretches put in rout, past all return.
‚Ä≠  And now the Fount of Light forbore to burn
‚Ä≠  Above the earth; when, which men‚Äôs laws commend,
‚Ä≠  Our battle in one day took absolute end.

‚Ä≠  THE END OF HOMER‚ÄôS BATTLE OF FROGS AND MICE.

‚Ä≠  HYMNS

‚Ä≠  A HYMN TO APOLLO

‚Ä≠  I will remember and express the praise
‚Ä≠  Of heaven‚Äôs Far-darter, the fair King of days,
‚Ä≠  Whom even the Gods themselves fear when he goes
‚Ä≠  Through Jove's high house; and when his goodly bows
‚Ä≠  He goes to bend, all from their thrones arise,
‚Ä≠  And cluster near, t‚Äô admire his faculties.
‚Ä≠  Only Latona stirs not from her seat
‚Ä≠  Close by the Thund‚Äôrer, till her Son‚Äôs retreat
‚Ä≠  From his dread archery; but then she goes,
‚Ä≠  Slackens his string, and shuts his quiver close,
‚Ä≠  And (having taken to her hand his bow,
‚Ä≠  From off his able shoulders) doth bestow
‚Ä≠  Upon a pin of gold the glorious tiller,
‚Ä≠  The pin of gold fix‚Äôd in his father‚Äôs pillar.
‚Ä≠     Then doth She to his throne his state uphold,
‚Ä≠  Where his great Father, in a cup of gold,
‚Ä≠  Serves him with nectar, and shows all the grace
‚Ä≠  Of his great son.  Then th‚Äô other Gods take place;
‚Ä≠  His gracious mother glorying to bear
‚Ä≠  So great an archer, and a son so clear.
‚Ä≠     All hail, O blest Latona!  to bring forth
‚Ä≠  An issue of such all-out-shining worth,
‚Ä≠  Royal Apollo, and the Queen that loves
‚Ä≠  The hurls of darts.  She in th‚Äô Ortygian groves,
‚Ä≠  And he in cliffy Delos, leaning on
‚Ä≠  The lofty Oros, and being built upon
‚Ä≠  By Cynthus‚Äô prominent, that his head rears
‚Ä≠  Close to the palm that Inops‚Äô fluent cheers.
‚Ä≠     How shall I praise thee, far being worthiest praise,
‚Ä≠  O Ph≈ìbus?  To whose worth the law of lays
‚Ä≠  In all kinds is ascrib‚Äôd, if feeding flocks
‚Ä≠  By continent or isle.  All eminent‚Äôst rocks
‚Ä≠  Did sing for joy, hill-tops, and floods in song
‚Ä≠  Did break their billows, as they flow‚Äôd along
‚Ä≠  To serve the sea; the shores, the seas, and all
‚Ä≠  Did sing as soon as from the lap did fall
‚Ä≠  Of blest Latona thee the joy of man.
‚Ä≠  Her child-bed made the mountain Cynthian
‚Ä≠  In rocky Delos, the sea-circled isle,
‚Ä≠  On whose all sides the black seas brake their pile,
‚Ä≠  And overflow‚Äôd for joy, so frank a gale
‚Ä≠  The singing winds did on their waves exhale.
‚Ä≠     Here born, all mortals live in thy commands,
‚Ä≠  Whoever Crete holds, Athens, or the strands
‚Ä≠  Of th‚Äô isle √Ügina, or the famous land
‚Ä≠  For ships (Eub≈ìa), or Eresia,
‚Ä≠  Or Peparethus bord‚Äôring on the sea,
‚Ä≠  √Ügas, or Athos that doth Thrace divide
‚Ä≠  And Macedon; or Pelion, with the pride
‚Ä≠  Of his high forehead; or the Samian isle,
‚Ä≠  That likewise lies near Thrace; or Scyrus‚Äô soil;
‚Ä≠  Ida‚Äôs steep tops; or all that Phocis fill;
‚Ä≠  Or Autocanes, with the heaven-high hill;
‚Ä≠  Or populous Imber; Lemnos without ports;
‚Ä≠  Or Lesbos, fit for the divine resorts;
‚Ä≠  And sacred soil of blest √Üolion;
‚Ä≠  Or Chios that exceeds comparison
‚Ä≠  For fruitfulness; with all the isles that lie
‚Ä≠  Embrac‚Äôd with seas; Mimas, with rocks so high;
‚Ä≠  Or lofty-crown‚Äôd Corycius; or the bright
‚Ä≠  Charos; or √Üsag√¶us‚Äô dazzling height;
‚Ä≠  Or watery Samos; Mycale, that bears
‚Ä≠  Her brows even with the circles of the spheres;
‚Ä≠  Miletus; Cous, that the city is
‚Ä≠  Of voice-divided-choice humanities;
‚Ä≠  High Cnidus; Carpathus, still strook with wind;
‚Ä≠  Naxos, and Paros; and the rocky-min‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Rugged Rhen√¶a.  Yet through all these parts
‚Ä≠  Latona, great-grown with the King of darts,
‚Ä≠  Travell‚Äôd; and tried if any would become
‚Ä≠  To her dear birth an hospitable home.
‚Ä≠  All which extremely trembled, shook with fear,
‚Ä≠  Nor durst endure so high a birth to bear
‚Ä≠  In their free states, though, for it, they became
‚Ä≠  Never so fruitful; till the reverend Dame
‚Ä≠  Ascended Delos, and her soil did seize
‚Ä≠  With these wing‚Äôd words:  ‚ÄúO Delos!  Wouldst thou please
‚Ä≠  To be my son Apollo‚Äôs native seat,
‚Ä≠  And build a wealthy fane to one so great,
‚Ä≠  No one shall blame or question thy kind deed.
‚Ä≠  Nor think I, thou dost sheep or oxen feed
‚Ä≠  In any such store, or in vines exceed,
‚Ä≠  Nor bring‚Äôst forth such innumerable plants,
‚Ä≠  Which often make the rich inhabitants
‚Ä≠  Careless of Deity.  If thou then shouldst rear
‚Ä≠  A fane to Ph≈ìbus, all men would confer
‚Ä≠  Whole hecatombs of beeves for sacrifice,
‚Ä≠  Still thronging hither; and to thee would rise
‚Ä≠  Ever unmeasur‚Äôd odours, shouldst thou long
‚Ä≠  Nourish thy King thus; and from foreign wrong
‚Ä≠  The Gods would guard thee; which thine own address
‚Ä≠  Can never compass for thy barrenness.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     She said, and Delos joy‚Äôd, replying thus:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúMost happy sister of Saturnius!
‚Ä≠  I gladly would with all means entertain
‚Ä≠  The King your son, being now despised of men,
‚Ä≠  But should be honour‚Äôd with the greatest then.
‚Ä≠  Yet this I fear, nor will conceal from thee:
‚Ä≠  Your son, some say, will author misery
‚Ä≠  In many kinds, as being to sustain
‚Ä≠  A mighty empire over Gods and men,
‚Ä≠  Upon the holy-gift-giver the Earth.
‚Ä≠  And bitterly I fear that, when his birth
‚Ä≠  Gives him the sight of my so barren soil,
‚Ä≠  He will contemn, and give me up to spoil,
‚Ä≠  Enforce the sea to me, that ever will
‚Ä≠  Oppress my heart with many a wat‚Äôry hill.
‚Ä≠  And therefore let him choose some other land,
‚Ä≠  Where he shall please, to build at his command
‚Ä≠  Temple and grove, set thick with many a tree.
‚Ä≠  For wretched polypuses breed in me
‚Ä≠  Retiring chambers, and black sea-calves den
‚Ä≠  In my poor soil, for penury of men.
‚Ä≠  And yet, O Goddess, wouldst thou please to swear
‚Ä≠  The Gods‚Äô great oath to me, before thou bear
‚Ä≠  Thy blessed son here, that thou wilt erect
‚Ä≠  A fane to him, to render the effect
‚Ä≠  Of men‚Äôs demands to them before they fall,
‚Ä≠  Then will thy son‚Äôs renown be general,
‚Ä≠  Men will his name in such variety call,
‚Ä≠  And I shall then be glad his birth to bear.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said, the Gods‚Äô great oath she thus did swear:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúKnow this, O Earth!  broad heaven‚Äôs inferior sphere,
‚Ä≠  And of black Styx the most infernal lake,
‚Ä≠  (Which is the gravest oath the Gods can take)
‚Ä≠  That here shall ever rise to Ph≈ìbus‚Äô name
‚Ä≠  An odorous fane and altar; and thy fame
‚Ä≠  Honour, past all isles else, shall see him employ‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  Her oath thus took and ended, Delos joy‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  in mighty measure that she should become
‚Ä≠  To far-shot Ph≈ìbus‚Äô birth the famous home.
‚Ä≠     Latona then nine days and nights did fall
‚Ä≠  In hopeless labour; at whose birth were all
‚Ä≠  Heaven‚Äôs most supreme and worthy Goddesses,
‚Ä≠  Dione, Rh√¶a, and th‚Äô Exploratress
‚Ä≠  Themis, and Amphitrite that will be
‚Ä≠  Pursu‚Äôd with sighs still; every Deity,
‚Ä≠  Except the snowy-wristed wife of Jove,
‚Ä≠  Who held her moods aloft, and would not move;
‚Ä≠  Only Lucina (to whose virtue vows
‚Ä≠  Each childbirth patient) heard not of her throes,
‚Ä≠  But sat, by Juno‚Äôs counsel, on the brows
‚Ä≠  Of broad Olympus, wrapp‚Äôd in clouds of gold.
‚Ä≠  Whom Jove‚Äôs proud wife in envy did withhold,
‚Ä≠  Because bright-lock‚Äôd Latona was to bear
‚Ä≠  A son so faultless and in force so clear.
‚Ä≠  The rest Thaumantia sent before, to bring
‚Ä≠  Lucina to release the envied king,
‚Ä≠  Assuring her, that they would straight confer
‚Ä≠  A carcanet, nine cubits long, on her,
‚Ä≠  All woven with wires of gold.  But charg‚Äôd her, then,
‚Ä≠  To call apart from th‚Äô ivory-wristed Queen
‚Ä≠  The childbirth-guiding Goddess, for just fear
‚Ä≠  Lest, her charge utter‚Äôd in Saturnia‚Äôs ear,
‚Ä≠  She, after, might dissuade her from descent.
‚Ä≠  When wind-swift-footed Iris knew th‚Äô intent
‚Ä≠  Of th‚Äô other Goddesses, away she went,
‚Ä≠  And instantly she pass‚Äôd the infinite space
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTwixt earth and heaven; when, coming to the place
‚Ä≠  Where dwelt th‚Äô Immortals, straight without the gate
‚Ä≠  She gat Lucina, and did all relate
‚Ä≠  The Goddesses commanded, and inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To all that they demanded her dear mind.
‚Ä≠  And on their way they went, like those two doves
‚Ä≠  That, walking highways, every shadow moves
‚Ä≠  Up from the earth, forc‚Äôd with their natural fear.
‚Ä≠  When ent‚Äôring Delos, She, that is so dear
‚Ä≠  To dames in labour, made Latona straight
‚Ä≠  Prone to delivery, and to wield the weight
‚Ä≠  Of her dear burthen with a world of ease.
‚Ä≠  When, with her fair hand, she a palm did seize,
‚Ä≠  And, staying her by it, stuck her tender knees
‚Ä≠  Amidst the soft mead, that did smile beneath
‚Ä≠  Her sacred labour; and the child did breathe
‚Ä≠  The air in th‚Äô instant.  All the Goddesses
‚Ä≠  Brake in kind tears and shrieks for her quick ease,
‚Ä≠  And thee, O archer Ph≈ìbus, with waves clear
‚Ä≠  Wash‚Äôd sweetly over, swaddled with sincere
‚Ä≠  And spotless swathbands; and made then to flow
‚Ä≠  About thy breast a mantle, white as snow,
‚Ä≠  Fine, and new made; and cast a veil of gold
‚Ä≠  Over thy forehead.  Nor yet forth did hold
‚Ä≠  Thy mother for thy food her golden breast,
‚Ä≠  But Themis, in supply of it, address‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Lovely Ambrosia, and drunk off to thee
‚Ä≠  A bowl of nectar, interchangeably
‚Ä≠  With her immortal fingers serving thine.
‚Ä≠  And when, O Ph≈ìbus, that eternal wine
‚Ä≠  Thy taste had relish‚Äôd, and that food divine,
‚Ä≠  No golden swathband longer could contain
‚Ä≠  Thy panting bosom; all that would constrain
‚Ä≠  Thy soon-eas‚Äôd Godhead, every feeble chain
‚Ä≠  Of earthy child-rites, flew in sunder all.
‚Ä≠  And then didst thou thus to the Deities call:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúLet there be given me my lov‚Äôd lute and bow,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll prophesy to men, and make them know
‚Ä≠  Jove‚Äôs perfect counsels.‚Äù  This said, up did fly
‚Ä≠  From broad-way‚Äôd Earth the unshorn Deity,
‚Ä≠  Far-shot Apollo.  All th‚Äô Immortals stood
‚Ä≠  In steep amaze to see Latona‚Äôs brood.
‚Ä≠  All Delos, looking on him, all with gold
‚Ä≠  Was loaden straight, and joy‚Äôd to be extoll‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By great Latona so, that she decreed
‚Ä≠  Her barrenness should bear the fruitful‚Äôst seed
‚Ä≠  Of all the isles and continents of earth,
‚Ä≠  And lov‚Äôd her from her heart so for her birth.
‚Ä≠  For so she flourish‚Äôd, as a hill that stood
‚Ä≠  Crown‚Äôd with the flow‚Äôr of an abundant wood.
‚Ä≠  And thou, O Ph≈ìbus, bearing in thy hand
‚Ä≠  Thy silver bow, walk‚Äôst over every land,
‚Ä≠  Sometimes ascend‚Äôst the rough-hewn rocky hill
‚Ä≠  Of desolate Cynthus, and sometimes tak‚Äôst will
‚Ä≠  To visit islands, and the plumps of men.
‚Ä≠  And many a temple, all ways, men ordain
‚Ä≠  To thy bright Godhead; groves, made dark with trees,
‚Ä≠  And never shorn, to hide the Deities,
‚Ä≠  All high-lov‚Äôd prospects, all the steepest brows
‚Ä≠  Of far-seen hills, and every flood that flows
‚Ä≠  Forth to the sea, are dedicate to thee.
‚Ä≠  But most of all thy mind‚Äôs alacrity
‚Ä≠  Is rais‚Äôd with Delos; since, to fill thy fane,
‚Ä≠  There flocks so many an Ionian,
‚Ä≠  With ample gowns that flow down to their feet,
‚Ä≠  With all their children, and the reverend sweet
‚Ä≠  Of all their pious wives.  And these are they
‚Ä≠  That (mindful of thee) even thy Deity
‚Ä≠  Render more spritely with their champion fight,
‚Ä≠  Dances, and songs, perform‚Äôd to glorious sight,
‚Ä≠  Once having publish‚Äôd, and proclaim‚Äôd their strife.
‚Ä≠  And these are acted with such exquisite life
‚Ä≠  That one would say,  ‚ÄúNow, the Ionian strains
‚Ä≠  Are turn‚Äôd Immortals, nor know what age means.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  His mind would take such pleasure from his eye,
‚Ä≠  To see them serv‚Äôd by all mortality,
‚Ä≠  Their men so human, women so well grac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Their ships so swift, their riches so increas‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Since thy observance, who, being all before
‚Ä≠  Thy opposites, were all despis‚Äôd and poor.
‚Ä≠  And to all these this absolute wonder add,
‚Ä≠  Whose praise shall render all posterities glad:
‚Ä≠  The Delian virgins are thy handmaids all,
‚Ä≠  And, since they serv‚Äôd Apollo, jointly fall
‚Ä≠  Before Latona, and Diana too,
‚Ä≠  In sacred service, and do therefore know
‚Ä≠  How to make mention of the ancient trims
‚Ä≠  Of men and women, in their well-made hymns,
‚Ä≠  And soften barbarous nations with their songs,
‚Ä≠  Being able all to speak the several tongues
‚Ä≠  Of foreign nations, and to imitate
‚Ä≠  Their musics there, with art so fortunate
‚Ä≠  That one would say, there everyone did speak,
‚Ä≠  And all their tunes in natural accents break,
‚Ä≠  Their songs so well compos‚Äôd are, and their art
‚Ä≠  To answer all sounds is of such desert.
‚Ä≠     But come, Latona, and thou King of flames,
‚Ä≠  With Ph≈ìbe, rect‚Äôress of chaste thoughts in dames
‚Ä≠  Let me salute ye, and your graces call
‚Ä≠  Hereafter to my just memorial.
‚Ä≠     And you, O Delian virgins, do me grace,
‚Ä≠  When any stranger of our earthy race,
‚Ä≠  Whose restless life affliction hath in chace,
‚Ä≠  Shall hither come and question you, who is,
‚Ä≠  To your chaste ears, of choicest faculties
‚Ä≠  In sacred poesy, and with most right
‚Ä≠  Is author of your absolut‚Äôst delight,
‚Ä≠  Ye shall yourselves do all the right ye can
‚Ä≠  To answer for our name:--‚ÄúThe sightless man
‚Ä≠  Of stony Chios.  All whose poems shall
‚Ä≠  In all last ages stand for capital.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This for your own sakes I desire, for I
‚Ä≠  Will propagate mine own precedency
‚Ä≠  As far as earth shall well-built cities bear,
‚Ä≠  Or human conversation is held dear,
‚Ä≠  Not with my praise direct, but praises due,
‚Ä≠  And men shall credit it, because ‚Äôtis true.
‚Ä≠     However, I‚Äôll not cease the praise I vow
‚Ä≠  To far-shot Ph≈ìbus with the silver bow,
‚Ä≠  Whom lovely-hair‚Äôd Latona gave the light.
‚Ä≠  O King!  both Lycia is in rule thy right,
‚Ä≠  Fair M≈ìony, and the maritimal
‚Ä≠  Miletus, wish‚Äôd to be the seat of all.
‚Ä≠     But chiefly Delos, girt with billows round,
‚Ä≠  Thy most respected empire doth resound.
‚Ä≠  Where thou to Pythus went‚Äôst, to answer there,
‚Ä≠  As soon as thou wert born, the burning ear
‚Ä≠  Of many a far-come, to hear future deeds,
‚Ä≠  Clad in divine and odoriferous weeds,
‚Ä≠  And with thy golden fescue play‚Äôdst upon
‚Ä≠  Thy hollow harp, that sounds to heaven set gone.
‚Ä≠     Then to Olympus swift as thought he flew,
‚Ä≠  To Jove‚Äôs high house, and had a retinue
‚Ä≠  Of Gods t‚Äô attend him; and then straight did fall
‚Ä≠  To study of the harp, and harpsical,
‚Ä≠  All th‚Äô Immortals.  To whom every Muse
‚Ä≠  With ravishing voices did their answers use,
‚Ä≠  Singing th‚Äô eternal deeds of Deity,
‚Ä≠  And from their hands what hells of misery
‚Ä≠  Poor humans suffer, living desperate quite,
‚Ä≠  And not an art they have, wit, or deceit,
‚Ä≠  Can make them manage any act aright,
‚Ä≠  Nor find, with all the soul they can engage,
‚Ä≠  A salve for death, or remedy for age.
‚Ä≠     But here the fair-hair‚Äôd Graces, the wise Hours,
‚Ä≠  Harmonia, Hebe, and sweet Venus‚Äô pow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  Danc‚Äôd, and each other‚Äôs palm to palm did cling.
‚Ä≠  And with these danc‚Äôd not a deformed thing,
‚Ä≠  No forespoke dwarf, nor downward witherling,
‚Ä≠  But all with wond‚Äôrous goodly forms were deckt,
‚Ä≠  And mov‚Äôd with beauties of unpriz‚Äôd aspect.
‚Ä≠     Dart-dear Diana, even with Ph≈ìbus bred,
‚Ä≠  Danc‚Äôd likewise there; and Mars a march did tread
‚Ä≠  With that brave bevy.  In whose consort fell
‚Ä≠  Argicides, th‚Äô ingenious sentinel.
‚Ä≠  Ph≈ìbus-Apollo touch‚Äôd his lute to them
‚Ä≠  Sweetly and softly, a most glorious beam
‚Ä≠  Casting about him, as he danc‚Äôd and play‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And even his feet were all with rays array‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  His weed and all of a most curious trim
‚Ä≠  With no less lustre grac‚Äôd and circled him.
‚Ä≠     By these Latona, with a hair that shin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Like burnish‚Äôd gold, and, with the mighty mind;
‚Ä≠  Heaven‚Äôs counsellor, Jove, sat with delightsome eyes;
‚Ä≠  To see their son new rank‚Äôd with Deities.
‚Ä≠     How shall I praise thee, then, that art all praise?
‚Ä≠  Amongst the brides shall I thy Deity raise?
‚Ä≠  Or being in love, when sad thou went‚Äôst to woo
‚Ä≠  The virgin Aza, and didst overthrow
‚Ä≠  The even-with-Gods, Elation‚Äôs mighty seed,
‚Ä≠  That had of goodly horse so brave a breed,
‚Ä≠  And Phorbas, son of sovereign Triopus,
‚Ä≠  Valiant Leucippus, and Ereutheus,
‚Ä≠  And Triopus himself with equal fall,
‚Ä≠  Thou but on foot, and they on horseback all?
‚Ä≠     Or shall I sing thee, as thou first didst grace
‚Ä≠  Earth with thy foot, to find thee forth a place
‚Ä≠  Fit to pronounce thy oracles to men?
‚Ä≠  First from Olympus thou alightedst then
‚Ä≠  Into Pieria, passing all the land
‚Ä≠  Of fruitless Lesbos, chok‚Äôd with drifts of sand,
‚Ä≠  The Magnets likewise, and the Perrh√¶bes;
‚Ä≠  And to Iolcus variedst thy access,
‚Ä≠  Cen√¶us‚Äô tops ascending, that their base
‚Ä≠  Make bright Eub≈ìa, being of ships the grace,
‚Ä≠  And fix‚Äôd thy fair stand in Lelantus‚Äô field,
‚Ä≠  That did not yet thy mind‚Äôs contentment yield
‚Ä≠  To raise a fane on, and a sacred grove.
‚Ä≠  Passing Euripus then, thou mad‚Äôst remove
‚Ä≠  Up to earth‚Äôs ever-green and holiest hill.
‚Ä≠  Yet swiftly thence, too, thou transcendedst still
‚Ä≠  To Mycalessus, and didst touch upon
‚Ä≠  Teumessus, apt to make green couches on,
‚Ä≠  And flowery field-beds.  Then thy progress found
‚Ä≠  Thebes out, whose soil with only woods was crown‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  For yet was sacred Thebes no human seat,
‚Ä≠  And therefore were no paths nor highways beat
‚Ä≠  On her free bosom, that flows now with wheat,
‚Ä≠  But then she only wore on it a wood.
‚Ä≠  From hence (even loth to part, because it stood
‚Ä≠  Fit for thy service) thou putt‚Äôst on remove
‚Ä≠  To green Onchestus, Neptune‚Äôs glorious grove,
‚Ä≠  Where new-tam‚Äôd horse, bred, nourish nerves so rare
‚Ä≠  That still they frolic, though they travell‚Äôd are
‚Ä≠  Never so sore, and hurry after them
‚Ä≠  Most heavy coaches, but are so extreme
‚Ä≠  (In usual travel) fiery and free,
‚Ä≠  That though their coachman ne‚Äôer so masterly
‚Ä≠  Governs their courages, he sometimes must
‚Ä≠  Forsake his seat, and give their spirits their lust,
‚Ä≠  When after them their empty coach they draw,
‚Ä≠  Foaming, and neighing, quite exempt from awe.
‚Ä≠  And if their coachman guide through any grove
‚Ä≠  Unshorn, and vow‚Äôd to any Deity‚Äôs love,
‚Ä≠  The lords encoach‚Äôd leap out, and all their care
‚Ä≠  Use to allay their fires, with speaking fair
‚Ä≠  Stroking and trimming them, and in some queach,
‚Ä≠  Or strength of shade, within their nearest reach,
‚Ä≠  Reining them up, invoke the deified King
‚Ä≠  Of that unshorn and everlasting spring,
‚Ä≠  And leave them then to her preserving hands,
‚Ä≠  Who is the Fate that there the God commands.
‚Ä≠  And this was first the sacred fashion there.
‚Ä≠  From hence thou went‚Äôst, O thou in shafts past peer,
‚Ä≠  And found‚Äôst Cephissus with thy all-seeing beams,
‚Ä≠  Whose flood affects so many silver streams,
‚Ä≠  And from Lil√¶us pours so bright a wave.
‚Ä≠  Yet forth thy foot flew, and thy fair eyes gave
‚Ä≠  The view of Ocale the rich in tow‚Äôrs;
‚Ä≠  Then to Amartus that abounds in flow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  Then to Delphusa putt‚Äôst thy progress on,
‚Ä≠  Whose blessed soil nought harmful breeds upon;
‚Ä≠  And there thy pleasure would a fane adorn,
‚Ä≠  And nourish woods whose shades should ne‚Äôer be shorn.
‚Ä≠  Where this thou told‚Äôst her, standing to her close:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúDelphusa, here I entertain suppose
‚Ä≠  To build a far-fam‚Äôd temple, and ordain
‚Ä≠  An oracle t‚Äô inform the minds of men,
‚Ä≠  Who shall for ever offer to my love
‚Ä≠  Whole hecatombs; even all the men that move
‚Ä≠  In rich Peloponnesus, and all those
‚Ä≠  Of Europe, and the isles the seas enclose,
‚Ä≠  Whom future search of acts and beings brings.
‚Ä≠  To whom I‚Äôll prophesy the truths of things
‚Ä≠  In that rich temple where my oracle sings.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, the All-bounds-reacher, with his bow,
‚Ä≠  The fane‚Äôs divine foundations did foreshow;
‚Ä≠  Ample they were, and did huge length impart,
‚Ä≠  With a continuate tenour, full of art.
‚Ä≠  But when Delphusa look‚Äôd into his end,
‚Ä≠  Her heart grew angry, and did thus extend
‚Ä≠  Itself to Ph≈ìbus:  ‚ÄúPh≈ìbus, since thy mind
‚Ä≠  A far-fam‚Äôd fane hath in itself design‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To bear an oracle to men in me,
‚Ä≠  That hecatombs may put in fire to thee,
‚Ä≠  This let me tell thee, and impose for stay
‚Ä≠  Upon thy purpose:  Th‚Äô inarticulate neigh
‚Ä≠  Of fire-hov‚Äôd horse will ever disobey
‚Ä≠  Thy numerous ear, and mules will for their drink
‚Ä≠  Trouble my sacred springs, and I should think
‚Ä≠  That any of the human race had rather
‚Ä≠  See here the hurries of rich coaches gather,
‚Ä≠  And hear the haughty neighs of swift-hov‚Äôd horse,
‚Ä≠  Than in his pleasure‚Äôs place convert recourse
‚Ä≠  T‚Äôa mighty temple; and his wealth bestow
‚Ä≠  On pieties, where his sports may freely flow,
‚Ä≠  Or see huge wealth that he shall never owe.
‚Ä≠  And, therefore, wouldst thou hear my free advice,--
‚Ä≠  Though mightier far thou art, and much more wise,
‚Ä≠  O king, than I, thy pow‚Äôr being great‚Äôst of all
‚Ä≠  In Crissa, underneath the bosom‚Äôs fall
‚Ä≠  Of steep Parnassus,--let thy mind be given
‚Ä≠  To set thee up a fane, where never driven
‚Ä≠  Shall glorious coaches be, nor horses‚Äô neighs
‚Ä≠  Storm near thy well-built altars, but thy praise
‚Ä≠  Let the fair race of pious humans bring
‚Ä≠  Into thy fane, that Io-p√¶ans sing.
‚Ä≠  And those gifts only let thy deified mind
‚Ä≠  Be circularly pleas‚Äôd with, being the kind
‚Ä≠  And fair burnt-offerings that true Deities bind.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  With this his mind she altered, though she spake
‚Ä≠  Not for his good, but her own glory‚Äôs sake.
‚Ä≠     From hence, O Ph≈ìbus, first thou mad‚Äôst retreat,
‚Ä≠  And of the Phlegians reached the walled seat,
‚Ä≠  Inhabited with contumelious men,
‚Ä≠  Who, slighting Jove, took up their dwellings then
‚Ä≠  Within a large cave, near Cephissus‚Äô lake.
‚Ä≠  Hence, swiftly moving, thou all speed didst make
‚Ä≠  Up to the tops intended, and the ground
‚Ä≠  Of Crissa, under the-with-snow-still-crown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Parnassus, reach‚Äôd, whose face affects the West;
‚Ä≠  Above which hangs a rock, that still seems prest
‚Ä≠  To fall upon it, through whose breast doth run
‚Ä≠  A rocky cave, near which the King the Sun
‚Ä≠  Cast to contrive a temple to his mind,
‚Ä≠  And said,  ‚ÄúNow here stands my conceit inclin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To build a famous fane, where still shall be
‚Ä≠  An oracle to men, that still to me
‚Ä≠  Shall offer absolute hecatombs, as well
‚Ä≠  Those that in rich Peloponnesus dwell
‚Ä≠  As those of Europe, and the isles that lie
‚Ä≠  Wall‚Äôd with the sea, that all their pains apply
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô employ my counsels.  To all which will I
‚Ä≠  True secrets tell, by way of prophecy,
‚Ä≠  In my rich temple, that shall ever be
‚Ä≠  An oracle to all posterity.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said, the fane‚Äôs form he did straight present,
‚Ä≠  Ample, and of a length of great extent;
‚Ä≠  In which Trophonius and Agamede,
‚Ä≠  Who of Erginus were the famous seed,
‚Ä≠  Impos‚Äôd the stony entry, and the heart
‚Ä≠  Of every God had for their excellent art.
‚Ä≠     About the temple dwelt of human name
‚Ä≠  Unnumber‚Äôd nations, it acquired such fame,
‚Ä≠  Being all of stone, built for eternal date.
‚Ä≠  And near it did a fountain propagate
‚Ä≠  A fair stream far away; when Jove‚Äôs bright seed,
‚Ä≠  The King Apollo, with an arrow, freed
‚Ä≠  From his strong string, destroy‚Äôd the Dragoness
‚Ä≠  That wonder nourish‚Äôd, being of such excess
‚Ä≠  In size, and horridness of monstrous shape,
‚Ä≠  That on the forc‚Äôd earth she wrought many a rape,
‚Ä≠  Many a spoil made on it, many an ill
‚Ä≠  On crook-haunch‚Äôd herds brought, being impurpled still
‚Ä≠  With blood of all sorts; having undergone
‚Ä≠  The charge of Juno, with the golden throne,
‚Ä≠  To nourish Typhon, the abhorr‚Äôd affright
‚Ä≠  And bane of mortals, whom into the light
‚Ä≠  Saturnia brought forth, being incensed with Jove,
‚Ä≠  Because the most renown‚Äôd fruit of his love
‚Ä≠  (Pallas) he got, and shook out of his brain.
‚Ä≠  For which majestic Juno did complain
‚Ä≠  In this kind to the Bless‚Äôd Court of the skies:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúKnow all ye sex-distinguish‚Äôd Deities,
‚Ä≠  That Jove, assembler of the cloudy throng,
‚Ä≠  Begins with me first, and affects with wrong
‚Ä≠  My right in him, made by himself his wife,
‚Ä≠  That knows and does the honour‚Äôd marriage life
‚Ä≠  All honest offices; and yet hath he
‚Ä≠  Unduly got, without my company,
‚Ä≠  Blue-eyed Minerva, who of all the sky
‚Ä≠  Of blest Immortals is the absolute grace;
‚Ä≠  Where I have brought into the Heavenly Race
‚Ä≠  A son, both taken in his feet and head,
‚Ä≠  So ugly, and so far from worth my bed,
‚Ä≠  That, ravish‚Äôd into hand, I took and threw
‚Ä≠  Down to the vast sea his detested view;
‚Ä≠  Where Nereus‚Äô daughter, Thetis, who her way
‚Ä≠  With silver feet makes, and the fair array
‚Ä≠  Of her bright sisters, saved, and took to guard.
‚Ä≠  But, would to heaven, another yet were spared
‚Ä≠  The like grace of his godhead!  Crafty mate,
‚Ä≠  What other scape canst thou excogitate?
‚Ä≠  How could thy heart sustain to get alone
‚Ä≠  The grey-eyed Goddess?  Her conception
‚Ä≠  Nor bringing forth had any hand of mine,
‚Ä≠  And yet, know all the Gods, I go for thine
‚Ä≠  To such kind uses.  But I‚Äôll now employ
‚Ä≠  My brain to procreate a masculine joy,
‚Ä≠  That ‚Äômongst th‚Äô Immortals may as eminent shine,
‚Ä≠  With shame affecting nor my bed nor thine.
‚Ä≠  Nor will I ever touch at thine again,
‚Ä≠  But far fly it and thee; and yet will reign
‚Ä≠  Amongst th‚Äô Immortals ever.‚Äù  This spleen spent
‚Ä≠  (Still yet left angry) far away she went
‚Ä≠  From all the Deathless, and yet pray‚Äôd to all,
‚Ä≠  Advanced her hand, and, ere she let it fall,
‚Ä≠  Used these excitements:  ‚ÄúHear me now, O Earth!
‚Ä≠  Broad Heaven above it, and beneath, your birth,
‚Ä≠  The deified Titanois, that dwell about
‚Ä≠  Vast Tartarus, from whence sprung all the rout
‚Ä≠  Of Men and Deities!  Hear me all, I say,
‚Ä≠  With all your forces, and give instant way
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô a son of mine without Jove, who yet may
‚Ä≠  Nothing inferior prove in force to him,
‚Ä≠  But past him spring as far in able limb
‚Ä≠  As he past Saturn.‚Äù  This pronounced, she strook
‚Ä≠  Life-bearing Earth so strongly, that she shook
‚Ä≠  Beneath her numb‚Äôd hand.  Which when she beheld,
‚Ä≠  Her bosom with abundant comforts swell‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  In hope all should to her desire extend.
‚Ä≠  From hence the year, that all such proofs gives end,
‚Ä≠  Grew round;  yet all that time the bed of Jove
‚Ä≠  She never touch‚Äôd at, never was her love
‚Ä≠  Enflam‚Äôd to sit near his D√¶dalian throne,
‚Ä≠  As she accustomed, to consult upon
‚Ä≠  Counsels kept dark with many a secret skill,
‚Ä≠  But kept her vow-frequented temple still,
‚Ä≠  Pleas‚Äôd with her sacrifice; till now, the nights
‚Ä≠  And days accomplish‚Äôd, and the year‚Äôs whole rights
‚Ä≠  In all her revolutions being expired,
‚Ä≠  The hours and all run out that were required
‚Ä≠  To vent a birth-right, she brought forth a son,
‚Ä≠  Like Gods or men in no condition,
‚Ä≠  But a most dreadful and pernicious thing,
‚Ä≠  Call‚Äôd Typhon, who on all the human spring
‚Ä≠  Conferr‚Äôd confusion.  Which received to hand
‚Ä≠  By Juno, instantly she gave command
‚Ä≠  (Ill to ill adding) that the Dragoness
‚Ä≠  Should bring it up; who took, and did oppress
‚Ä≠  With many a misery (to maintain th‚Äô excess
‚Ä≠  Of that inhuman monster) all the race
‚Ä≠  Of men that were of all the world the grace,
‚Ä≠  Till the far-working Ph≈ìbus at her sent
‚Ä≠  A fiery arrow, that invoked event
‚Ä≠  Of death gave to her execrable life.
‚Ä≠  Before which yet she lay in bitter strife,
‚Ä≠  With dying pains, grovelling on earth, and drew
‚Ä≠  Extreme short respirations; for which flew
‚Ä≠  A shout about the air, whence no man knew,
‚Ä≠  But came by power divine.  And then she lay
‚Ä≠  Tumbling her trunk, and winding every way
‚Ä≠  About her nasty nest, quite leaving then
‚Ä≠  Her murderous life, embrued with deaths of men.
‚Ä≠     Then Ph≈ìbus gloried, saying:  ‚ÄúThyself now lie
‚Ä≠  On men-sustaining earth, and putrefy,
‚Ä≠  Who first of putrefaction was inform‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Now on thy life have death‚Äôs cold vapours storm‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  That storm‚Äôdst on men the earth-fed so much death,
‚Ä≠  In envy of the offspring they made breathe
‚Ä≠  Their lives out on my altars.  Now from thee
‚Ä≠  Not Typhon shall enforce the misery
‚Ä≠  Of merited death, nor She, whose name implies
‚Ä≠  Such scathe (Chim√¶ra), but black earth make prise
‚Ä≠  To putrefaction thy immanities,
‚Ä≠  And bright Hyperion, that light all eyes shows,
‚Ä≠  Thine with a night of rottenness shall close.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus spake he glorying.  And then seiz‚Äôd upon
‚Ä≠  Her horrid heap, with putrefaction,
‚Ä≠  Hyperion‚Äôs lovely pow‚Äôrs; from whence her name
‚Ä≠  Took sound of Python, and heaven‚Äôs Sovereign Flame
‚Ä≠  Was surnam‚Äôd Pythius, since the sharp-eyed Sun
‚Ä≠  Affected so with putrefaction
‚Ä≠  The hellish monster.  And now Ph≈ìbus‚Äô mind
‚Ä≠  Gave him to know that falsehood had strook blind
‚Ä≠  Even his bright eye, because it could not find
‚Ä≠  The subtle Fountain‚Äôs fraud; to whom he flew,
‚Ä≠  Enflamed with anger, and in th‚Äô instant drew
‚Ä≠  Close to Delphusa, using this short vow:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúDelphusa!  You must look no longer now
‚Ä≠  To vent your frauds on me; for well I know
‚Ä≠  Your situation to be lovely, worth
‚Ä≠  A temple‚Äôs imposition, it pours forth
‚Ä≠  So delicate a stream.  But your renown
‚Ä≠  Shall now no longer shine here, but mine own.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This said, he thrust her promontory down,
‚Ä≠  And damm‚Äôd her fountain up with mighty stones,
‚Ä≠  A temple giving consecrations
‚Ä≠  In woods adjoining.  And in this fane all
‚Ä≠  On him, by surname of Delphusius, call,
‚Ä≠  Because Delphusa‚Äôs sacred flood and fame
‚Ä≠  His wrath affected so, and hid in shame.
‚Ä≠     And then thought Ph≈ìbus what descent of men
‚Ä≠  To be his ministers he should retain,
‚Ä≠  To do in stony Pythos sacrifice.
‚Ä≠  To which his mind contending, his quick eyes
‚Ä≠  He cast upon the blue sea, and beheld
‚Ä≠  A ship, on whose masts sails that wing‚Äôd it swell‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  In which were men transferr‚Äôd, many and good,
‚Ä≠  That in Minoian Cnossus ate their food,
‚Ä≠  And were Cretensians; who now are those
‚Ä≠  That all the sacrificing dues dispose,
‚Ä≠  And all the laws deliver to a word
‚Ä≠  Of Day‚Äôs great King, that wears the golden sword,
‚Ä≠  And oracles (out of his Delphian tree
‚Ä≠  That shrouds her fair arms in the cavity
‚Ä≠  Beneath Parnassus‚Äô mount) pronounce to men.
‚Ä≠  These now his priests, that lived as merchants then,
‚Ä≠  In traffics and pecuniary rates,
‚Ä≠  For sandy Pylos and the Pylian states.
‚Ä≠  Were under sail.  But now encounter‚Äôd them
‚Ä≠  Ph≈ìbus-Apollo, who into the stream
‚Ä≠  Cast himself headlong, and the strange disguise
‚Ä≠  Took of a dolphin of a goodly size.
‚Ä≠  Like which he leap‚Äôd into their ship, and lay
‚Ä≠  As an ostent of infinite dismay.
‚Ä≠  For none with any strife of mind could look
‚Ä≠  Into the omen, all the ship-masts shook,
‚Ä≠  And silent all sat with the fear they took,
‚Ä≠  Arm‚Äôd not, nor strook they sail, but as before
‚Ä≠  Went on with full trim, and a foreright blore,
‚Ä≠  Stiff, and from forth the south, the ship made fly.
‚Ä≠  When first they stripp‚Äôd the Malean promont‚Äôry,
‚Ä≠  Touch‚Äôd at Laconia‚Äôs soil, in which a town
‚Ä≠  Their ship arriv‚Äôd at, that the sea doth crown,
‚Ä≠  Called Tenarus, a place of much delight
‚Ä≠  To men that serve Heaven‚Äôs Comforter of sight.
‚Ä≠  In which are fed the famous flocks that bear
‚Ä≠  The wealthy fleeces, on a delicate lair
‚Ä≠  Being fed and seated.  Where the merchants fain
‚Ä≠  Would have put in, that they might out again
‚Ä≠  To tell the miracle that chanced to them,
‚Ä≠  And try if it would take the sacred stream,
‚Ä≠  Rushing far forth, that he again might bear
‚Ä≠  Those other fishes that abounded there
‚Ä≠  Delightsome company, or still would stay
‚Ä≠  Aboard their dry ship.  But it fail‚Äôd t‚Äô obey,
‚Ä≠  And for the rich Peloponnesian shore
‚Ä≠  Steer‚Äôd her free sail; Apollo made the blore
‚Ä≠  Directly guide it.  That obeying still
‚Ä≠  Reach‚Äôd dry Arena, and (what wish doth fill)
‚Ä≠  Fair Argyph√¶a, and the populous height
‚Ä≠  Of Thryus, whose stream, siding her, doth wait
‚Ä≠  With safe pass on Alph√¶us, Pylos‚Äô sands,
‚Ä≠  And Pylian dwellers; keeping by the strands
‚Ä≠  On which th‚Äô inhabitants of Crunius dwell,
‚Ä≠  And Helida set opposite to hell;
‚Ä≠  Chalcis and Dymes reach‚Äôd, and happily
‚Ä≠  Made sail by Pheras; all being overjoy‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With that frank gale that Jove himself employ‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  And then amongst the clouds they might descry
‚Ä≠  The hill, that far-seen Ithaca calls her Eye,
‚Ä≠  Dulichius, Samos, and, with timber graced,
‚Ä≠  Shady Zacynthus.  But when now they past
‚Ä≠  Peloponnesus all, and then when show‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The infinite vale of Crissa, that doth shroud
‚Ä≠  All rich Morea with her liberal breast,
‚Ä≠  So frank a gale there flew out of the West
‚Ä≠  As all the sky discover‚Äôd; ‚Äôtwas so great,
‚Ä≠  And blew so from the very council seat
‚Ä≠  Of Jove himself, that quickly it might send
‚Ä≠  The ship through full seas to her journey‚Äôs end.
‚Ä≠  From thence they sail‚Äôd, quite opposite, to the East,
‚Ä≠  And to the region where Light leaves his rest,
‚Ä≠  The Light himself being sacred pilot there,
‚Ä≠  And made the sea-trod ship arrive them near
‚Ä≠  The grapeful Crissa, where he rest doth take
‚Ä≠  Close to her port and sands.  And then forth brake
‚Ä≠  The far-shot King, like to a star that strows
‚Ä≠  His glorious forehead where the mid-day glows,
‚Ä≠  That all in sparkles did his state attire,
‚Ä≠  Whose lustre leap‚Äôd up to the sphere of fire.
‚Ä≠  He trod where no way oped, and pierced the place
‚Ä≠  That of his sacred tripods held the grace,
‚Ä≠  In which he lighted such a fluent flame
‚Ä≠  As gilt all Crissa; in which every dame,
‚Ä≠  And dame‚Äôs fair daughter, cast out vehement cries
‚Ä≠  At those fell fires of Ph≈ìbus‚Äô prodigies,
‚Ä≠  That shaking fears through all their fancies threw.
‚Ä≠  Then, like the mind‚Äôs swift light, again he flew
‚Ä≠  Back to the ship, shaped like a youth in height
‚Ä≠  Of all his graces, shoulders broad and straight,
‚Ä≠  And all his hair in golden curls enwrapp‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  And to the merchants thus his speech he shap‚Äôd:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúHo!  Strangers!  What are you?  And from what seat
‚Ä≠  Sail ye these ways that salt and water sweat?
‚Ä≠  To traffic justly?  Or use vagrant scapes
‚Ä≠  Void of all rule, conferring wrongs and rapes,
‚Ä≠  Like pirates, on the men ye never saw,
‚Ä≠  With minds project exempt from list or law?
‚Ä≠  Why sit ye here so stupefied, nor take
‚Ä≠  Land while ye may, nor deposition make
‚Ä≠  Of naval arms, when this the fashion is
‚Ä≠  Of men industrious, who (their faculties
‚Ä≠  Wearied at sea) leave ship, and use the land
‚Ä≠  For food, that with their healths and stomachs stand?‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, with bold minds he their breast supplied,
‚Ä≠  And thus made answer the Cretensian guide:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúStranger!  Because you seem to us no seed
‚Ä≠  Of any mortal, but celestial breed
‚Ä≠  For parts and person, joy your steps ensue,
‚Ä≠  And Gods make good the bliss we think your due.
‚Ä≠  Vouchsafe us true relation, on what land
‚Ä≠  We here arrive, and what men here command.
‚Ä≠  We were for well-known parts bound, and from Crete
‚Ä≠  (Our vaunted country) to the Pylian seat
‚Ä≠  Vow‚Äôd our whole voyage; yet arrive we here,
‚Ä≠  Quite cross to those wills that our motions steer,
‚Ä≠  Wishing to make return some other way,
‚Ä≠  Some other course desirous to assay,
‚Ä≠  To pay our lost pains.  But some God hath fill‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Our frustrate sails, defeating what we will‚Äôd.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Apollo answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúStrangers!  Though before
‚Ä≠  Ye dwelt in woody Cnossus, yet no more
‚Ä≠  Ye must be made your own reciprocals
‚Ä≠  To your loved city and fair severals
‚Ä≠  Of wives and houses, but ye shall have here
‚Ä≠  My wealthy temple, honour‚Äôd far and near
‚Ä≠  Of many a nation; for myself am son
‚Ä≠  To Jove himself, and of Apollo won
‚Ä≠  The glorious title, who thus safely through
‚Ä≠  The sea‚Äôs vast billows still have held your plough,
‚Ä≠  No ill intending, that will yet ye make
‚Ä≠  My temple here your own, and honours take
‚Ä≠  Upon yourselves, all that to me are given.
‚Ä≠  And more, the counsels of the King of Heaven
‚Ä≠  Yourselves shall know, and with his will receive
‚Ä≠  Ever the honours that all men shall give.
‚Ä≠  Do as I say then instantly, strike sail,
‚Ä≠  Take down your tackling, and your vessel hale
‚Ä≠  Up into land; your goods bring forth, and all
‚Ä≠  The instruments that into sailing fall;
‚Ä≠  Make on this shore an altar, fire enflame,
‚Ä≠  And barley white cakes offer to my name;
‚Ä≠  And then, environing the altar, pray,
‚Ä≠  And call me (as ye saw me in the day
‚Ä≠  When from the windy seas I brake swift way
‚Ä≠  Into your ship) Delphinius, since I took
‚Ä≠  A dolphin‚Äôs form then.  And to every look
‚Ä≠  That there shall seek it, that my altar shall
‚Ä≠  Be made a Delphian memorial
‚Ä≠  From thence for ever.  After this, ascend
‚Ä≠  Your swift black ship and sup, and then intend
‚Ä≠  Ingenuous offerings to the equal Gods
‚Ä≠  That in celestial seats make blest abodes.
‚Ä≠  When, having stay‚Äôd your healthful hunger‚Äôs sting,
‚Ä≠  Come all with me, and Io-p√¶ans sing
‚Ä≠  All the way‚Äôs length, till you attain the state
‚Ä≠  Where I your opulent fane have consecrate.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     To this they gave him passing diligent ear,
‚Ä≠  And vow‚Äôd to his obedience all they were.
‚Ä≠     First, striking sail, their tacklings then they losed,
‚Ä≠  And (with their gables stoop‚Äôd) their mast imposed
‚Ä≠  Into the mast-room.  Forth themselves then went,
‚Ä≠  And from the sea into the continent
‚Ä≠  Drew up their ship; which far up from the sand
‚Ä≠  They rais‚Äôd with ample rafters.  Then in hand
‚Ä≠  They took the altar; and inform‚Äôd it on
‚Ä≠  The sea‚Äôs near shore, imposing thereupon
‚Ä≠  White cakes of barley, fire made, and did stand
‚Ä≠  About it round, as Ph≈ìbus gave command,
‚Ä≠  Submitting invocations to his will.
‚Ä≠  Then sacrific‚Äôd to all the heavenly hill
‚Ä≠  Of pow‚Äôrful Godheads.  After which they eat
‚Ä≠  Aboard their ship, till with fit food replete
‚Ä≠  They rose, nor to their temple used delay.
‚Ä≠  Whom Ph≈ìbus usher‚Äôd, and touch‚Äôd all the way
‚Ä≠  His heavenly lute with art above admired,
‚Ä≠  Gracefully leading them.  When all were fired
‚Ä≠  With zeal to him, and follow‚Äôd wond‚Äôring all
‚Ä≠  To Pythos; and upon his name did call
‚Ä≠  With Io-p√¶ans, such as Cretans use.
‚Ä≠  And in their bosoms did the deified Muse
‚Ä≠  Voices of honey-harmony infuse.
‚Ä≠     With never-weary feet their way they went,
‚Ä≠  And made with all alacrity ascent
‚Ä≠  Up to Parnassus, and that long‚Äôd-for place
‚Ä≠  Where they should live, and be of men the grace.
‚Ä≠  When, all the way, Apollo show‚Äôd them still
‚Ä≠  Their far-stretch‚Äôd valleys, and their two-topp‚Äôd hill,
‚Ä≠  Their famous fane, and all that all could raise
‚Ä≠  To a supreme height of their joy and praise.
‚Ä≠     And then the Cretan captain thus inquired
‚Ä≠  Of King Apollo:  ‚ÄúSince you have retired,
‚Ä≠  O sovereign, our sad lives so far from friends
‚Ä≠  And native soil (because so far extends
‚Ä≠  Your dear mind‚Äôs pleasure) tell us how we shall
‚Ä≠  Live in your service?  To which question call
‚Ä≠  Our provident minds, because we see not crown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  This soil with store of vines, nor doth abound
‚Ä≠  In wealthy meadows, on which we may live,
‚Ä≠  As well as on men our attendance give.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He smiled, and said:  ‚ÄúO men that nothing know,
‚Ä≠  And so are follow‚Äôd with a world of woe,
‚Ä≠  That needs will succour care and curious moan,
‚Ä≠  And pour out sighs without cessation,
‚Ä≠  Were all the riches of the earth your own!
‚Ä≠  Without much business, I will render known
‚Ä≠  To your simplicities an easy way
‚Ä≠  To wealth enough, Let every man purvey
‚Ä≠  A skeane, or slaught‚Äôring steel, and his right hand,
‚Ä≠  Bravely bestowing, evermore see mann‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With killing sheep, that to my fane will flow
‚Ä≠  From all far nations.  On all which bestow
‚Ä≠  Good observation, and all else they give
‚Ä≠  To me make you your own all, and so live.
‚Ä≠  For all which watch before my temple well,
‚Ä≠  And all my counsels, above all, conceal.
‚Ä≠  If any give vain language, or to deeds,
‚Ä≠  Yea or as far as injury, proceeds,
‚Ä≠  Know that, at losers‚Äô hands, for those that gain,
‚Ä≠  It is the law of mortals to sustain.
‚Ä≠  Besides, ye shall have princes to obey,
‚Ä≠  Which still ye must, and (so ye gain) ye may.
‚Ä≠  All now is said; give all thy memory‚Äôs stay.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     And thus to thee, Jove and Latona‚Äôs son,
‚Ä≠  Be given all grace of salutation!
‚Ä≠  Both thee and others of th‚Äô Immortal State
‚Ä≠  My song shall memorize to endless date.

‚Ä≠  THE END OF THE HYMN TO APOLLO.



‚Ä≠  A HYMN TO HERMES

‚Ä≠  Hermes, the son of Jove and Maia, sing,
‚Ä≠  O Muse, th‚Äô Arcadian and Cyllenian king,
‚Ä≠  They rich in flocks, he heaven enriching still
‚Ä≠  In messages return‚Äôd with all his will.
‚Ä≠  Whom glorious Maia, the nymph rich in hair,
‚Ä≠  Mixing with Jove in amorous affair,
‚Ä≠  Brought forth to him, sustaining a retreat
‚Ä≠  From all th‚Äô Immortals of the blessed seat,
‚Ä≠  And living in the same dark cave, where Jove
‚Ä≠  Inform‚Äôd at midnight the effect of love,
‚Ä≠  Unknown to either man or Deity,
‚Ä≠  Sweet sleep once having seized the jealous eye
‚Ä≠  Of Juno deck‚Äôd with wrists of ivory.
‚Ä≠  But when great Jove‚Äôs high mind was consummate,
‚Ä≠  The tenth month had in heaven confined the date
‚Ä≠  Of Maia‚Äôs labour, and into the sight
‚Ä≠  She brought in one birth labours infinite;
‚Ä≠  For then she bore a son, that all tried ways
‚Ä≠  Could turn and wind to wish‚Äôd events assays,
‚Ä≠  A fair-tongu‚Äôd, but false-hearted, counsellor,
‚Ä≠  Rector of ox-stealers, and for all stealths bore
‚Ä≠  A varied finger; speeder of night‚Äôs spies,
‚Ä≠  And guide of all her dreams‚Äô obscurities;
‚Ä≠  Guard of door-guardians; and was born to be,
‚Ä≠  Amongst th‚Äô Immortals, that wing‚Äôd Deity
‚Ä≠  That in an instant should do acts would ask
‚Ä≠  The powers of others an eternal task.
‚Ä≠  Born in the morn, he form‚Äôd his lute at noon,
‚Ä≠  At night stole all the oxen of the Sun;
‚Ä≠  And all this in his birth‚Äôs first day was done,
‚Ä≠  Which was the fourth of the increasing moon.
‚Ä≠  Because celestial limbs sustain‚Äôd his strains,
‚Ä≠  His sacred swath-bands must not be his chains,
‚Ä≠  So, starting up, to Ph≈ìbus‚Äô herd he stept,
‚Ä≠  Found straight the high-roof‚Äôd cave where they were kept,
‚Ä≠  And th‚Äô entry passing, he th‚Äô invention found
‚Ä≠  Of making lutes; and did in wealth abound
‚Ä≠  By that invention, since he first of all
‚Ä≠  Was author of that engine musical,
‚Ä≠  By this means moved to the ingenious work:
‚Ä≠  Near the cave‚Äôs inmost overture did lurk
‚Ä≠  A tortoise, tasting th‚Äô odoriferous grass,
‚Ä≠  Leisurely moving; and this object was
‚Ä≠  The motive to Jove‚Äôs son (who could convert
‚Ä≠  To profitable uses all desert
‚Ä≠  That nature had in any work convey‚Äôd)
‚Ä≠  To form the lute; when, smiling, thus he said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúThou mov‚Äôst in me a note of excellent use,
‚Ä≠  Which thy ill form shall never so seduce
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô avert the good to be inform‚Äôd by it,
‚Ä≠  In pliant force, of my form-forging wit.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Then the slow tortoise, wrought on by his mind,
‚Ä≠  He thus saluted:  ‚ÄúAll joy to the kind
‚Ä≠  Instinct of nature in thee, born to be
‚Ä≠  The spiriter of dances, company
‚Ä≠  For feasts, and following banquets, graced and blest
‚Ä≠  For bearing light to all the interest
‚Ä≠  Claim‚Äôd in this instrument!  From whence shall spring
‚Ä≠  Play fair and sweet, to which may Graces sing.
‚Ä≠  A pretty painted coat thou putt‚Äôst on here,
‚Ä≠  O Tortoise, while thy ill-bred vital sphere
‚Ä≠  Confines thy fashion; but, surprised by me,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll bear thee home, where thou shalt ever be
‚Ä≠  A profit to me; and yet nothing more
‚Ä≠  Will I contemn thee in my merited store.
‚Ä≠  Goods with good parts got worth and honour gave,
‚Ä≠  Left goods and honours every fool may have,
‚Ä≠  And since thou first shall give me means to live,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll love thee ever.  Virtuous qualities give
‚Ä≠  To live at home with them enough content,
‚Ä≠  Where those that want such inward ornament
‚Ä≠  Fly out for outward, their life made their load.
‚Ä≠  _Tis best to be at home, harm lurks abroad._
‚Ä≠  And certainly thy virtue shall be known,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôGainst great-ill-causing incantation
‚Ä≠  To serve as for a lance or amulet.
‚Ä≠  And where, in comfort of thy vital heat,
‚Ä≠  Thou now breath‚Äôst but a sound confus‚Äôd for song,
‚Ä≠  Expos‚Äôd by nature, after death, more strong
‚Ä≠  Thou shalt in sounds of art be, and command
‚Ä≠  Song infinite sweeter.‚Äù  Thus with either hand
‚Ä≠  He took it up, and instantly took flight
‚Ä≠  Back to his cave with that his home delight.
‚Ä≠  Where (giving to the mountain tortoise vents
‚Ä≠  Of life and motion) with fit instruments
‚Ä≠  Forged of bright steel he straight inform‚Äôd a lute,
‚Ä≠  Put neck and frets to it, of which a suit
‚Ä≠  He made of splitted quills, in equal space
‚Ä≠  Impos‚Äôd upon the neck, and did embrace
‚Ä≠  Both back and bosom.  At whose height (as gins
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô extend and ease the string) he put in pins.
‚Ä≠  Seven strings of several tunes he then applied,
‚Ä≠  Made of the entrails of a sheep well-dried,
‚Ä≠  And throughly twisted.  Next he did provide
‚Ä≠  A case for all, made of an ox‚Äôs hide,
‚Ä≠  Out of his counsels to preserve as well
‚Ä≠  As to create.  And all this action fell
‚Ä≠  Into an instant consequence.  His word
‚Ä≠  And work had individual accord,
‚Ä≠  All being as swiftly to perfection brought
‚Ä≠  As any worldly man‚Äôs most ravish‚Äôd thought,
‚Ä≠  Whose mind care cuts in an infinity
‚Ä≠  Of varied parts or passions instantly,
‚Ä≠  Or as the frequent twinklings of an eye.
‚Ä≠     And thus his house-delight given absolute end,
‚Ä≠  He touch‚Äôd it, and did every string extend
‚Ä≠  (With an exploratory spirit assay‚Äôd)
‚Ä≠  To all the parts that could on it be play‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  It sounded dreadfully; to which he sung,
‚Ä≠  As if from thence the first and true force sprung
‚Ä≠  That fashions virtue.  God in him did sing.
‚Ä≠  His play was likewise an unspeakable thing,
‚Ä≠  Yet, but as an extemporal assay,
‚Ä≠  Of what show it would make being the first way,
‚Ä≠  It tried his hand; or a tumultuous noise,
‚Ä≠  Such as at feasts the first-flower‚Äôd spirits of boys
‚Ä≠  Pour out in mutual contumelies still,
‚Ä≠  As little squaring with his curious will,
‚Ä≠  Or was as wanton and untaught a store.
‚Ä≠  Of Jove, and Maia that rich shoes still wore,
‚Ä≠  He sung; who suffer‚Äôd ill reports before,
‚Ä≠  And foul stains under her fair titles bore.
‚Ä≠  But Hermes sung her nation, and her name
‚Ä≠  Did iterate ever; all her high-flown fame
‚Ä≠  Of being Jove‚Äôs mistress; celebrating all
‚Ä≠  Her train of servants, and collateral
‚Ä≠  Sumpture of houses; all her tripods there,
‚Ä≠  And caldrons huge, increasing every year.
‚Ä≠  All which she knew, yet felt her knowledge stung
‚Ä≠  With her fame‚Äôs loss, which (found) she more wish‚Äôd sung.
‚Ä≠  But now he in his sacred cradle laid
‚Ä≠  His lute so absolute, and straight convey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Himself up to a watch-tow‚Äôr forth his house,
‚Ä≠  Rich, and divinely odoriferous,
‚Ä≠  A lofty wile at work in his conceit,
‚Ä≠  Thirsting the practice of his empire‚Äôs height.
‚Ä≠  And where impostors rule (since sable night
‚Ä≠  Must serve their deeds) he did his deeds their right.
‚Ä≠  For now the never-resting Sun was turn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  For th‚Äô under earth, and in the ocean burn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His coach and coursers; when th‚Äô ingenious spy
‚Ä≠  Pieria‚Äôs shady hill had in his eye,
‚Ä≠  Where the immortal oxen of the Gods
‚Ä≠  In air‚Äôs flood solaced their select abodes,
‚Ä≠  And earth‚Äôs sweet green flow‚Äôr, that was never shorn,
‚Ä≠  Fed ever down.  And these the witty-born,
‚Ä≠  Argicides, set serious spy upon,
‚Ä≠  Severing from all the rest, and setting gone
‚Ä≠  Full fifty of the violent bellowers.
‚Ä≠  Which driving through the sands, he did reverse
‚Ä≠  (His birth‚Äôs-craft straight rememb‚Äôring) all their hoves,
‚Ä≠  And them transpos‚Äôd in opposite removes,
‚Ä≠  The fore behind set, the behind before,
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô employ the eyes of such as should explore.
‚Ä≠  And he himself, as sly-pac‚Äôd, cast away
‚Ä≠  His sandals on the sea sands; past display
‚Ä≠  And unexcogitable thoughts in act
‚Ä≠  Putting, to shun of his stol‚Äôn steps the tract,
‚Ä≠  Mixing both tamrisk and like-tamrisk sprays
‚Ä≠  In a most rare confusion, to raise
‚Ä≠  His footsteps up from earth.  Of which sprays he
‚Ä≠  (His armful gathering fresh from off the tree)
‚Ä≠  Made for his sandals ties, both leaves and ties
‚Ä≠  Holding together; and then fear‚Äôd no eyes
‚Ä≠  That could affect his feet‚Äôs discoveries.
‚Ä≠     The tamrisk boughs he gather‚Äôd, making way
‚Ä≠  Back from Pieria, but as to convey
‚Ä≠  Provision in them for his journey fit,
‚Ä≠  It being long and, therefore, needing it.
‚Ä≠     An old man, now at labour near the field
‚Ä≠  Of green Onchestus, knew the verdant yield
‚Ä≠  Of his fair armful; whom th‚Äô ingenious son
‚Ä≠  Of Maia, therefore, salutation
‚Ä≠  Did thus begin to:  ‚ÄúHo, old man!  that now
‚Ä≠  Art crooked grown with making plants to grow,
‚Ä≠  Thy nerves will far be spent, when these boughs shall
‚Ä≠  To these their leaves confer me fruit and all.
‚Ä≠  But see not thou whatever thou dost see,
‚Ä≠  Nor hear though hear, but all as touching me
‚Ä≠  Conceal, since nought it can endamage thee.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This, and no more, he said, and on drave still
‚Ä≠  His broad-brow‚Äôd oxen.  Many a shady hill,
‚Ä≠  And many an echoing valley, many a field
‚Ä≠  Pleasant and wishful, did his passage yield
‚Ä≠  Their safe transcension.  But now the divine
‚Ä≠  And black-brow‚Äôd Night, his mistress, did decline
‚Ä≠  Exceeding swiftly; Day‚Äôs most early light
‚Ä≠  Fast hasting to her first point, to excite
‚Ä≠  Worldlings to work; and in her watch-tow‚Äôr shone
‚Ä≠  King Pallas-Megamedes‚Äô seed (the Moon);
‚Ä≠  When through th‚Äô Alph√¶an flood Jove‚Äôs powerful son
‚Ä≠  Ph≈ìbus-Apollo‚Äôs ample-foreheaded herd
‚Ä≠  (Whose necks the lab‚Äôring yoke had never sphered)
‚Ä≠  Drave swiftly on; and then into a stall
‚Ä≠  (Hilly, yet pass‚Äôd to through an humble vale
‚Ä≠  And hollow dells, in a most lovely mead)
‚Ä≠  He gather‚Äôd all, and them divinely fed
‚Ä≠  With odorous cypress, and the ravishing tree
‚Ä≠  That makes his eaters lose the memory
‚Ä≠  Of name and country.  Then he brought withal
‚Ä≠  Much wood, whose sight into his search let fall
‚Ä≠  The art of making fire; which thus he tried:
‚Ä≠  He took a branch of laurel, amplified
‚Ä≠  Past others both in beauty and in size,
‚Ä≠  Yet lay next hand, rubb‚Äôd it, and straight did rise
‚Ä≠  A warm fume from it; steel being that did raise
‚Ä≠  (As agent) the attenuated bays
‚Ä≠  To that hot vapour.  So that Hermes found
‚Ä≠  Both fire first, and of it the seed close bound
‚Ä≠  In other substances; and then the seed
‚Ä≠  He multiplied, of sere-wood making feed
‚Ä≠  The apt heat of it, in a pile combined
‚Ä≠  Laid in a low pit, that in flames straight shined,
‚Ä≠  And cast a sparkling crack up to the sky,
‚Ä≠  All the dry parts so fervent were, and high
‚Ä≠  In their combustion.  And how long the force
‚Ä≠  Of glorious Vulcan kept the fire in course,
‚Ä≠  So long was he in dragging from their stall
‚Ä≠  Two of the crook-haunch‚Äôd herd, that roar‚Äôd withal,
‚Ä≠  And raged for fear, t‚Äô approach the sacred fire,
‚Ä≠  To which did all his dreadful pow‚Äôrs aspire.
‚Ä≠  When, blust‚Äôring forth their breath, he on the soil
‚Ä≠  Cast both at length, though with a world of toil,
‚Ä≠  For long he was in getting them to ground
‚Ä≠  After their through-thrust and most mortal wound.
‚Ä≠  But work to work he join‚Äôd, the flesh and cut,
‚Ä≠  Cover‚Äôd with fat, and, on treen broches put,
‚Ä≠  In pieces roasted; but in th‚Äô intestines
‚Ä≠  The black blood, and the honorary chines,
‚Ä≠  Together with the carcases, lay there,
‚Ä≠  Cast on the cold earth, as no Deities‚Äô cheer;
‚Ä≠  The hides upon a rugged rock he spread.
‚Ä≠  And thus were these now all in pieces shred,
‚Ä≠  And undistinguish‚Äôd from earth‚Äôs common herd,
‚Ä≠  Though born for long date, and to heaven endear‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And now must ever live in dead event.
‚Ä≠  But Hermes, here hence having his content,
‚Ä≠  Cared for no more, but drew to places even
‚Ä≠  The fat-works, that, of force, must have for heaven
‚Ä≠  Their capital ends, though stol‚Äôn, and therefore were
‚Ä≠  In twelve parts cut, for twelve choice Deities‚Äô cheer,
‚Ä≠  By this devotion.  To all which he gave
‚Ä≠  Their several honours, and did wish to have
‚Ä≠  His equal part thereof, as free and well
‚Ä≠  As th‚Äô other Deities; but the fatty smell
‚Ä≠  Afflicted him, though he Immortal were,
‚Ä≠  Playing mortal parts, and being like mortals here
‚Ä≠  Yet his proud mind nothing the more obey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  For being a God himself, and his own aid
‚Ä≠  Having to cause his due, and though in heart
‚Ä≠  He highly wish‚Äôd it; but the weaker part
‚Ä≠  Subdued the stronger, and went on in ill.
‚Ä≠  Even heavenly pow‚Äôr had rather have his will
‚Ä≠  Than have his right; and will‚Äôs the worst of all,
‚Ä≠  When but in least sort it is criminal,
‚Ä≠  One taint being author of a number still.
‚Ä≠  And thus, resolved to leave his hallow‚Äôd hill,
‚Ä≠  First both the fat parts and the fleshy all
‚Ä≠  Taking away, at the steep-entried stall
‚Ä≠  He laid all, all the feet and heads entire,
‚Ä≠  And all the sere-wood, making clear with fire.
‚Ä≠  And now, he leaving there then all things done,
‚Ä≠  And finish‚Äôd in their fit perfection,
‚Ä≠  The coals put out, and their black ashes thrown
‚Ä≠  From all discovery by the lovely light
‚Ä≠  The cheerful moon cast, shining all the night,
‚Ä≠  He straight assumed a novel voice‚Äôs note,
‚Ä≠  And in the whirl-pit-eating flood afloat
‚Ä≠  He set his sandals.  When now, once again
‚Ä≠  The that-morn-born Cyllenius did attain
‚Ä≠  His home‚Äôs divine height; all the far-stretch‚Äôd way
‚Ä≠  No one bless‚Äôd God encount‚Äôring his assay,
‚Ä≠  Nor mortal man; nor any dog durst spend
‚Ä≠  His born-to-bark mouth at him; till in th‚Äô end
‚Ä≠  He reach‚Äôd his cave, and at the gate went in
‚Ä≠  Crooked, and wrapt into a fold so thin
‚Ä≠  That no eye could discover his repair,
‚Ä≠  But as a darkness of th‚Äô autumnal air.
‚Ä≠  When, going on fore-right, he straight arrived
‚Ä≠  At his rich fane; his soft feet quite deprived
‚Ä≠  Of all least noise of one that trod the earth,
‚Ä≠  They trod so swift to reach his room of birth.
‚Ä≠  Where, in his swath-bands he his shoulders wrapt,
‚Ä≠  And (like an infant, newly having scap‚Äôt
‚Ä≠  The teeming straits) as in the palms he lay
‚Ä≠  Of his loved nurse.  Yet instantly would play
‚Ä≠  (Freeing his right hand) with his bearing cloth
‚Ä≠  About his knees wrapt, and straight (loosing both
‚Ä≠  His right and left hand) with his left he caught
‚Ä≠  His much-loved lute.  His mother yet was taught
‚Ä≠  His wanton wiles, nor could a God‚Äôs wit lie
‚Ä≠  Hid from a Goddess, who did therefore try
‚Ä≠  His answer thus:  ‚ÄúWhy, thou made-all-of-sleight,
‚Ä≠  And whence arriv‚Äôst thou in this rest of night?
‚Ä≠  Improvident impudent!  In my conceit
‚Ä≠  Thou rather shouldst be getting forth thy gate,
‚Ä≠  With all flight fit for thy endanger‚Äôd state,
‚Ä≠  (In merit of th‚Äô inevitable bands
‚Ä≠  To be impos‚Äôd by vex‚Äôd Latona‚Äôs hands,
‚Ä≠  Justly incens‚Äôd for her Apollo‚Äôs harms)
‚Ä≠  Than lie thus wrapt, as ready for her arms,
‚Ä≠  To take thee up and kiss thee.  Would to heaven,
‚Ä≠  In cross of that high grace, thou hadst been given
‚Ä≠  Up to perdition, ere poor mortals bear
‚Ä≠  Those black banes, that thy Father Thunderer
‚Ä≠  Hath planted thee of purpose to confer
‚Ä≠  On them and Deities!‚Äù He returned reply:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúAs master of the feats of policy,
‚Ä≠  Mother, why aim you thus amiss at me,
‚Ä≠  As if I were a son that infancy
‚Ä≠  Could keep from all the skill that age can teach,
‚Ä≠  Or had in cheating but a childish reach,
‚Ä≠  And of a mother‚Äôs mandates fear‚Äôd the breach?
‚Ä≠  I mount that art at first, that will be best
‚Ä≠  When all times consummate their cunningest,
‚Ä≠  Able to counsel now myself and thee,
‚Ä≠  In all things best, to all eternity.
‚Ä≠  We cannot live like Gods here without gifts,
‚Ä≠  No, nor without corruption and shifts,
‚Ä≠  And, much less, without eating; as we must
‚Ä≠  In keeping thy rules, and in being just,
‚Ä≠  Of which we cannot undergo the loads.
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTis better here to imitate the Gods,
‚Ä≠  And wine or wench out all time‚Äôs periods,
‚Ä≠  To that end growing rich in ready heaps,
‚Ä≠  Stored with revenues, being in corn-field reaps
‚Ä≠  Of infinite acres, than to live enclosed
‚Ä≠  In caves, to all earth‚Äôs sweetest air exposed.
‚Ä≠  I as much honour hold as Ph≈ìbus does;
‚Ä≠  And if my Father please not to dispose
‚Ä≠  Possessions to me, I myself will see
‚Ä≠  If I can force them in; for I can be
‚Ä≠  Prince of all thieves.  And, if Latona‚Äôs son
‚Ä≠  Make after my stealth indignation,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll have a scape as well as he a search,
‚Ä≠  And overtake him with a greater lurch;
‚Ä≠  For I can post to Pythos, and break through
‚Ä≠  His huge house there, where harbours wealth enough,
‚Ä≠  Most precious tripods, caldrons, steel, and gold,
‚Ä≠  Garments rich wrought, and full of liberal fold.
‚Ä≠  All which will I at pleasure own, and thou
‚Ä≠  Shalt see all, wilt thou but thy sight bestow.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus changed great words the Goat-hide-wearer‚Äôs son,
‚Ä≠  And Maia of majestic fashion.
‚Ä≠     And now the air-begot Aurora rose
‚Ä≠  From out the Ocean great-in-ebbs-and-flows,
‚Ä≠  When, at the never-shorn pure-and-fair grove
‚Ä≠  (Onchestus) consecrated to the love
‚Ä≠  Of round-and-long-neck‚Äôd Neptune, Ph≈ìbus found
‚Ä≠  A man whom heavy years had press‚Äôd half round,
‚Ä≠  And yet at work in plashing of a fence
‚Ä≠  About a vineyard, that had residence
‚Ä≠  Hard by the highway; whom Latona‚Äôs son
‚Ä≠  Made it not strange, but first did question,
‚Ä≠  And first saluted:  ‚ÄúHo you!  aged sire,
‚Ä≠  That here are hewing from the vine the briar,
‚Ä≠  For certain oxen I come here t‚Äô inquire
‚Ä≠  Out of Pieria; females all, and rear‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  All with horns wreath‚Äôd, unlike the common herd;
‚Ä≠  A coal-black bull fed by them all alone;
‚Ä≠  And all observ‚Äôd, for preservation,
‚Ä≠  Through all their foody and delicious fen
‚Ä≠  With four fierce mastiffs, like one-minded men.
‚Ä≠  These left their dogs and bull (which I admire)
‚Ä≠  And, when was near set day‚Äôs eternal fire,
‚Ä≠  From their fierce guardians, from their delicate fare,
‚Ä≠  Made clear departure.  To me then declare,
‚Ä≠  O old man, long since born, if thy grave ray
‚Ä≠  Hath any man seen making steathful way
‚Ä≠  With all those oxen.‚Äù  Th‚Äô old man made reply:
‚Ä≠  ‚Äú‚ÄôTis hard, O friend, to render readily
‚Ä≠  Account of all that may invade mine eye,
‚Ä≠  For many a traveller this highway treads,
‚Ä≠  Some in much ills search, some in noble threads,
‚Ä≠  Leading their lives out; but I this young day,
‚Ä≠  Even from her first point, have made good display
‚Ä≠  Of all men passing this abundant hill
‚Ä≠  Planted with vines, and no such stealthful ill
‚Ä≠  Her light hath shown me; but last evening, late,
‚Ä≠  I saw a thing that show‚Äôd of childish state
‚Ä≠  To my old lights, and seem‚Äôd as he pursued
‚Ä≠  A herd of oxen with brave heads endued,
‚Ä≠  Yet but an infant, and retain‚Äôd a rod;
‚Ä≠  Who wearily both this and that way trod,
‚Ä≠  His head still backwards turn‚Äôd.‚Äù  This th‚Äô old man spake;
‚Ä≠  Which he well thought upon, and swiftly brake
‚Ä≠  Into his pursuit with abundant wing,
‚Ä≠  That strook but one plain, ere he knew the thing
‚Ä≠  That was the thief to be th‚Äô impostor born;
‚Ä≠  Whom Jove yet with his son‚Äôs name did adorn.
‚Ä≠  In study and with ardour then the King
‚Ä≠  (Jove‚Äôs dazzling son) placed his exploring wing
‚Ä≠  On sacred Pylos, for his forced herd,
‚Ä≠  His ample shoulders in a cloud enspher‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of fiery crimson.  Straight the steps he found
‚Ä≠  Of his stol‚Äôn herd, and said:  ‚ÄúStrange sights confound
‚Ä≠  My apprehensive powers, for here I see
‚Ä≠  The tracks of oxen, but aversively
‚Ä≠  Converted towards the Pierian hills,
‚Ä≠  As treading to their mead of daffodils:
‚Ä≠  But nor mine eye men‚Äôs feet nor women‚Äôs draws,
‚Ä≠  Nor hoary wolves‚Äô, nor bears‚Äô, nor lions‚Äô, paws,
‚Ä≠  Nor thick-neck‚Äôd bulls, they show.  But he that does
‚Ä≠  These monstrous deeds, with never so swift shoes
‚Ä≠  Hath pass‚Äôd from that hour hither, but from hence
‚Ä≠  His foul course may meet fouler consequence.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  With this took Ph≈ìbus wing; and Hermes still,
‚Ä≠  For all his threats, secure lay in his hill
‚Ä≠  Wall‚Äôd with a wood; and more, a rock, beside,
‚Ä≠  Where a retreat ran, deeply multiplied
‚Ä≠  In blinding shadows, and where th‚Äô endless Bride
‚Ä≠  Bore to Saturnius his ingenious son;
‚Ä≠  An odour, worth a heart‚Äôs desire, being thrown
‚Ä≠  Along the heaven-sweet hill, on whose herb fed
‚Ä≠  Rich flocks of sheep, that bow not where they tread
‚Ä≠  Their horny pasterns.  There the Light of men
‚Ä≠  (Jove‚Äôs son, Apollo) straight descended then
‚Ä≠  The marble pavement, in that gloomy den.
‚Ä≠  On whom when Jove and Maia‚Äôs son set eye,
‚Ä≠  Wroth for his oxen, on then, instantly,
‚Ä≠  His odorous swath-bands flew; in which as close
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô impostor lay, as in the cool repose
‚Ä≠  Of cast-on ashes hearths of burning coals
‚Ä≠  Lie in the woods hid, under the controls
‚Ä≠  Of skilful colliers; even so close did lie
‚Ä≠  Inscrutable Hermes in Apollo‚Äôs eye,
‚Ä≠  Contracting his great Godhead to a small
‚Ä≠  And infant likeness, feet, hands, head, and all.
‚Ä≠  And as a hunter hath been often view‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  From chase retired, with both his hands embrued
‚Ä≠  In his game‚Äôs blood, that doth for water call
‚Ä≠  To cleanse his hands, and to provoke withal
‚Ä≠  Delightsome sleep, new-wash‚Äôd and laid to rest;
‚Ä≠  So now lay Hermes in the close-compress‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Chace of his oxen, his new-found-out lute
‚Ä≠  Beneath his arm held, as if no pursuit
‚Ä≠  But that prise, and the virtue of his play,
‚Ä≠  His heart affected.  But to Ph≈ìbus lay
‚Ä≠  His close heart open; and he likewise knew
‚Ä≠  The brave hill-nymph there, and her dear son, new-
‚Ä≠  Born, and as well wrapt in his wiles as weeds.
‚Ä≠  All the close shrouds too, for his rapinous deeds,
‚Ä≠  In all the cave he knew; and with his key
‚Ä≠  He open‚Äôd three of them, in which there lay
‚Ä≠  Silver and gold-heaps, nectar infinite store,
‚Ä≠  And dear ambrosia; and of weeds she wore,
‚Ä≠  Pure white and purple, a rich wardrobe shined.
‚Ä≠  Fit for the bless‚Äôd states of Pow‚Äôrs so divined.
‚Ä≠  All which discover‚Äôd, thus to Mercury
‚Ä≠  He offer‚Äôd conference:  ‚ÄúInfant!  You that lie
‚Ä≠  Wrapt so in swath-bands, instantly unfold
‚Ä≠  In what conceal‚Äôd retreats of yours you hold
‚Ä≠  My oxen stol‚Äôn by you; or straight we shall
‚Ä≠  Jar, as beseems not Pow‚Äôrs Celestial.
‚Ä≠  For I will take and hurl thee to the deeps
‚Ä≠  Of dismal Tartarus, where ill Death keeps
‚Ä≠  His gloomy and inextricable fates,
‚Ä≠  And to no eye that light illuminates
‚Ä≠  Mother nor Father shall return thee free,
‚Ä≠  But under earth shall sorrow fetter thee,
‚Ä≠  And few repute thee their superior.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     On him replied craft‚Äôs subtlest Counsellor:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúWhat cruel speech hath past Latona‚Äôs care!
‚Ä≠  Seeks he his stol‚Äòn wild-cows where Deities are?
‚Ä≠  I have nor seen nor heard, nor can report
‚Ä≠  From others‚Äô mouths one word of their resort
‚Ä≠  To any stranger.  Nor will I, to gain
‚Ä≠  A base reward, a false relation feign.
‚Ä≠  Nor would I, could I tell.  Resemble I
‚Ä≠  An ox-thief, or a man?  Especially
‚Ä≠  A man of such a courage, such a force
‚Ä≠  As to that labour goes, that violent course?
‚Ä≠  No infant‚Äôs work is that.  My pow‚Äôrs aspire
‚Ä≠  To sleep, and quenching of my hunger‚Äôs fire
‚Ä≠  With mother‚Äôs milk, and, ‚Äôgainst cold shades, to arm
‚Ä≠  With cradle-cloths my shoulders, and baths warm,
‚Ä≠  That no man may conceive the war you threat
‚Ä≠  Can spring in cause from my so peaceful heat.
‚Ä≠  And, even amongst th‚Äô Immortals it would bear
‚Ä≠  Event of absolute miracle, to hear
‚Ä≠  A new-born infant‚Äôs forces should transcend
‚Ä≠  The limits of his doors; much less contend
‚Ä≠  With untam‚Äôd oxen.  This speech nothing seems
‚Ä≠  To savour the decorum of the beams
‚Ä≠  Cast round about the air Apollo breaks,
‚Ä≠  Where his divine mind her intention speaks.
‚Ä≠  I brake but yesterday the blessed womb,
‚Ä≠  My feet are tender, and the common tomb
‚Ä≠  Of men (the Earth) lies sharp beneath their tread.
‚Ä≠  But, if you please, even by my Father‚Äôs head
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll take the great oath, that nor I protest
‚Ä≠  Myself to author on your interest
‚Ä≠  Any such usurpation, nor have I
‚Ä≠  Seen any other that feloniously
‚Ä≠  Hath forced your oxen.  Strange thing!  What are those
‚Ä≠  Oxen of yours?  Or what are oxen?  Knows
‚Ä≠  My rude mind, think you?  My ears only touch
‚Ä≠  At their renown, and hear that there are such.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This speech he pass‚Äôd; and, ever as he spake,
‚Ä≠  Beams from the hair about his eyelids brake,
‚Ä≠  His eyebrows up and down cast, and his eye
‚Ä≠  Every way look‚Äôd askance and carelessly,
‚Ä≠  And he into a lofty whistling fell,
‚Ä≠  As if he idle thought Apollo‚Äôs spell.
‚Ä≠     Apollo, gently smiling, made reply:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúO thou impostor, whose thoughts ever lie
‚Ä≠  In labour with deceit!  For certain, I
‚Ä≠  Retain opinion, that thou (even thus soon)
‚Ä≠  Hast ransack‚Äôd many a house, and not in one
‚Ä≠  Night‚Äôs-work alone, nor in one country neither,
‚Ä≠  Hast been besieging house and man together,
‚Ä≠  Rigging and rifling all ways, and no noise
‚Ä≠  Made with thy soft feet, where it all destroys.
‚Ä≠  Soft, therefore, well, and tender, thou may‚Äôst call
‚Ä≠  The feet that thy stealths go and fly withal,
‚Ä≠  For many a field-bred herdsman (unheard still)
‚Ä≠  Hast thou made drown the caverns of the hill,
‚Ä≠  Where his retreats lie, with his helpless tears,
‚Ä≠  When any flesh-stealth thy desire endears,
‚Ä≠  And thou encount‚Äôrest either flocks of sheep,
‚Ä≠  Or herds of oxen!  Up then!  Do not sleep
‚Ä≠  Thy last nap in thy cradle, but come down,
‚Ä≠  Companion of black night, and, for this crown
‚Ä≠  Of thy young rapines, bear from all the state
‚Ä≠  And style of Prince Thief, into endless date.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he took the infant in his arms,
‚Ä≠  And with him the remembrance of his harms,
‚Ä≠  This presage utt‚Äôring, lifting him aloft:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúBe evermore the miserably-soft
‚Ä≠  Slave of the belly, pursuivant of all,
‚Ä≠  And author of all mischiefs capital.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     He scorn‚Äôd his prophecy so he sneezed in‚Äôs face
‚Ä≠  Most forcibly; which hearing, his embrace
‚Ä≠  He loathed and hurl‚Äôd him ‚Äôgainst the ground; yet still
‚Ä≠  Took seat before him, though, with all the ill
‚Ä≠  He bore by him, he would have left full fain
‚Ä≠  That hewer of his heart so into twain.
‚Ä≠  Yet salv‚Äôd all thus:  ‚ÄúCome, you so-swaddled thing!
‚Ä≠  Issue of Maia, and the Thunder‚Äôs King!
‚Ä≠  Be confident, I shall hereafter find
‚Ä≠  My broad-brow‚Äôd oxen, my prophetic mind
‚Ä≠  So far from blaming this thy course, that I
‚Ä≠  Foresee thee in it to posterity
‚Ä≠  The guide of all men, always, to their ends.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This spoken, Hermes from the earth ascends,
‚Ä≠  Starting aloft, and as in study went,
‚Ä≠  Wrapping himself in his integument,
‚Ä≠  And thus ask‚Äôd Ph≈ìbus:  ‚ÄúWhither force you me,
‚Ä≠  Far-shot, and far most powerful Deity?
‚Ä≠  I know, for all your feigning, you‚Äôre still wroth
‚Ä≠  About your oxen, and suspect my troth.
‚Ä≠  O Jupiter!  I wish the general race
‚Ä≠  Of all earth‚Äôs oxen rooted from her face.
‚Ä≠  I steal your oxen!  I again profess
‚Ä≠  That neither I have stol‚Äôn them, nor can guess
‚Ä≠  Who else should steal them.  What strange beasts are these
‚Ä≠  Your so-loved oxen?  I must say, to please
‚Ä≠  Your humour thus far, that even my few hours
‚Ä≠  Have heard their fame.  But be the sentence yours
‚Ä≠  Of the debate betwixt us, or to Jove
‚Ä≠  (For more indifferency) the cause remove.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus when the solitude-affecting God,
‚Ä≠  And the Latonian seed, had laid abroad
‚Ä≠  All things betwixt them; though not yet agreed,
‚Ä≠  Yet, might I speak, Apollo did proceed
‚Ä≠  Nothing unjustly, to charge Mercury
‚Ä≠  With stealing of the cows he does deny.
‚Ä≠  But his profession was, with filed speech,
‚Ä≠  And craft‚Äôs fair compliments, to overreach
‚Ä≠  All, and even Ph≈ìbus.  Who because he knew
‚Ä≠  His trade of subtlety, he still at view
‚Ä≠  Hunted his foe through all the sandy way
‚Ä≠  Up to Olympus.  Nor would let him stray
‚Ä≠  From out his sight, but kept behind him still.
‚Ä≠     And now they reach‚Äôd the odorif‚Äôrous hill
‚Ä≠  Of high Olympus, to their Father Jove,
‚Ä≠  To arbitrate the cause in which they strove.
‚Ä≠  Where, before both, talents of justice were
‚Ä≠  Propos‚Äôd for him whom Jove should sentence clear,
‚Ä≠  In cause of their contention.  And now
‚Ä≠  About Olympus, ever crown‚Äôd with snow,
‚Ä≠  The rumour of their controversy flew.
‚Ä≠  All the Incorruptible, to their view,
‚Ä≠  On Heaven‚Äôs steep mountain made return‚Äôd repair.
‚Ä≠  Hermes, and He that light hurls through the air,
‚Ä≠  Before the Thund‚Äôrer‚Äôs knees stood; who begun
‚Ä≠  To question thus far his illustrious Son:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúPh≈ìbus!  To what end bring‚Äôst thou captive here
‚Ä≠  Him in whom my mind puts delights so dear?
‚Ä≠  This new-born infant, that the place supplies
‚Ä≠  Of Herald yet to all the Deities?
‚Ä≠  This serious business, you may witness, draws
‚Ä≠  The Deities‚Äô whole Court to discuss the cause.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Ph≈ìbus replied:  ‚ÄúAnd not unworthy is
‚Ä≠  The cause of all the Court of Deities,
‚Ä≠  For, you shall hear, it comprehends the weight
‚Ä≠  Of devastation, and the very height
‚Ä≠  Of spoil and rapine, even of Deities‚Äô rights.
‚Ä≠  Yet you, as if myself loved such delights,
‚Ä≠  Use words that wound my heart.  I bring you here
‚Ä≠  An infant, that, even now, admits no peer
‚Ä≠  In rapes and robb‚Äôries.  Finding out his place,
‚Ä≠  After my measure of an infinite space,
‚Ä≠  In the Cyllenian mountain, such a one
‚Ä≠  In all the art of opprobration,
‚Ä≠  As not in all the Deities I have seen,
‚Ä≠  Nor in th‚Äô oblivion-mark‚Äôd whole race of men.
‚Ä≠  In night he drave my oxen from their leas,
‚Ä≠  Along the lofty roar-resounding seas,
‚Ä≠  From out the road-way quite; the steps of them
‚Ä≠  So quite transpos‚Äôd, as would amaze the beam
‚Ä≠  Of any mind‚Äôs eye, being so infinite much
‚Ä≠  Involv‚Äôd in doubt, as show‚Äôd a deified touch
‚Ä≠  Went to the work‚Äôs performance; all the way,
‚Ä≠  Through which my cross-hoved cows he did convey,
‚Ä≠  Had dust so darkly-hard to search, and he
‚Ä≠  So past all measure wrapt in subtilty.
‚Ä≠  For, nor with feet, nor hands, he form‚Äôd his steps,
‚Ä≠  In passing through the dry way‚Äôs sandy heaps,
‚Ä≠  But used another counsel to keep hid
‚Ä≠  His monstrous tracts, that show‚Äôd as one had slid
‚Ä≠  On oak or other boughs, that swept out still
‚Ä≠  The footsteps of his oxen, and did fill
‚Ä≠  Their prints up ever, to the daffodill
‚Ä≠  (Or dainty-feeding meadow) as they trod,
‚Ä≠  Driven by this cautelous and infant God.
‚Ä≠     A mortal man, yet, saw him driving on
‚Ä≠  His prey to Pylos.  Which when he had done,
‚Ä≠  And got his pass sign‚Äôd, with a sacred fire,
‚Ä≠  In peace, and freely (though to his desire,
‚Ä≠  Not to the Gods, he offer‚Äôd part of these
‚Ä≠  My ravish‚Äôd oxen) he retires, and lies,
‚Ä≠  Like to the gloomy night, in his dim den,
‚Ä≠  All hid in darkness; and in clouts again
‚Ä≠  Wrapp‚Äôd him so closely, that the sharp-seen eye
‚Ä≠  Of your own eagle could not see him lie.
‚Ä≠  For with his hands the air he rarified
‚Ä≠  (This way, and that moved) till bright gleams did glide
‚Ä≠  About his being, that, if any eye
‚Ä≠  Should dare the darkness, light appos‚Äôd so nigh
‚Ä≠  Might blind it quite with her antipathy.
‚Ä≠  Which wile he wove, in curious care t‚Äô illude
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô extreme of any eye that could intrude.
‚Ä≠  On which relying, he outrageously
‚Ä≠  (When I accus‚Äôd him) trebled his reply:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄòI did not see, I did not hear, nor I
‚Ä≠  Will tell at all, that any other stole
‚Ä≠  Your broad-brow‚Äôd beeves.  Which an impostor‚Äôs soul
‚Ä≠  Would soon have done, and any author fain
‚Ä≠  Of purpose only a reward to gain.‚Äô
‚Ä≠  And thus he colour‚Äôd truth in every lie.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, Apollo sat; and Mercury
‚Ä≠  The Gods‚Äô Commander pleased with this reply:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúFather!  I‚Äôll tell thee truth (for I am true,
‚Ä≠  And far from art to lie): He did pursue
‚Ä≠  Even to my cave his oxen this self day,
‚Ä≠  The sun new-raising his illustrious ray;
‚Ä≠  But brought with him none of the Bliss-endued,
‚Ä≠  Nor any ocular witness, to conclude
‚Ä≠  His bare assertion; but his own command
‚Ä≠  Laid on with strong and necessary hand,
‚Ä≠  To show his oxen; using threats to cast
‚Ä≠  My poor and infant powers into the vast
‚Ä≠  Of ghastly Tartarus; because he bears
‚Ä≠  Of strength-sustaining youth the flaming years,
‚Ä≠  And I but yesterday produced to light.
‚Ä≠  By which it fell into his own free sight,
‚Ä≠  That I in no similitude appear‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of power to be the forcer of a herd.
‚Ä≠  And credit me, O Father, since the grace
‚Ä≠  Of that name, in your style, you please to place,
‚Ä≠  I drave not home his oxen, no, nor prest
‚Ä≠  Past mine own threshold; for ‚Äôtis manifest,
‚Ä≠  I reverence with my soul the Sun, and all
‚Ä≠  The knowing dwellers in this heavenly Hall,
‚Ä≠  Love you, observe the least; and ‚Äôtis most clear
‚Ä≠  In your own knowledge, that my merits bear
‚Ä≠  No least guilt of his blame.  To all which I
‚Ä≠  Dare add heaven‚Äôs great oath, boldly swearing by
‚Ä≠  All these so well-built entries of the Blest.
‚Ä≠  And therefore when I saw myself so prest
‚Ä≠  With his reproaches, I confess I burn‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  In my pure gall, and harsh reply return‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Add your aid to your younger then, and free
‚Ä≠  The scruple fixt in Ph≈ìbus‚Äô jealousy.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said he wink‚Äôd upon his Sire; and still
‚Ä≠  His swathbands held beneath his arm; no will
‚Ä≠  Discern‚Äôd in him to hide, but have them shown.
‚Ä≠     Jove laugh‚Äôd aloud at his ingenious Son,
‚Ä≠  Quitting himself with art, so likely wrought,
‚Ä≠  As show‚Äôd in his heart not a rapinous thought;
‚Ä≠  Commanding both to bear atoned minds
‚Ä≠  And seek out th‚Äô oxen; in which search he binds
‚Ä≠  Hermes to play the guide, and show the Sun
‚Ä≠  (All grudge exil‚Äôd) the shrowd to which he won
‚Ä≠  His fair-eyed oxen; then his forehead bow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  For sign it must be so; and Hermes show‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  His free obedience; so soon he inclined
‚Ä≠  To his persuasion and command his mind.
‚Ä≠     Now, then, Jove‚Äôs jarring Sons no longer stood,
‚Ä≠  But sandy Pylos and th‚Äô Alph√¶an flood
‚Ä≠  Reach‚Äôd instantly, and made as quick a fall
‚Ä≠  On those rich-feeding fields and lofty stall
‚Ä≠  Where Ph≈ìbus‚Äô oxen Hermes safely kept,
‚Ä≠  Driven in by night.  When suddenly he stept
‚Ä≠  Up to the stony cave, and into light
‚Ä≠  Drave forth the oxen.  Ph≈ìbus at first sight
‚Ä≠  Knew them the same, and saw apart dispread
‚Ä≠  Upon a high-rais‚Äôd rock the hides new flead
‚Ä≠  Of th‚Äô oxen sacrific‚Äôd.  Then Ph≈ìbus said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúO thou in crafty counsels undisplaid!
‚Ä≠  How couldst thou cut the throats, and cast to earth,
‚Ä≠  Two such huge oxen, being so young a birth,
‚Ä≠  And a mere infant?  I admire thy force,
‚Ä≠  And will, behind thy back.  But this swift course
‚Ä≠  Of growing into strength thou hadst not need
‚Ä≠  Continue any long date, O thou Seed
‚Ä≠  Of honour‚Äôd Maia!‚Äù  Hermes (to show how
‚Ä≠  He did those deeds) did forthwith cut and bow
‚Ä≠  Strong osiers in soft folds, and strappled straight
‚Ä≠  One of his hugest oxen, all his weight
‚Ä≠  Lay‚Äông prostrate on the earth at Ph≈ìbus‚Äô feet,
‚Ä≠  All his four cloven hoves eas‚Äôly made to greet
‚Ä≠  Each other upwards, all together brought.
‚Ä≠  In all which bands yet all the beast‚Äôs powers wrought,
‚Ä≠  To rise, and stand; when all the herd about
‚Ä≠  The mighty Hermes rush‚Äôd in, to help out
‚Ä≠  Their fellow from his fetters.  Ph≈ìbus‚Äô view
‚Ä≠  Of all this up to admiration drew
‚Ä≠  Even his high forces; and stern looks he threw
‚Ä≠  At Hermes for his herd‚Äôs wrong, and the place
‚Ä≠  To which he had retir‚Äôd them, being in grace
‚Ä≠  And fruitful riches of it so entire;
‚Ä≠  All which set all his force on envious fire.
‚Ä≠  All whose heat flew out of his eyes in flames,
‚Ä≠  Which fain he would have hid, to hide the shames,
‚Ä≠  Of his ill-govern‚Äôd passions.  But with ease
‚Ä≠  Hermes could calm them, and his humours please.
‚Ä≠  Still at his pleasure, were he ne‚Äôer so great
‚Ä≠  In force and fortitude, and high in heat,
‚Ä≠  In all which he his lute took, and assay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  A song upon him, and so strangely play‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  That from his hand a ravishing horror flew.
‚Ä≠  Which Ph≈ìbus into laughter turn‚Äôd, and grew
‚Ä≠  Pleasant past measure; tunes so artful clear
‚Ä≠  Strook even his heart-strings, and his mind made hear.
‚Ä≠  His lute so powerful was in forcing love,
‚Ä≠  As his hand rul‚Äôd it, that from him it drove
‚Ä≠  All fear of Ph≈ìbus; yet he gave him still
‚Ä≠  The upper hand; and, to advance his skill
‚Ä≠  To utmost miracle, he play‚Äôd sometimes
‚Ä≠  Single awhile; in which, when all the climes
‚Ä≠  Of rapture he had reach‚Äôd, to make the Sun
‚Ä≠  Admire enough, O then his voice would run
‚Ä≠  Such points upon his play, and did so move,
‚Ä≠  They took Apollo prisoner to his love.
‚Ä≠  And now the deathless Gods and deathful Earth
‚Ä≠  He sung, beginning at their either‚Äôs birth
‚Ä≠  To full extent of all their empery.
‚Ä≠  And, first, the honour to Mnemosyne,
‚Ä≠  The Muses‚Äô mother, of all Goddess states
‚Ä≠  He gave; even forced to‚Äôt by the equal fates.
‚Ä≠  And then (as it did in priority fall
‚Ä≠  Of age and birth) he celebrated all.
‚Ä≠  And with such elegance and order sung
‚Ä≠  (His lute still touch‚Äôd, to stick more off his tongue)
‚Ä≠  That Ph≈ìbus‚Äô heart with infinite love he eat.
‚Ä≠  Who, therefore, thus did his deserts entreat:
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúMaster of sacrifice!  Chief soul of feast!
‚Ä≠  Patient of all pains!  Artizan so blest,
‚Ä≠  That all things thou canst do in anyone!
‚Ä≠  Worth fifty oxen is th‚Äô invention
‚Ä≠  Of this one lute.  We both shall now, I hope,
‚Ä≠  In firm peace work to all our wishes‚Äô scope.
‚Ä≠  Inform me (thou that every way canst wind,
‚Ä≠  And turn to act, all wishes of thy mind)
‚Ä≠  Together with thy birth came all thy skill?
‚Ä≠  Or did some God, or God-like man, instill
‚Ä≠  This heavenly song to thee?  Methink I hear
‚Ä≠  A new voice, such as never yet came near
‚Ä≠  The breast of any, either man or God,
‚Ä≠  Till in thee it had prime and period.
‚Ä≠  What art, what Muse that med‚Äôcine can produce
‚Ä≠  For cares most cureless, what inveterate use
‚Ä≠  Or practice of a virtue so profuse
‚Ä≠  (Which three do all the contribution keep
‚Ä≠  That Joy or Love confers, or pleasing Sleep.)
‚Ä≠  Taught thee the sovereign facture of them all?
‚Ä≠  I of the Muses am the capital
‚Ä≠  Consort, or follower; and to these belong
‚Ä≠  The grace of dance, all worthy ways of song,
‚Ä≠  And ever-flourishing verse, the delicate set
‚Ä≠  And sound of instruments.  But never yet
‚Ä≠  Did anything so much affect my mind
‚Ä≠  With joy and care to compass, as this kind
‚Ä≠  Of song and play, that for the spritely feast
‚Ä≠  Of flourishing assemblies are the best
‚Ä≠  And aptest works that ever worth gave act.
‚Ä≠  My powers with admiration stand distract,
‚Ä≠  To hear with what a hand to make in love
‚Ä≠  Thou rul‚Äôst thy lute.  And (though thy yong‚Äôst hours move
‚Ä≠  At full art in old councils) here I vow
‚Ä≠  (Even by this cornel dart I use to throw)
‚Ä≠  To thee, and to thy mother, I‚Äôll make thee
‚Ä≠  Amongst the Gods of glorious degree,
‚Ä≠  Guide of men‚Äôs ways and theirs; and will impart
‚Ä≠  To thee the mighty imperatory art,
‚Ä≠  Bestow rich gifts on thee, and in the end
‚Ä≠  Never deceive thee.‚Äù  Hermes (as a friend
‚Ä≠  That wrought on all advantage, and made gain
‚Ä≠  His capital object) thus did entertain
‚Ä≠  Ph≈ìbus Apollo:  ‚ÄúDo thy dignities,
‚Ä≠  Far-working God and circularly wise,
‚Ä≠  Demand my virtues?  Without envy I
‚Ä≠  Will teach thee to ascend my faculty.
‚Ä≠  And this day thou shalt reach it; finding me,
‚Ä≠  In acts and counsels, all ways kind to thee,
‚Ä≠  As one that all things knows, and first tak‚Äôst seat
‚Ä≠  Amongst th‚Äô Immortals, being good and great,
‚Ä≠  And therefore to Jove‚Äôs love mak‚Äôst free access,
‚Ä≠  Even out of his accomplisht holiness.
‚Ä≠  Great gifts he likewise gives thee; who, fame says,
‚Ä≠  Hast won thy greatness by his will, his ways,
‚Ä≠  By him know‚Äôst all the powers prophetical,
‚Ä≠  O thou far-worker, and the fates of all!
‚Ä≠  Yea, and I know thee rich, yet apt to learn,
‚Ä≠  And even thy wish dost but discern and earn.
‚Ä≠  And since thy soul so burns to know the way
‚Ä≠  So play and sing as I do, sing, and play;
‚Ä≠  Play, and perfection in thy play employ;
‚Ä≠  And be thy care, to learn things good, thy joy.
‚Ä≠  Take thou my lute (my love) and give thou me
‚Ä≠  The glory of so great a faculty.
‚Ä≠  This sweet-tuned consort, held but in thy hand,
‚Ä≠  Sing, and perfection in thy song command.
‚Ä≠  For thou already hast the way to speak
‚Ä≠  Fairly and elegantly, and to break
‚Ä≠  All eloquence into thy utter‚Äôd mind.
‚Ä≠  One gift from heaven found may another find.
‚Ä≠  Use then securely this thy gift, and go
‚Ä≠  To feasts and dances that enamour so,
‚Ä≠  And to that covetous sport of getting glory,
‚Ä≠  That day nor night will suffer to be sory.
‚Ä≠  Whoever does but say in verse, sings still;
‚Ä≠  Which he that can of any other skill
‚Ä≠  Is capable, so he be taught by art
‚Ä≠  And wisdom, and can speak at every part
‚Ä≠  Things pleasing to an understanding mind;
‚Ä≠  And such a one that seeks this lute shall find.
‚Ä≠  Him still it teaches eas‚Äôly, though he plays
‚Ä≠  Soft voluntaries only, and assays
‚Ä≠  As wanton as the sports of children are,
‚Ä≠  And (even when he aspires to singular
‚Ä≠  In all the mast‚Äôries he shall play or sing)
‚Ä≠  Finds the whole work but an unhappy thing,
‚Ä≠  He, I say, sure shall of this lute be king.
‚Ä≠  But he, whoever rudely sets upon
‚Ä≠  Of this lute‚Äôs skill th‚Äô inquest or question
‚Ä≠  Never so ardently and angrily,
‚Ä≠  Without the aptness and ability
‚Ä≠  Of art, and nature fitting, never shall
‚Ä≠  Aspire to this, but utter trivial
‚Ä≠  And idle accents, though sung ne‚Äôer so loud,
‚Ä≠  And never so commended of the crowd.
‚Ä≠  But thee I know, O eminent Son of Jove,
‚Ä≠  The fiery learner of whatever Love
‚Ä≠  Hath sharpen‚Äôd thy affections to achieve,
‚Ä≠  And thee I give this lute.  Let us now live
‚Ä≠  Feeding upon the hill and horse-fed earth
‚Ä≠  Our never-handled oxen; whose dear birth
‚Ä≠  Their females, fellow‚Äôd with their males, let flow
‚Ä≠  In store enough hereafter; nor must you
‚Ä≠  (However cunning-hearted your wits are)
‚Ä≠  Boil in your gall a grudge too circular.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus gave he him his lute, which he embrac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And gave again a goad, whose bright head cast
‚Ä≠  Beams like the light forth; leaving to his care
‚Ä≠  His oxen‚Äôs keeping.  Which, with joyful fare,
‚Ä≠  He took on him.  The lute Apollo took
‚Ä≠  Into his left hand, and aloft he shook
‚Ä≠  Delightsome sounds up, to which God did sing.
‚Ä≠     Then were the oxen to their endless spring
‚Ä≠  Turn‚Äôd; and Jove‚Äôs two illustrous Offsprings flew
‚Ä≠  Up to Olympus where it ever snew,
‚Ä≠  Delighted with their lute‚Äôs sound all the way.
‚Ä≠  Whom Jove much joy‚Äôd to see, and endless stay
‚Ä≠  Gave to their knot of friendship.  From which date
‚Ä≠  Hermes gave Ph≈ìbus an eternal state
‚Ä≠  In his affection, whose sure pledge and sign
‚Ä≠  His lute was, and the doctrine so divine
‚Ä≠  Jointly conferr‚Äôd on him; which well might be
‚Ä≠  True symbol of his love‚Äôs simplicity.
‚Ä≠  On th‚Äô other part, Apollo in his friend
‚Ä≠  Form‚Äôd th‚Äô art of wisdom, to the binding end
‚Ä≠  Of his vow‚Äôd friendship; and (for further meed)
‚Ä≠  Gave him the far-heard fistulary reed.
‚Ä≠     For all these forms of friendship, Ph≈ìbus yet
‚Ä≠  Fear‚Äôd that both form and substance were not met
‚Ä≠  In Mercury‚Äôs intentions; and, in plain,
‚Ä≠  Said (since he saw him born to craft and gain,
‚Ä≠  And that Jove‚Äôs will had him the honour done
‚Ä≠  To change at his will the possession
‚Ä≠  Of others‚Äô goods) he fear‚Äôd his breach of vows
‚Ä≠  In stealing both his lute and cunning bows,
‚Ä≠  And therefore wish‚Äôd that what the Gods affect
‚Ä≠  Himself would witness, and to his request
‚Ä≠  His head bow, swearing by th‚Äô impetuous flood
‚Ä≠  Of Styx that of his whole possessions not a good
‚Ä≠  He would diminish, but therein maintain
‚Ä≠  The full content in which his mind did reign.
‚Ä≠  And then did Maia‚Äôs son his forehead bow,
‚Ä≠  Making, by all that he desired, his vow
‚Ä≠  Never to prey more upon anything
‚Ä≠  In just possession of the far-shot King,
‚Ä≠  Nor ever to come near a house of his.
‚Ä≠     Latonian Ph≈ìbus bow‚Äôd his brow to this,
‚Ä≠  With his like promise, saying:  ‚ÄúNot anyone
‚Ä≠  Of all the Gods, nor any man, that son
‚Ä≠  Is to Saturnius, is more dear to me,
‚Ä≠  More trusted, nor more honour‚Äôd is than thee.
‚Ä≠  Which yet with greater gifts of Deity
‚Ä≠  In future I‚Äôll confirm, and give thy state
‚Ä≠  A rod that riches shall accumulate,
‚Ä≠  Nor leave the bearer thrall to death, or fate,
‚Ä≠  Or any sickness.  All of gold it is,
‚Ä≠  Three-leaved, and full of all felicities.
‚Ä≠  And, this shall be thy guardian, this shall give
‚Ä≠  The Gods to thee in all the truth they live,
‚Ä≠  And, finally, shall this the tut‚Äôress be
‚Ä≠  Of all the words and works informing me
‚Ä≠  From Jove‚Äôs high counsels, making known to thee
‚Ä≠  All my instructions.  But to prophesy,
‚Ä≠  Of best of Jove‚Äôs beloved, and that high skill
‚Ä≠  Which to obtain lies burning in thy will,
‚Ä≠  Nor thee, nor any God, will Fate let learn.
‚Ä≠  Only Jove‚Äôs mind hath insight to discern
‚Ä≠  What that importeth; yet am I allow‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  (My known faith trusted, and my forehead bow‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Our great oath taken, to resolve to none
‚Ä≠  Of all th‚Äô Immortals the restriction
‚Ä≠  Of that deep knowledge) of it all the mind.
‚Ä≠  Since then it sits in such fast bounds confin‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  O brother, when the golden rod is held
‚Ä≠  In thy strong hand, seek not to have reveal‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Any sure fate that Jove will have conceal‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  For no man shall, by know‚Äông, prevent his fate;
‚Ä≠  And therefore will I hold in my free state
‚Ä≠  The pow‚Äôr to hurt and help what man I will,
‚Ä≠  Of all the greatest, or least touch‚Äôd with ill,
‚Ä≠  That walk within the circle of mine eye,
‚Ä≠  In all the tribes and sexes it shall try.
‚Ä≠  Yet, truly, any man shall have his will
‚Ä≠  To reap the fruits of my prophetic skill,
‚Ä≠  Whoever seeks it by the voice or wing
‚Ä≠  Of birds, born truly such events to sing.
‚Ä≠  Nor will I falsely, nor with fallacies,
‚Ä≠  Infringe the truth on which his faith relies,
‚Ä≠  But he that truths in chattering plumes would find,
‚Ä≠  Quite opposite to them that prompt my mind,
‚Ä≠  And learn by natural forgers of vain lies
‚Ä≠  The more-than-ever-certain Deities,
‚Ä≠  That man shall sea-ways tread that leave no tracts,
‚Ä≠  And false or no guide find for all his facts.
‚Ä≠  And yet will I his gifts accept as well
‚Ä≠  As his to whom the simple truth I tell.
‚Ä≠     One other thing to thee I‚Äôll yet make known,
‚Ä≠  Maia‚Äôs exceedingly renowned son,
‚Ä≠  And Jove‚Äôs, and of the Gods‚Äô whole session
‚Ä≠  The most ingenious genius:  There dwell
‚Ä≠  Within a crooked cranny, in a dell
‚Ä≠  Beneath Parnassus, certain Sisters born,
‚Ä≠  Call‚Äôd Parc√¶, whom extreme swift wings adorn,
‚Ä≠  Their number three, that have upon their heads
‚Ä≠  White barley-flour still sprinkled, and are maids;
‚Ä≠  And these are schoolmistresses of things to come,
‚Ä≠  Without the gift of prophecy.  Of whom
‚Ä≠  (Being but a boy, and keeping oxen near)
‚Ä≠  I learn‚Äôd their skill, though my great Father were
‚Ä≠  Careless of it, or them.  These flying from home
‚Ä≠  To others‚Äô roofs, and fed with honeycomb,
‚Ä≠  Command all skill, and (being enraged then)
‚Ä≠  Will freely tell the truths of things to men.
‚Ä≠  But if they give them not that Gods‚Äô sweet meat,
‚Ä≠  They then are apt to utter their deceit,
‚Ä≠  And lead men from their way.  And these will I
‚Ä≠  Give thee hereafter, when their scrutiny
‚Ä≠  And truth thou hast both made and learn‚Äôd; and then
‚Ä≠  Please thyself with them, and the race of men
‚Ä≠  (Wilt thou know any) with thy skill endear,
‚Ä≠  Who will, be sure, afford it greedy ear,
‚Ä≠  And hear it often if it prove sincere.
‚Ä≠     Take these, O Maia‚Äôs son, and in thy care
‚Ä≠  Be horse and oxen, all such men as are
‚Ä≠  Patient of labour, lions, white-tooth‚Äôd boars,
‚Ä≠  Mastiffs, and flocks that feed the flow‚Äôry shores,
‚Ä≠  And every four-foot beast; all which shall stand
‚Ä≠  In awe of thy high imperatory hand.
‚Ä≠  Be thou to Dis, too, sole Ambassador,
‚Ä≠  Who, though all gifts and bounties he abhor,
‚Ä≠  On thee he will bestow a wealthy one.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     Thus king Apollo honour‚Äôd Maia‚Äôs son
‚Ä≠  With all the rites of friendship; all whose love
‚Ä≠  Had imposition from the will of Jove.
‚Ä≠     And thus with Gods and mortals Hermes lived,
‚Ä≠  Who truly help‚Äôd but few, but all deceived
‚Ä≠  With an undifferencing respect, and made
‚Ä≠  Vain words and false persuasions his trade.
‚Ä≠  His deeds were all associates of the night,
‚Ä≠  In which his close wrongs cared for no man‚Äôs right.
‚Ä≠     So all salutes to Hermes that are due,
‚Ä≠  Of whom, and all Gods, shall my Muse sing true.

‚Ä≠  THE END OF THE HYMN TO HERMES.



‚Ä≠  A HYMN TO VENUS

‚Ä≠  The force, O Muse, and functions now unfold
‚Ä≠  Of Cyprian Venus, grac‚Äôd with mines of gold;
‚Ä≠  Who even in Deities lights love‚Äôs sweet desire,
‚Ä≠  And all Death‚Äôs kinds of men makes kiss her fire,
‚Ä≠  All air‚Äôs wing‚Äôd nation, all the belluine,
‚Ä≠  That or the earth feeds, or the seas confine.
‚Ä≠  To all which appertain the love and care
‚Ä≠  Of well-crown‚Äôd Venus‚Äô works.  Yet three there are
‚Ä≠  Whose minds She neither can deceive nor move;
‚Ä≠  Pallas, the Seed of √Ügis-bearing Jove,
‚Ä≠  Who still lives indevirginate, her eyes
‚Ä≠  Being blue, and sparkling like the freezing skies,
‚Ä≠  Whom all the gold of Venus never can
‚Ä≠  Tempt to affect her facts with God or man.
‚Ä≠  She, loving strife, and Mars‚Äôs working banes,
‚Ä≠  Pitch‚Äôd fields and fights, and famous artizans,
‚Ä≠  Taught earthy men first all the arts that are,
‚Ä≠  Chariots, and all the frames vehicular,
‚Ä≠  Chiefly with brass arm‚Äôd, and adorn‚Äôd for war.
‚Ä≠  Where Venus only soft-skinn‚Äôd wenches fills
‚Ä≠  With wanton house-works, and suggests those skills
‚Ä≠  Still to their studies.  Whom Diana neither,
‚Ä≠  That bears the golden distaff, and together
‚Ä≠  Calls horns, and hollows, and the cries of hounds,
‚Ä≠  And owns the epithet of loving sounds
‚Ä≠  For their sakes, springing from such spritely sports,
‚Ä≠  Can catch with her kind lures; but hill resorts
‚Ä≠  To wild-beasts, slaughters, accents far-off heard
‚Ä≠  Of harps and dances, and of woods unshear‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The sacred shades she loves, yet likes as well
‚Ä≠  Cities where good men and their offspring dwell.
‚Ä≠  The third, whom her kind passions nothing please,
‚Ä≠  Is virgin Vesta; whom Saturnides
‚Ä≠  Made reverend with his counsels, when his Sire,
‚Ä≠  That adverse counsels agitates, life‚Äôs fire
‚Ä≠  Had kindled in her, being his last-begot.
‚Ä≠  Whom Neptune woo‚Äôd to knit with him the knot
‚Ä≠  Of honour‚Äôd nuptials, and Apollo too;
‚Ä≠  Which with much vehemence she refused to do,
‚Ä≠  And stern repulses put upon them both,
‚Ä≠  Adding to all her vows the Gods‚Äô great oath,
‚Ä≠  And touching Jove‚Äôs chin, which must consummate
‚Ä≠  All vows so bound, that she would hold her state,
‚Ä≠  And be th‚Äô invincible Maid of Deities
‚Ä≠  Through all her days‚Äô dates.  For Saturnides
‚Ä≠  Gave her a fair gift in her nuptials‚Äô stead,
‚Ä≠  To sit in midst of his house, and be fed
‚Ä≠  With all the free and richest feast of heaven,
‚Ä≠  In all the temples of the Gods being given
‚Ä≠  The prize of honour.  Not a mortal man,
‚Ä≠  (That either, of the Pow‚Äôrs Olympian
‚Ä≠  His half-birth having, may be said to be
‚Ä≠  A mortal of the Gods, or else that he,
‚Ä≠  Deities‚Äô wills doing, is of Deity)
‚Ä≠  But gives her honour of the amplest kind.
‚Ä≠  Of all these three can Venus not a mind
‚Ä≠  Deceive, or set on forces to reflect.
‚Ä≠  Of all Pow‚Äôrs else yet, not a sex, nor sect,
‚Ä≠  Flies Venus; either of the blessed Gods,
‚Ä≠  Or men confin‚Äôd in mortal periods.
‚Ä≠  But even the mind of Jove she doth seduce,
‚Ä≠  That chides with thunder so her lawless use
‚Ä≠  In human creatures, and by lot is given
‚Ä≠  Of all most honour, both in earth and heaven.
‚Ä≠  And yet even his all-wise and mighty mind
‚Ä≠  She, when she lists, can forge affects to blind,
‚Ä≠  And mix with mortal dames his Deity,
‚Ä≠  Conceal‚Äôd at all parts from the jealous eye
‚Ä≠  Of Juno, who was both his sister born,
‚Ä≠  And made his wife; whom beauty did adorn
‚Ä≠  Past all the bevy of Immortal Dames,
‚Ä≠  And whose so chiefly-glorified flames
‚Ä≠  Cross-counsell‚Äôd Saturn got, and Rh√¶a bore,
‚Ä≠  And Jove‚Äôs pure counsels (being conqueror)
‚Ä≠  His wife made of his sister.  Ay, and more,
‚Ä≠  Cast such an amorous fire into her mind
‚Ä≠  As made her (like him) with the mortal kind
‚Ä≠  Meet in unmeet bed; using utmost haste,
‚Ä≠  Lest she should know that he lived so unchaste,
‚Ä≠  Before herself felt that fault in her heart,
‚Ä≠  And gave her tongue too just edge of desert
‚Ä≠  To tax his lightness.  With this end, beside,
‚Ä≠  Lest laughter-studying Venus should deride
‚Ä≠  The Gods more than the Goddesses, and say
‚Ä≠  That she the Gods commix‚Äôd in amorous play
‚Ä≠  With mortal dames, begetting mortal seed
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô immortal sires, and not make Goddesses breed
‚Ä≠  The like with mortal fathers.  But, t‚Äô acquite
‚Ä≠  Both Gods and Goddesses of her despite,
‚Ä≠  Jove took (even in herself) on him her pow‚Äôr,
‚Ä≠  And made her with a mortal paramour
‚Ä≠  Use as deform‚Äôd a mixture as the rest;
‚Ä≠  Kindling a kind affection in her breast
‚Ä≠  To God-like-limb‚Äôd Anchises, as he kept,
‚Ä≠  On Ida‚Äôs top-on-top-to-heaven‚Äôs-pole-heapt,  [1]
‚Ä≠  Amongst the many fountains there, his herd.
‚Ä≠  For, after his brave person had appear‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  To her bright eye, her heart flew all on fire,
‚Ä≠  And to amaze she burn‚Äôd in his desire,
‚Ä≠  Flew straight to Cyprus, to her odorous fane
‚Ä≠  And altars, that the people Paphian
‚Ä≠  Advanced to her.  Where, soon as enter‚Äôd, she
‚Ä≠  The shining gates shut; and the Graces three
‚Ä≠  Wash‚Äôd, and with oils of everlasting scent
‚Ä≠  Bathed, as became, her deathless lineament.
‚Ä≠  Then her ambrosian mantle she assum‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  With rich and odoriferous airs perfum‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Which being put on, and all her trims beside
‚Ä≠  Fair, and with all allurements amplified,
‚Ä≠  The all-of-gold-made laughter-loving Dame
‚Ä≠  Left odorous Cyprus, and for Troy became
‚Ä≠  A swift contendress, her pass cutting all
‚Ä≠  Along the clouds, and made her instant fall
‚Ä≠  On fountful Ida, that her mother-breasts
‚Ä≠  Gives to the preyful brood of savage beasts.
‚Ä≠  And through the hill she went the ready way
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô Anchises‚Äô oxstall, where did fawn and play
‚Ä≠  About her blessed feet wolves grisly-gray,
‚Ä≠  Terrible lions, many a mankind bear,
‚Ä≠  And lybberds swift, insatiate of red deer.
‚Ä≠  Whose sight so pleas‚Äôd, that, ever as she past,
‚Ä≠  Through every beast a kindly love she cast,
‚Ä≠  That, in their dens obscured with shadows deep,
‚Ä≠  Made all, distinguish‚Äôd in kind couples, sleep.
‚Ä≠     And now she reach‚Äôd the rich pavilion
‚Ä≠  Of the hero√´, in whom heavens had shown
‚Ä≠  A fair and goodly composition,
‚Ä≠  And whom she in his oxstall found, alone,
‚Ä≠  His oxen feeding in fat pastures by,
‚Ä≠  He walking up and down, sounds clear and high
‚Ä≠  From his harp striking.  Then before him she
‚Ä≠  Stood like a virgin, that invincibly
‚Ä≠  Had borne her beauties; yet alluringly
‚Ä≠  Bearing her person, lest his ravish‚Äôd eye
‚Ä≠  Should chance t‚Äô affect him with a stupid fear.
‚Ä≠  Anchises seeing her, all his senses were
‚Ä≠  With wonder stricken, and high-taken heeds
‚Ä≠  Both of her form, brave stature, and rich weeds.
‚Ä≠  For, for a veil, she shin‚Äôd in an attire
‚Ä≠  That cast a radiance past the ray of fire.
‚Ä≠  Beneath which wore she, girt to her, a gown
‚Ä≠  Wrought all with growing-rose-buds, reaching down
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô her slender smalls, which buskins did divine,
‚Ä≠  Such as taught Thetis‚Äô silver feet to shine.
‚Ä≠  Her soft white neck rich carquenets embraced,
‚Ä≠  Bright, and with gold in all variety graced,
‚Ä≠  That to her breasts let down lay there and shone,
‚Ä≠  As, at her joyful full, the rising Moon.
‚Ä≠  Her sight show‚Äôd miracles.  Anchises‚Äô heart
‚Ä≠  Love took into his hand, and made him part
‚Ä≠  With these high salutations;  ‚ÄúJoy, O Queen!
‚Ä≠  Whoever of the Blest thy beauties been
‚Ä≠  That light these entries; or the Deity
‚Ä≠  That darts affecteth; or that gave the Eye
‚Ä≠  Of heaven his heat and lustre; or that moves
‚Ä≠  The hearts of all with all-commanding loves;
‚Ä≠  Or generous Themis; or the blue-eyed Maid;
‚Ä≠  Or of the Graces any that are laid
‚Ä≠  With all the Gods in comparable scales,
‚Ä≠  And whom fame up to immortality calls;
‚Ä≠  Or any of the Nymphs, that unshorn groves,
‚Ä≠  Or that this fair hill-habitation, loves,
‚Ä≠  Or valleys flowing with earth‚Äôs fattest goods,
‚Ä≠  Or fountains pouring forth eternal floods!
‚Ä≠  Say, which of all thou art, that in some place
‚Ä≠  Of circular prospect, for thine eyes‚Äô dear grace,
‚Ä≠  I may an altar build, and to thy pow‚Äôrs
‚Ä≠  Make sacred all the year‚Äôs devoted hours,
‚Ä≠  With consecrations sweet and opulent.
‚Ä≠  Assur‚Äôd whereof, be thy benign mind bent
‚Ä≠  To these wish‚Äôd blessings of me:  Give me parts
‚Ä≠  Of chief attraction in Trojan hearts;
‚Ä≠  And, after, give me the refulgency
‚Ä≠  Of most renown‚Äôd and rich posterity;
‚Ä≠  Long, and free life, and heaven‚Äôs sweet light as long;
‚Ä≠  The people‚Äôs blessings, and a health so strong
‚Ä≠  That no disease it let my life engage,
‚Ä≠  Till th‚Äô utmost limit of a human age.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     To this Jove‚Äôs Seed this answer gave again;
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúAnchises!  Happiest of the human strain!
‚Ä≠  I am no Goddess!  Why, a thrall to death
‚Ä≠  Think‚Äôst thou like those that immortality breathe?
‚Ä≠  A woman brought me forth; my father‚Äôs name
‚Ä≠  Was Otre√ºs, if ever his high fame
‚Ä≠  Thine ears have witness‚Äôd, for he govern‚Äôd all
‚Ä≠  The Phrygian state, whose every town a wall
‚Ä≠  Impregnable embrac‚Äôd.  Your tongue, you hear,
‚Ä≠  I speak so well, that in my natural sphere
‚Ä≠  (As I pretend) it must have taken prime.
‚Ä≠  A woman, likewise, of the Trojan clime
‚Ä≠  Took of me, in her house, the nurse‚Äôs care
‚Ä≠  From my dear mother‚Äôs bosom; and thus are
‚Ä≠  My words of equal accent with your own.
‚Ä≠  How here I come, to make the reason known,
‚Ä≠  Argicides, that bears the golden rod,
‚Ä≠  Transferr‚Äôd me forcibly from my abode
‚Ä≠  Made with the maiden train of Her that joys
‚Ä≠  In golden shafts, and loves so well the noise
‚Ä≠  Of hounds and hunters (heaven‚Äôs pure-living Pow‚Äôr)
‚Ä≠  Where many a nymph and maid of mighty dow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  Chaste sports employ‚Äôd, all circled with a crown
‚Ä≠  Of infinite multitude, to see so shown
‚Ä≠  Our maiden pastimes.  Yet, from all the fair
‚Ä≠  Of this so forceful concourse, up in air
‚Ä≠  The golden-rod-sustaining Argus'-Guide
‚Ä≠  Rapt me in sight of all, and made me ride
‚Ä≠  Along the clouds with him, enforcing me
‚Ä≠  Through many a labour of mortality,
‚Ä≠  Through many an unbuilt region, and a rude,
‚Ä≠  Where savage beasts devour‚Äôd preys warm and crude,
‚Ä≠  And would not let my fears take one foot‚Äôs tread
‚Ä≠  On Her by whom are all lives comforted,
‚Ä≠  But said my maiden state must grace the bed
‚Ä≠  Of king Anchises, and bring forth to thee
‚Ä≠  Issue as fair as of divine degree.
‚Ä≠  Which said, and showing me thy moving grace,
‚Ä≠  Away flew he up to th‚Äô Immortal Race,
‚Ä≠  And thus came I to thee; Necessity,
‚Ä≠  With her steel stings, compelling me t‚Äô apply
‚Ä≠  To her high pow‚Äôr my will.  But you must I
‚Ä≠  Implore by Jove, and all the reverence due
‚Ä≠  To your dear parents, who, in bearing you,
‚Ä≠  Can bear no mean sail, lead me home to them
‚Ä≠  An untouch‚Äôd maid, being brought up in th‚Äô extreme
‚Ä≠  Of much too cold simplicity to know
‚Ä≠  The fiery cunnings that in Venus glow.
‚Ä≠  Show me to them then, and thy brothers born,
‚Ä≠  I shall appear none that parts disadorn,
‚Ä≠  But such as well may serve a brother‚Äôs wife,
‚Ä≠  And show them now, even to my future life,
‚Ä≠  If such or no my present will extend.
‚Ä≠  To horse-breed-vary‚Äông Phrygia likewise send,
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô inform my sire and mother of my state,
‚Ä≠  That live for me extreme disconsolate;
‚Ä≠  Who gold enough, and well-woven weeds, will give.
‚Ä≠  All whose rich gifts in my amends receive.
‚Ä≠  All this perform‚Äôd, and celebration then
‚Ä≠  Of honour‚Äôd nuptials, that by God and men
‚Ä≠  Are held in reverence.‚Äù  All this while she said,
‚Ä≠  Into his bosom jointly she convey‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The fires of love; when, all-enamour‚Äôd, he
‚Ä≠  In these terms answer‚Äôd:  ‚ÄúIf mortality
‚Ä≠  Confine thy fortunes, and a woman were
‚Ä≠  Mother to those attractions that appear
‚Ä≠  In thy admir‚Äôd form, thy great father given
‚Ä≠  High name of Otre√ºs; and the Spy of heaven
‚Ä≠  (Immortal Mercury) th‚Äô enforceful cause
‚Ä≠  That made thee lose the prize of that applause
‚Ä≠  That modesty immaculate virgins gives,
‚Ä≠  My wife thou shalt be call‚Äôd through both our lives.
‚Ä≠  Nor shall the pow‚Äôrs of men nor Gods withhold
‚Ä≠  My fiery resolution to enfold
‚Ä≠  Thy bosom in mine arms; which here I vow
‚Ä≠  To firm performance, past delay, and now.
‚Ä≠  Nor, should Apollo with his silver bow
‚Ä≠  Shoot me to instant death, would I forbear
‚Ä≠  To do a deed so full of cause so dear.
‚Ä≠  For with a heaven-sweet woman I will lie,
‚Ä≠  Though straight I stoop the house of Dis, and die.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, he took her hand, and she took way
‚Ä≠  With him, her bright eyes casting round; whose stay
‚Ä≠  She stuck upon a bed, that was before
‚Ä≠  Made for the king, and wealthy coverings wore.
‚Ä≠  On which bears‚Äô hides and big-voic‚Äôd lions‚Äô lay,
‚Ä≠  Whose preyful lives the king had made his prey,
‚Ä≠  Hunting th‚Äô Idalian hills.  This bed when they
‚Ä≠  Had both ascended, first he took from her
‚Ä≠  The fiery weed, that was her utmost wear;
‚Ä≠  Unbutton‚Äôd her next rosy robe; and loos‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The girdle that her slender waist enclos‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  Unlac‚Äôd her buskins; all her jewelry
‚Ä≠  Took from her neck and breasts, and all laid by
‚Ä≠  Upon a golden-studded chair of state.
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô amaze of all which being remov‚Äôd, even Fate
‚Ä≠  And council of the equal Gods gave way
‚Ä≠  To this, that with a deathless Goddess lay
‚Ä≠  A deathful man; since, what his love assum‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Not with his conscious knowledge was presum‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠     Now when the shepherds and the herdsmen, all,
‚Ä≠  Turn‚Äôd from their flow‚Äôry pasture to their stall,
‚Ä≠  With all their oxen, fat and frolic sheep,
‚Ä≠  Venus into Anchises cast a sleep,
‚Ä≠  Sweet and profound; while with her own hands now
‚Ä≠  With her rich weeds she did herself endow;
‚Ä≠  But so distinguish‚Äôd, that he clear might know
‚Ä≠  His happy glories; then (to her desire
‚Ä≠  Her heavenly person put in trims entire)
‚Ä≠  She by the bed stood of the well-built stall,
‚Ä≠  Advanc‚Äôd her head to state celestial,
‚Ä≠  And in her cheeks arose the radiant hue
‚Ä≠  Of rich-crown‚Äôd Venus to apparent view.
‚Ä≠  And then she rous‚Äôd him from his rest, and said:
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄúUp, my Dardanides, forsake thy bed.
‚Ä≠  What pleasure, late employ‚Äôd, lets humour steep
‚Ä≠  Thy lids in this inexcitable sleep?
‚Ä≠  Wake, and now say, if I appear to thee
‚Ä≠  Like her that first thine eyes conceited me.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This started him from sleep, though deep and dear,
‚Ä≠  And passing promptly he enjoy‚Äôd his ear.
‚Ä≠  But when his eye saw Venus‚Äô neck and eyes,
‚Ä≠  Whose beauties could not bear the counterprise
‚Ä≠  Of any other, down his own eyes fell,
‚Ä≠  Which pallid fear did from her view repell,
‚Ä≠  And made him, with a main respect beside,
‚Ä≠  Turn his whole person from her state, and hide
‚Ä≠  (With his rich weed appos‚Äôd) his royal face,
‚Ä≠  These wing‚Äôd words using:  ‚ÄúWhen, at first, thy grace
‚Ä≠  Mine eyes gave entertainment, well I knew
‚Ä≠  Thy state was deified; but thou told‚Äôst not true;
‚Ä≠  And therefore let me pray thee (by thy love
‚Ä≠  Borne to thy father, √Ügis-bearing Jove)
‚Ä≠  That thou wilt never let me live to be
‚Ä≠  An abject, after so divine degree
‚Ä≠  Taken in fortune, but take ruth on me,
‚Ä≠  For any man that with a Goddess lies,
‚Ä≠  Of interest in immortalities,
‚Ä≠  Is never long-liv‚Äôd.‚Äù  She replied:  ‚ÄúForbear,
‚Ä≠  O happiest of mortal men, this fear,
‚Ä≠  And rest assured, that (not for me, at least)
‚Ä≠  Thy least ills fear fits; no, nor for the rest
‚Ä≠  Of all the Blessed, for thou art their friend;
‚Ä≠  And so far from sustaining instant end,
‚Ä≠  That to thy long-enlarg‚Äôd life there shall spring
‚Ä≠  Amongst the Trojans a dear son, and king,
‚Ä≠  To whom shall many a son, and son‚Äôs son, rise
‚Ä≠  In everlasting great posterities;
‚Ä≠  His name √Üneas; therein keeping life,
‚Ä≠  For ever, in my much-conceited grief,
‚Ä≠  That I, immortal, fell into the bed
‚Ä≠  Of one whose blood mortality must shed.
‚Ä≠  But rest thou comforted, and all the race
‚Ä≠  That Troy shall propagate, in this high grace:
‚Ä≠  That, past all races else, the Gods stand near
‚Ä≠  Your glorious nation, for the forms ye bear,
‚Ä≠  And natures so ingenuous and sincere.
‚Ä≠  For which, the great-in-counsels (Jupiter)
‚Ä≠  Your gold-lock‚Äôd Ganymedes did transfer
‚Ä≠  (In rapture far from men‚Äôs depressed fates)
‚Ä≠  To make him consort with our Deified States,
‚Ä≠  And scale the tops of the Saturnian skies,
‚Ä≠  He was so mere a marvel in their eyes.
‚Ä≠  And therefore from a bowl of gold he fills
‚Ä≠  Red nectar, that the rude distension kills
‚Ä≠  Of winds that in your human stomachs breed.
‚Ä≠  But then did languor on the liver feed
‚Ä≠  Of Tros, his father, that was king of Troy,
‚Ä≠  And ever did his memory employ  [2]
‚Ä≠  With loss of his dear beauty so bereaven,
‚Ä≠  Though with a sacred whirlwind rapt to heaven.
‚Ä≠  But Jove, in pity of him, saw him given
‚Ä≠  Good compensation, sending by Heaven‚Äôs Spy
‚Ä≠  White-swift-hov‚Äôd horse, that Immortality
‚Ä≠  Had made firm-spirited; and had, beside,
‚Ä≠  Hermes to see his ambassy supplied
‚Ä≠  With this vow‚Äôd bounty (using all at large
‚Ä≠  That his unalter‚Äôd counsels gave in charge)
‚Ä≠  That he himself should immortality breathe,
‚Ä≠  Expert of age and woe as well as death.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúThis ambassy express‚Äôd, he mourn‚Äôd no more,
‚Ä≠  But up with all his inmost mind he bore,
‚Ä≠  Joying that he, upon his swift-hov‚Äôd horse,
‚Ä≠  Should be sustain‚Äôd in an eternal course.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúSo did the golden-throned Aurora raise,
‚Ä≠  Into her lap, another that the praise
‚Ä≠  Of an immortal fashion had in fame,
‚Ä≠  And of your nation bore the noble name,
‚Ä≠  (His title Tithon) who, not pleased with her,
‚Ä≠  As she his lovely person did transfer,
‚Ä≠  To satisfy him, she bade ask of Jove
‚Ä≠  The gift of an Immortal for her love.
‚Ä≠  Jove gave, and bound it with his bowed brow,
‚Ä≠  Performing to the utmost point his vow.
‚Ä≠  Fool that she was, that would her love engage,
‚Ä≠  And not as long ask from the bane of age
‚Ä≠  The sweet exemption, and youth‚Äôs endless flow‚Äôr!
‚Ä≠  Of which as long as both the grace and pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  His person entertain‚Äôd, she loved the man,
‚Ä≠  And (at the fluents of the ocean
‚Ä≠  Near Earth‚Äôs extreme bounds) dwelt with him; but when
‚Ä≠  According to the course of aged men)
‚Ä≠  On his fair head, and honourable beard,
‚Ä≠  His first grey hairs to her light eyes appear‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  She left his bed, yet gave him still for food
‚Ä≠  The Gods‚Äô ambrosia, and attire as good.
‚Ä≠  Till even the hate of age came on so fast
‚Ä≠  That not a lineament of his was grac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With pow‚Äôr of motion, nor did still sustain,
‚Ä≠  Much less, the vigour had t‚Äô advance a vein,
‚Ä≠  The virtue lost in each exhausted limb,
‚Ä≠  That at his wish before would answer him;
‚Ä≠  All pow‚Äôrs so quite decay‚Äôd, that when he spake
‚Ä≠  His voice no perceptible accent brake.
‚Ä≠  Her counsel then thought best to strive no more,
‚Ä≠  But lay him in his bed and lock his door.
‚Ä≠  Such an Immortal would not I wish thee,
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô extend all days so to eternity.
‚Ä≠  But if, as now, thou couldst perform thy course
‚Ä≠  In grace of form, and all corporeal force,
‚Ä≠  To an eternal date, thou then shouldst bear
‚Ä≠  My husband‚Äôs worthy name, and not a tear
‚Ä≠  Should I need rain, for thy deserts declin‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  From my all-clouded bitterness of mind.
‚Ä≠  But now the stern storm of relentless age
‚Ä≠  Will quickly circle thee, that waits t‚Äô engage
‚Ä≠  All men alike, even loathsomeness, and bane
‚Ä≠  Attending with it, every human wane,
‚Ä≠  Which even the Gods hate.  Such a penance lies
‚Ä≠  Impos‚Äôd on flesh and blood‚Äôs infirmities!
‚Ä≠  Which I myself must taste in great degree,
‚Ä≠  And date as endless, for consorting thee.
‚Ä≠  All the Immortals with my opprobry
‚Ä≠  Are full by this time; on their hearts so lie,
‚Ä≠  (Even to the sting of fear) my cunnings us‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And wiving conversations infus‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Into the bosoms of the best of them
‚Ä≠  With women, that the frail and mortal stream
‚Ä≠  Doth daily ravish.  All this long since done.
‚Ä≠  Which now no more, but with effusion
‚Ä≠  Of tears, I must in heaven so much as name,
‚Ä≠  I have so forfeited in this my fame,
‚Ä≠  And am impos‚Äôd pain of so great a kind
‚Ä≠  For so much erring from a Goddess‚Äô mind.
‚Ä≠  For I have put beneath my girdle here
‚Ä≠  A son, whose sire the human mortal sphere
‚Ä≠  Gives circumscription.  But, when first the light
‚Ä≠  His eyes shall comfort, Nymphs that haunt the height
‚Ä≠  Of hills, and breasts have of most deep receipt;
‚Ä≠  Shall be his nurses; who inhabit now
‚Ä≠  A hill of so vast and divine a brow,
‚Ä≠  As man nor God can come at their retreats;
‚Ä≠  Who live long lives, and eat immortal meats,
‚Ä≠  And with Immortals in the exercise
‚Ä≠  Of comely dances dare contend, and rise
‚Ä≠  Into high question which deserves the prize.
‚Ä≠  The light Sileni mix in love with these,
‚Ä≠  And, of all Spies the Prince, Argicides;
‚Ä≠  In well-trimm‚Äôd caves their secret meetings made.
‚Ä≠  And with the lives of these doth life invade
‚Ä≠  Or odorous fir-trees, or high-foreheaded oaks,
‚Ä≠  Together taking their begetting strokes,
‚Ä≠  And have their lives and deaths of equal dates,
‚Ä≠  Trees bearing lovely and delightsome states,
‚Ä≠  Whom Earth first feeds, that men initiates.
‚Ä≠  On her high hills she doth their states sustain,
‚Ä≠  And they their own heights raise as high again.
‚Ä≠  Their growths together made, Nymphs call their groves
‚Ä≠  Vow‚Äôd to th‚Äô Immortals services and loves;
‚Ä≠  Which men‚Äôs steels therefore touch not, but let grow.
‚Ä≠  But when wise Fates times for their fadings know,
‚Ä≠  The fair trees still before the fair Nymphs die,
‚Ä≠  The bark about them grown corrupt and dry,
‚Ä≠  And all their boughs fall‚Äôn yield to Earth her right;
‚Ä≠  And then the Nymphs‚Äô lives leave the lovely night,
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAnd these Nymphs in their caves shall nurse my son,
‚Ä≠  Whom (when in him youth‚Äôs first grace is begun)
‚Ä≠  The Nymphs, his nurses, shall present to thee;
‚Ä≠  And show thee what a birth thou hast by me.
‚Ä≠  And, sure as now I tell thee all these things,
‚Ä≠  When Earth hath cloth‚Äôd her plants in five fair springs,
‚Ä≠  Myself will make return to this retreat,
‚Ä≠  And bring that flow‚Äôr of thy enamour‚Äôd heat;
‚Ä≠  Whom when thou then seest, joy shall fire thine eyes;
‚Ä≠  He shall so well present the Deities.
‚Ä≠  And then into thine own care take thy son
‚Ä≠  From his calm seat to windy Ilion,
‚Ä≠  Where, if strict question be upon the past,
‚Ä≠  Asking what mother bore beneath her waist
‚Ä≠  So dear a son, answer, as I afford
‚Ä≠  Fit admonition, nor forget a word:
‚Ä≠  They say a Nymph, call‚Äôd Calucopides,
‚Ä≠  That is with others an inhabitress
‚Ä≠  On this thy wood-crown‚Äôd hill, acknowledges
‚Ä≠  That she his life gave.  But, if thou declare
‚Ä≠  The secret‚Äôs truth, and art so mad to dare
‚Ä≠  (In glory of thy fortunes) to approve
‚Ä≠  That rich-crown‚Äôd Venus mix‚Äôd with thee in love,
‚Ä≠  Jove, fired with my aspersion so dispread,
‚Ä≠  Will with a wreakful lightning dart thee dead.
‚Ä≠     ‚ÄúAll now is told thee, comprehend it all.
‚Ä≠  Be master of thyself, and do not call
‚Ä≠  My name in question; but with reverence vow
‚Ä≠  To Deities‚Äô angers all the awe ye owe.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     This said, She reach‚Äôd heaven, where airs ever flow.
‚Ä≠  And so, O Goddess, ever honour‚Äôd be,
‚Ä≠  In thy so odorous Cyprian empery!
‚Ä≠  My Muse, affecting first thy fame to raise,
‚Ä≠  Shall make transcension now to others‚Äô praise.

‚Ä≠  THE END OF THE FIRST HYMN TO VENUS

‚Ä≠[1] _·æøŒëŒ∫œÅŒøœÄ·ΩπŒªŒøœÇ.   Altissimum habens verticem, cujus summitas
‚Ä≠ipsum polum attingit._

‚Ä≠  TO THE SAME

‚Ä≠  The reverend, rich-crown‚Äôd, and fair Queen I sing,
‚Ä≠  Venus, that owes ill fate the fortressing
‚Ä≠  Of all maritimal Cyprus; where the force
‚Ä≠  Of gentle-breathing Zephyr steer‚Äôd her course
‚Ä≠  Along the waves of the resounding sea,
‚Ä≠  While, yet unborn, in that soft foam she lay
‚Ä≠  That brought her forth; whom those fair Hours that bear
‚Ä≠  The golden bridles joyfully stood near,
‚Ä≠  Took up into their arms, and put on her
‚Ä≠  Weeds of a never-corruptible wear.
‚Ä≠  On her immortal head a crown they plac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Elaborate, and with all the beauties grac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  That gold could give it; of a weight so great,
‚Ä≠  That, to impose and take off, it had set
‚Ä≠  Three handles on it, made, for endless hold,
‚Ä≠  Of shining brass, and all adorn‚Äôd with gold.
‚Ä≠  Her soft neck all with carquenets was grac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  That stoop‚Äôd, and both her silver breasts embrac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Which even the Hours themselves wear in resort
‚Ä≠  To Deities‚Äô dances, and her Father‚Äôs court.
‚Ä≠  Grac‚Äôd at all parts, they brought to heaven her graces;
‚Ä≠  Whose first sight seen, all fell into embraces,
‚Ä≠  Hugg‚Äôd her white hands, saluted, wishing all
‚Ä≠  To wear her maiden flow‚Äôr in festival
‚Ä≠  Of sacred Hymen, and to lead her home;
‚Ä≠  All, to all admiration, overcome
‚Ä≠  With Cytherea with the violet crown.
‚Ä≠     So to the Black-brow‚Äôd Sweet-spoke all renown!
‚Ä≠  Prepare my song, and give me, in the end,
‚Ä≠  The victory to whose palm all contend!
‚Ä≠  So shall my Muse for ever honour thee,
‚Ä≠  And, for thy sake, thy fair posterity.



‚Ä≠  BACCHUS, OR THE PIRATES

‚Ä≠  Of Dionysus, noble Semele‚Äôs Son,
‚Ä≠  I now intend to render mention,
‚Ä≠  As on a prominent shore his person shone,
‚Ä≠  Like to a youth whose flow‚Äôr was newly blown,
‚Ä≠  Bright azure tresses play‚Äôd about his head,
‚Ä≠  And on his bright broad shoulders was dispread
‚Ä≠  A purple mantle.  Strait he was descried
‚Ä≠  By certain manly pirates, that applied
‚Ä≠  Their utmost speed to prise him, being aboard
‚Ä≠  A well-built bark, about whose broad sides roar‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The wine-black Tyrrhene billows; death as black
‚Ä≠  Brought them upon him in their future wrack.
‚Ä≠  For, soon as they had purchas‚Äôd but his view,
‚Ä≠  Mutual signs past them, and ashore they flew,
‚Ä≠  Took him, and brought him instantly aboard,
‚Ä≠  Soothing their hopes to have obtain‚Äôd a hoard
‚Ä≠  Of riches with him; and a Jove-kept king
‚Ä≠  To such a flow‚Äôr must needs be natural spring.
‚Ä≠  And therefore straight strong fetters they must fetch,
‚Ä≠  To make him sure.  But no such strength would stretch
‚Ä≠  To his constrain‚Äôd pow‚Äôrs.  Far flew all their bands
‚Ä≠  From any least force done his feet or hands.
‚Ä≠  But he sat casting smiles from his black eyes
‚Ä≠  At all their worst.  At which discoveries
‚Ä≠  Made by the master, he did thus dehort
‚Ä≠  All his associates:  ‚ÄúWretches!  Of what sort
‚Ä≠  Hold ye the person ye assay to bind?
‚Ä≠  Nay, which of all the Pow‚Äôr fully-divin‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Esteem ye him, whose worth yields so much weight
‚Ä≠  That not our well-built bark will bear his freight?
‚Ä≠  Or Jove himself he is, or He that bears
‚Ä≠  The silver bow, or Neptune.  Nor appears
‚Ä≠  In him the least resemblance of a man,
‚Ä≠  But of a strain at least Olympian.
‚Ä≠  Come!  Make we quick dismission of his state,
‚Ä≠  And on the black-soil‚Äôd earth exonerate
‚Ä≠  Our sinking vessel of his deified load,
‚Ä≠  Nor dare the touch of an intangible God,
‚Ä≠  Lest winds outrageous, and of wrackful scathe,
‚Ä≠  And smoking tempests, blow his fiery wrath.‚Äù
‚Ä≠  This well-spoke master the tall captain gave
‚Ä≠  Hateful and horrible language; call‚Äôd him slave,
‚Ä≠  And bade him mark the prosp‚Äôrous gale that blew,
‚Ä≠  And how their vessel with her mainsail flew;
‚Ä≠  Bade all take arms, and said, their works requir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  The cares of men, and not of an inspir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Pure zealous master; his firm hopes being fir‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With this opinion, that they should arrive
‚Ä≠  In √Ügypt straight, or Cyprus, or where live
‚Ä≠  Men whose brave breaths above the north wind blow;
‚Ä≠  Yea, and perhaps beyond their region too.
‚Ä≠  And that he made no doubt but in the end
‚Ä≠  To make his prisoner tell him every friend
‚Ä≠  Of all his offspring, brothers, wealth, and all;
‚Ä≠  Since that prise, certain, must some God let fall.
‚Ä≠     This said, the mast and mainsail up he drew,
‚Ä≠  And in the mainsail‚Äôs midst a frank gale blew;
‚Ä≠  When all his ship took arms to brave their prise.
‚Ä≠  But straight strange works appear‚Äôd to all their eyes:
‚Ä≠  First, sweet wine through their swift-black bark did flow,
‚Ä≠  Of which the odours did a little blow
‚Ä≠  Their fiery spirits, making th‚Äô air so fine
‚Ä≠  That they in flood were there as well as wine.
‚Ä≠  A mere immortal-making savour rose,
‚Ä≠  Which on the air the Deity did impose.
‚Ä≠  The seamen see‚Äông all, admiration seiz‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  Yet instantly their wonders were increas‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  For on the topsail there ran, here and there,
‚Ä≠  A vine that grapes did in abundance bear,
‚Ä≠  And in an instant was the ship‚Äôs mainmast
‚Ä≠  With an obscure-green ivy‚Äôs arms embrac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  That flourish‚Äôd straight, and were with berries grac‚Äôd;
‚Ä≠  Of which did garlands circle every brow
‚Ä≠  Of all the pirates, and no one knew how.
‚Ä≠  Which when they saw, they made the master steer
‚Ä≠  Out to the shore; whom Bacchus made forbear,
‚Ä≠  With showing more wonders.  On the hatches He
‚Ä≠  Appear‚Äôd a terrible lion, horribly
‚Ä≠  Roaring; and in the mid-deck a male bear,
‚Ä≠  Made with a huge mane; making all, for fear,
‚Ä≠  Crowd to the stern, about the master there,
‚Ä≠  Whose mind he still kept dauntless and sincere,
‚Ä≠  But on the captain rush‚Äôd and ramp‚Äôd, with force
‚Ä≠  So rude and sudden, that his main recourse
‚Ä≠  Was to the main-sea straight: and after him
‚Ä≠  Leapt all his mates, as trusting to their swim
‚Ä≠  To fly foul death; but so found what they fled,
‚Ä≠  Being all to dolphins metamorphosed.
‚Ä≠  The master he took ruth of, sav‚Äôd, and made
‚Ä≠  The blessed‚Äôst man that ever tried his trade,
‚Ä≠  These few words giving him:  ‚ÄúBe confident,
‚Ä≠  Thou God-inspired pilot, in the bent
‚Ä≠  Of my affection, ready to requite
‚Ä≠  Thy late-to-me-intended benefit.
‚Ä≠  I am the roaring God of spritely wine,
‚Ä≠  Whom Semele (that did even Jove incline
‚Ä≠  To amorous mixture, and was Cadmus‚Äô care)
‚Ä≠  Made issue to the mighty Thunderer.‚Äù
‚Ä≠     And thus, all excellence of grace to thee,
‚Ä≠  Son of sweet-count‚Äônance-carry‚Äông Semele.
‚Ä≠  I must not thee forget in least degree,
‚Ä≠  But pray thy spirit to render so my song
‚Ä≠  Sweet, and all ways in order‚Äôd fury strong.



‚Ä≠  TO MARS

‚Ä≠  Mars, most-strong, gold-helm‚Äôd, making chariots crack;
‚Ä≠  Never without a shield cast on thy back;
‚Ä≠  Mind-master, town-guard, with darts never driven;
‚Ä≠  Strong-handed, all arms, fort, and fence of heaven;
‚Ä≠  Father of victory with fair strokes given;
‚Ä≠  Joint surrogate of justice, lest she fall
‚Ä≠  In unjust strifes a tyrant; general
‚Ä≠  Only of just men justly; that dost bear
‚Ä≠  Fortitude‚Äôs sceptre, to heaven‚Äôs fiery sphere
‚Ä≠  Giver of circular motion, between
‚Ä≠  That and the Pleiads that still wand‚Äôring been,
‚Ä≠  Where thy still-vehemently-flaming horse
‚Ä≠  About the third heaven make their fiery course;
‚Ä≠  Helper of mortals; hear!--As thy fires give
‚Ä≠  The fair and present boldnesses that strive
‚Ä≠  In youth for honour, being the sweet-beam‚Äôd light
‚Ä≠  That darts into their lives, from all their height,
‚Ä≠  The fortitudes and fortunes found in fight;
‚Ä≠  So would I likewise wish to have the pow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  To keep off from my head thy bitter hour,
‚Ä≠  And that false fire, cast from my soul‚Äôs low kind,
‚Ä≠  Stoop to the fit rule of my highest mind,
‚Ä≠  Controlling that so eager sting of wrath
‚Ä≠  That stirs me on still to that horrid scathe
‚Ä≠  Of war, that God still sends to wreak his spleen
‚Ä≠  (Even by whole tribes) of proud injurious men.
‚Ä≠     But O thou Ever-Blessed!  give me still
‚Ä≠  Presence of mind to put in act my will,
‚Ä≠  Varied, as fits, to all occasion;
‚Ä≠  And to live free, unforc‚Äôd, unwrought upon,
‚Ä≠  Beneath those laws of peace that never are
‚Ä≠  Affected with pollutions popular
‚Ä≠  Of unjust hurt, or loss to anyone;
‚Ä≠  And to bear safe the burthen undergone
‚Ä≠  Of foes inflexive, and inhuman hates,
‚Ä≠  Secure from violent and harmful fates.



‚Ä≠  TO DIANA

‚Ä≠  Diana praise, Muse, that in darts delights,
‚Ä≠  Lives still a maid, and had nutritial rights
‚Ä≠  With her born-brother, the far-shooting Sun.
‚Ä≠  That doth her all-of-gold-made chariot run
‚Ä≠  In chase of game, from Meles that abounds
‚Ä≠  In black-brow‚Äôd bulrushes, and, where her hounds
‚Ä≠  She first uncouples, joining there her horse,
‚Ä≠  Through Smyrna carried in most fiery course
‚Ä≠  To grape-rich Claros; where (ill his rich home,
‚Ä≠  And constant expectation She will come)
‚Ä≠  Sits Ph≈ìbus, that the silver bow doth bear,
‚Ä≠  To meet with Ph≈ìbe, that doth darts transfer
‚Ä≠  As far as He his shafts.  As far then be
‚Ä≠  Thy chaste fame shot, O Queen of archery!
‚Ä≠  Sacring my song to every Deity.



‚Ä≠  TO VENUS

‚Ä≠  To Cyprian Venus still my verses vow,
‚Ä≠  Who gifts as sweet as honey doth bestow
‚Ä≠  On all mortality; that ever smiles,
‚Ä≠  And rules a face that all foes reconciles;
‚Ä≠  Ever sustaining in her hand a flow‚Äôr
‚Ä≠  That all desire keeps ever in her pow‚Äôr.

‚Ä≠     Hail, then, O Queen of well-built Salamine,
‚Ä≠  And all the state that Cyprus doth confine,
‚Ä≠  Inform my song with that celestial fire
‚Ä≠  That in thy beauties kindles all desire.
‚Ä≠  So shall my Muse for ever honour thee,
‚Ä≠  And any other thou commend‚Äôst to me.



‚Ä≠  TO PALLAS

‚Ä≠  Pallas Minerva only I begin
‚Ä≠  To give my song; that makes war‚Äôs terrible din,
‚Ä≠  Is patroness of cities, and with Mars
‚Ä≠  Marshall‚Äôd in all the care and cure of wars,
‚Ä≠  And in everted cities, fights, and cries.
‚Ä≠  But never doth herself set down or rise
‚Ä≠  Before a city, but at both times She
‚Ä≠  All injur‚Äôd people sets on foot and free.
‚Ä≠     Give, with thy war‚Äôs force, fortune then to me,
‚Ä≠  And, with thy wisdom‚Äôs force, felicity.



‚Ä≠  TO JUNO

‚Ä≠  Saturnia, and her throne of gold, I sing,
‚Ä≠  That was of Rhea the eternal spring,
‚Ä≠  And empress of a beauty never yet
‚Ä≠  Equall‚Äôd in height of tincture.  Of the great
‚Ä≠  Saturnius (breaking air in awful noise)
‚Ä≠  The far-fam‚Äôd wife and sister; whom in joys
‚Ä≠  Of high Olympus all the Blessed love,
‚Ä≠  And honour equal with unequall‚Äôd Jove.



‚Ä≠  TO CERES

‚Ä≠  The rich-hair‚Äôd Ceres I assay to sing;
‚Ä≠  A Goddess, in whose grace the natural spring
‚Ä≠  Of serious majesty itself is seen;
‚Ä≠  And of the wedded, yet in grace still green,
‚Ä≠  Proserpina, her daughter, that displays
‚Ä≠  A beauty casting every way her rays.
‚Ä≠     All honour to thee, Goddess!  Keep this town;
‚Ä≠  And take thou chief charge of my song‚Äôs renown!



‚Ä≠  TO THE MOTHER OF THE GODS

‚Ä≠  Mother of all, both Gods and men, commend,
‚Ä≠  O Muse, whose fair form did from Jove descend;
‚Ä≠  That doth with cymbal sounds delight her life,
‚Ä≠  And tremulous divisions of the fife;
‚Ä≠  Love‚Äôs dreadful lions‚Äô roars, and wolves‚Äô hoarse howls,
‚Ä≠  Sylvan retreats, and hills, whose hollow knolls
‚Ä≠  Raise repercussive sounds about her ears.
‚Ä≠  And so may honour ever crown thy years
‚Ä≠  With all-else Goddesses, and ever be
‚Ä≠  Exalted in the Muses‚Äô harmony!



‚Ä≠  TO LION-HEARTED HERCULES

‚Ä≠  Alcides, forcefullest of all the brood
‚Ä≠  Of men enforc‚Äôd with need of earthy food,
‚Ä≠  My Muse shall memorise; the son of Jove,
‚Ä≠  Whom, in fair-seated Thebes (commix‚Äôd in love
‚Ä≠  With great heaven‚Äôs sable-cloud-assembling State)
‚Ä≠  Alcmena bore to him; and who, in date
‚Ä≠  Of days forepast, through all the sea was sent,
‚Ä≠  And Earth‚Äôs inenarrable continent,
‚Ä≠  To acts that king Eurystheus had decreed;
‚Ä≠  Did many a petulant and imperious deed
‚Ä≠  Himself, and therefore suffer‚Äôd many a toil;
‚Ä≠  Yet now inhabits the illustrious soil
‚Ä≠  Of white Olympus, and delights his life
‚Ä≠  With still-young Hebe, his well-ankled wife.
‚Ä≠     Hail, King, and Son of Jove!  Vouchsafe me
‚Ä≠  Virtue, and, her effect, felicity!



‚Ä≠  TO √ÜSCULAPIUS

‚Ä≠  With √Üsculapius, the physician,
‚Ä≠  That cur‚Äôd all sickness, and was Ph≈ìbus‚Äô son,
‚Ä≠  My Muse makes entry; to whose life gave yield
‚Ä≠  Divine Coronis in the Dotian field,
‚Ä≠  (King Phlegius‚Äô daughter) who much joy on men
‚Ä≠  Conferr‚Äôd, in dear ease of their irksome pain.
‚Ä≠  For which, my salutation, worthy king,
‚Ä≠  And vows to thee paid, ever when I sing!



‚Ä≠  TO CASTOR AND POLLUX

‚Ä≠  Castor and Pollux, the Tyndarides,
‚Ä≠  Sweet Muse illustrate; that their essences
‚Ä≠  Fetch from the high forms of Olympian Jove,
‚Ä≠  And were the fair fruits of bright Leda‚Äôs love,
‚Ä≠  Which she produc‚Äôd beneath the sacred shade
‚Ä≠  Of steep Taygetus, being subdu‚Äôd, and made
‚Ä≠  To serve th‚Äô affections of the Thunderer.
‚Ä≠  And so all grace to you, whom all aver
‚Ä≠  (For skill in horses, and their manage given)
‚Ä≠  To be the bravest horsemen under heaven!



‚Ä≠  TO MERCURY

‚Ä≠  Hermes I honour, the Cyllenian Spy,
‚Ä≠  King of Cyllenia, and of Arcady
‚Ä≠  With flocks abounding; and the Messenger
‚Ä≠  Of all th‚Äô Immortals, that doth still infer
‚Ä≠  Profits of infinite value to their store;
‚Ä≠  Whom to Saturnius bashful Maia bore,
‚Ä≠  Daughter of Atlas, and did therefore fly
‚Ä≠  Of all th‚Äô Immortals the society,
‚Ä≠  To that dark cave, where, in the dead of night,
‚Ä≠  Jove join‚Äôd with her in love‚Äôs divine delight,
‚Ä≠  When golden sleep shut Juno‚Äôs jealous eye,
‚Ä≠  Whose arms had wrists as white as ivory,
‚Ä≠  From whom, and all, both men and Gods beside,
‚Ä≠  The fair-hair‚Äôd nymph had scape kept undescried.
‚Ä≠     Joy to the Jove-got then, and Maia‚Äôs care,
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTwixt men and Gods the general Messenger,
‚Ä≠  Giver of good grace, gladness, and the flood
‚Ä≠  Of all that men or Gods account their good!



‚Ä≠  TO PAN

‚Ä≠  Sing, Muse, this chief of Hermes‚Äô love-got joys,
‚Ä≠  Goat-footed, two-horn‚Äôd, amorous of noise,
‚Ä≠  That through the fair greens, all adorn‚Äôd with trees,
‚Ä≠  Together goes with Nymphs, whose nimble knees
‚Ä≠  Can every dance foot, that affect to scale
‚Ä≠  The most inaccessible tops of all
‚Ä≠  Uprightest rocks, and ever use to call
‚Ä≠  On Pan, the bright-hair‚Äôd God of pastoral;
‚Ä≠  Who yet is lean and loveless, and doth owe
‚Ä≠  By lot all loftiest mountains crown‚Äôd with snow;
‚Ä≠  All tops of hills, and cliffy highnesses,
‚Ä≠  All sylvan copses, and the fortresses
‚Ä≠  Of thorniest queaches, here and there doth rove,
‚Ä≠  And sometimes, by allurement of his love,
‚Ä≠  Will wade the wat‚Äôry softnesses.  Sometimes
‚Ä≠  (In quite oppos‚Äôd _capriccios_) he climbs
‚Ä≠  The hardest rocks, and highest, every way
‚Ä≠  Running their ridges.  Often will convey
‚Ä≠  Himself up to a watch-tow‚Äôr‚Äôs top, where sheep
‚Ä≠  Have their observance.  Oft through hills as steep
‚Ä≠  His goats he runs upon, and never rests.
‚Ä≠  Then turns he head, and flies on savage beasts,
‚Ä≠  Mad of their slaughters; so most sharp an eye
‚Ä≠  Setting upon them, as his beams let fly
‚Ä≠  Through all their thickest tapistries.  And then
‚Ä≠  (When Hesp‚Äôrus calls to fold the flocks of men)
‚Ä≠  From the green clossets of his loftiest reeds
‚Ä≠  He rushes forth, and joy with song he feeds.
‚Ä≠  When, under shadow of their motions set,
‚Ä≠  He plays a verse forth so profoundly sweet,
‚Ä≠  As not the bird that in the flow‚Äôry spring,
‚Ä≠  Amidst the leaves set, makes the thickets ring
‚Ä≠  Of her sour sorrows, sweeten‚Äôd with her song,
‚Ä≠  Runs her divisions varied so and strong.
‚Ä≠  And then the sweet-voic‚Äôd Nymphs that crown his mountains
‚Ä≠  (Flock‚Äôd round about the deep-black-water‚Äôd fountains)
‚Ä≠  Fall in with their contention of song.
‚Ä≠  To which the echoes all the hills along
‚Ä≠  Their repercussions add.  Then here and there
‚Ä≠  (Plac‚Äôd in the midst) the God the guide doth bear
‚Ä≠  Of all their dances, winding in and out,
‚Ä≠  A lynce‚Äôs hide, besprinkled round about
‚Ä≠  With blood, cast on his shoulders.  And thus He,
‚Ä≠  With well-made songs, maintains th‚Äô alacrity
‚Ä≠  Of his free mind, in silken meadows crown‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With hyacinths and saffrons, that abound
‚Ä≠  In sweet-breath‚Äôd odours, that th‚Äô unnumber‚Äôd grass
‚Ä≠  (Besides their scents) give as through all they pass.
‚Ä≠  And these, in all their pleasures, ever raise
‚Ä≠  The blessed Gods‚Äô and long Olympus‚Äô praise:
‚Ä≠  Like zealous Hermes, who of all I said
‚Ä≠  Most profits up to all the Gods convey‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Who, likewise, came into th‚Äô Arcadian state,
‚Ä≠  (That‚Äôs rich in fountains, and all celebrate
‚Ä≠  For nurse of flocks,) where He had vow‚Äôd a grove
‚Ä≠  (Surnam‚Äôd Cyllenius) to his Godhead‚Äôs love.
‚Ä≠  Yet even himself (although a God he were)
‚Ä≠  Clad in a squalid sheepskin, govern‚Äôd there
‚Ä≠  A mortal‚Äôs sheep.  For soft love ent‚Äôring him
‚Ä≠  Conform‚Äôd his state to his conceited trim,
‚Ä≠  And made him long, in an extreme degree,
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô enjoy the fair-hair‚Äôd virgin Dryope.
‚Ä≠  Which ere he could, she made consummate
‚Ä≠  The flourishing rite of Hymen‚Äôs honour‚Äôd state;
‚Ä≠  And brought him such a piece of progeny
‚Ä≠  As show‚Äôd, at first sight, monstrous to the eye,
‚Ä≠  Goat-footed, two-horn‚Äôd, full of noise even then,
‚Ä≠  And (opposite quite to other childeren)
‚Ä≠  Told, in sweet laughter, he ought death no tear.
‚Ä≠  Yet straight his mother start, and fled, in fear,
‚Ä≠  The sight of so unsatisfying a thing,
‚Ä≠  In whose face put forth such a bristled spring.
‚Ä≠  Yet the most useful Mercury embrac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And took into his arms, his homely-fac‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Beyond all measure joyful with his sight;
‚Ä≠  And up to heaven with him made instant flight,
‚Ä≠  Wrapp‚Äôd in the warm skin of a mountain hare,
‚Ä≠  Set him by Jove, and made most merry fare
‚Ä≠  To all the Deities else with his son‚Äôs sight;
‚Ä≠  Which most of all fill‚Äôd Bacchus with delight;
‚Ä≠  And Pan they call‚Äôd him, since he brought to all
‚Ä≠  Of mirth so rare and full a festival.
‚Ä≠     And thus all honour to the shepherds‚Äô King,
‚Ä≠  For sacrifice to thee my Muse shall sing!



‚Ä≠  TO VULCAN

‚Ä≠  Praise Vulcan, now Muse; whom fame gives the prize
‚Ä≠  For depth and fracture of all forge-devise;
‚Ä≠  Who, with the sky-ey‚Äôd Pallas, first did give
‚Ä≠  Men rules of buildings, that before did live
‚Ä≠  In caves and dens, and hills, like savage beasts;
‚Ä≠  But now, by art-fam‚Äôd Vulcan‚Äôs interests
‚Ä≠  In all their civil industries, ways clear
‚Ä≠  Through th‚Äô all-things-bringing-to-their-ends (the year)
‚Ä≠  They work out to their ages‚Äô ends, at ease
‚Ä≠  Lodg‚Äôd in safe roofs from Winter‚Äôs utmost prease.
‚Ä≠     But, Vulcan, stand propitious to me,
‚Ä≠  Virtue safe granting, and felicity!



‚Ä≠  TO PH≈íBUS

‚Ä≠  O Ph≈ìbus!  Even the swan from forth her wings,
‚Ä≠  Jumping her proyning-bank, thee sweetly sings,
‚Ä≠  By bright Peneus‚Äô whirl-pit-making streams.
‚Ä≠  Thee, that thy lute mak‚Äôst sound so to thy beams,
‚Ä≠  Thee, first and last, the sweet-voic‚Äôd singer still
‚Ä≠  Sings, for thy song‚Äôs all-songs-transcending skill.
‚Ä≠  Thy pleasure, then, shall my song still supply,
‚Ä≠  And so salutes thee King of Poesy.



‚Ä≠  TO NEPTUNE

‚Ä≠  Neptune, the mighty marine God, I sing,
‚Ä≠  Earth‚Äôs mover, and the fruitless ocean‚Äôs King,
‚Ä≠  That Helicon and th‚Äô √Ügean deeps dost hold.
‚Ä≠  O thou Earth-shaker!  Thy command two-fold
‚Ä≠  The Gods have sorted;  making thee of horses
‚Ä≠  The awful tamer, and of naval forces
‚Ä≠  The Sure preserver.  Hail, O Saturn‚Äôs birth!
‚Ä≠  Whose graceful green hair circles all the earth.
‚Ä≠  Bear a benign mind; and thy helpful hand
‚Ä≠  Lend all submitted to thy dread command.



‚Ä≠  TO JOVE

‚Ä≠  Jove now I sing, the greatest and the best
‚Ä≠  Of all these Pow‚Äôrs that are with Deity blest,
‚Ä≠  That far-off doth his dreadful voice diffuse,
‚Ä≠  And, being King of all, doth all conduce
‚Ä≠  To all their ends.  Who (shut from all Gods else
‚Ä≠  With Themis, that the laws of all things tells)
‚Ä≠  Their fit composures to their times doth call,
‚Ä≠  Weds them together, and preserves this all.
‚Ä≠     Grace then, O far-heard Jove, the grace thou‚Äôst given,
‚Ä≠  Most Glorious, and most Great of Earth and Heaven!



‚Ä≠  TO VESTA

‚Ä≠  Vesta, that as a servant oversees
‚Ä≠  King Ph≈ìbus‚Äô hallow‚Äôd house, in all degrees
‚Ä≠  Of guide about it, on the sacred shore
‚Ä≠  Of heavenly Pythos, and hast evermore
‚Ä≠  Rich balms distilling from thy odorous hair,
‚Ä≠  Grace this house with thy housewifely repair!
‚Ä≠  Enter, and bring a mind that most may move,
‚Ä≠  Conferring even, the great in counsels, Jove;
‚Ä≠  And let my verse taste of your either‚Äôs love.



‚Ä≠  TO THE MUSES AND APOLLO

‚Ä≠  The Muses, Jove, and Ph≈ìbus, now I sing;
‚Ä≠  For from the far-off-shooting Ph≈ìbus spring
‚Ä≠  All poets and musicians, and from Jove
‚Ä≠  Th‚Äô ascents of kings.  The man the Muses love,
‚Ä≠  Felicity blesses; elocution‚Äôs choice
‚Ä≠  In syrup lay‚Äông of sweetest breath his voice.
‚Ä≠     Hail, Seed of Jove, my song your honours give,
‚Ä≠  And so in mine shall yours and others‚Äô live.



‚Ä≠  TO BACCHUS

‚Ä≠  Ivy-crown‚Äôd Bacchus iterate in thy praises,
‚Ä≠  O Muse; whose voice all loftiest echoes raises,
‚Ä≠  And he with all th‚Äô illustrious Seed of Jove
‚Ä≠  Is join‚Äôd in honour, being the fruit of love
‚Ä≠  To him, and Semele the-great-in-graces;
‚Ä≠  And from the King his father‚Äôs kind embraces
‚Ä≠  By fair-hair‚Äôd Nymphs was taken to the dales
‚Ä≠  Of Nyssa, and with curious festivals.
‚Ä≠  Given his fair grought, far from his father‚Äôs view,
‚Ä≠  In caves from whence eternal odours flew,
‚Ä≠  And in high number of the Deities plac‚Äôd.
‚Ä≠  Yet when the many-hymn-given God had past
‚Ä≠  His Nurses‚Äô cares, in ivies and in bays
‚Ä≠  All over thicketed, his varied ways
‚Ä≠  To sylvan coverts evermore He took,
‚Ä≠  With all his Nurses, whose shrill voices shook
‚Ä≠  Thickets, in which could no foot‚Äôs entry fall,
‚Ä≠  And he himself made captain of them all.
‚Ä≠     And so, O grape-abounding Bacchus, be
‚Ä≠  Ever saluted by my Muse and me!
‚Ä≠  Give us to spend with spirit our hours out here,
‚Ä≠  And every hour extend to many a year.



‚Ä≠  TO DIANA

‚Ä≠  Diana, that the golden spindle moves,
‚Ä≠  And lofty sounds as well as Bacchus loves,
‚Ä≠  A bashful virgin, and of fearful hearts
‚Ä≠  The death-affecter with delighted darts,
‚Ä≠  By sire and mother Ph≈ìbus‚Äô sister born,
‚Ä≠  Whose thigh the golden falchion doth adorn,
‚Ä≠  I sing; who likewise over hills of shade
‚Ä≠  And promontories that vast winds invade,
‚Ä≠  Amorous of hunting, bends her all-gold bow,
‚Ä≠  And sigh-begetting arrows doth bestow
‚Ä≠  In fates so dreadful that the hill-tops quake,
‚Ä≠  And bristled woods their leafy foreheads shake,
‚Ä≠  Horrors invade earth, and [the] fishy seas
‚Ä≠  Impassion‚Äôd furies; nothing can appease
‚Ä≠  The dying brays of beasts.  And her delight
‚Ä≠  In so much death affects so with affright
‚Ä≠  Even all inanimate natures; for, while she
‚Ä≠  Her sports applies, their general progeny
‚Ä≠  She all ways turns upon to all their banes.
‚Ä≠  Yet when her fiery pleasures find their wanes,
‚Ä≠  Her yielding bow unbent, to th‚Äô ample house,
‚Ä≠  Seated in Delphos, rich and populous,
‚Ä≠  Of her dear brother, her retreats advance.
‚Ä≠  Where th‚Äô instauration of delightsome dance
‚Ä≠  Amongst the Muses and the Graces she
‚Ä≠  Gives form; in which herself the regency
‚Ä≠  (Her unbent bow hung up, and casting on
‚Ä≠  A gracious robe) assumes, and first sets gone
‚Ä≠  The dances‚Äô entry; to which all send forth
‚Ä≠  Their heavenly voices, and advance the worth
‚Ä≠  Of her fair-ankled mother, since to light
‚Ä≠  She children brought the far most exquisite
‚Ä≠  In counsels and performances of all
‚Ä≠  The Goddesses that grace the heavenly hall.
‚Ä≠     Hail then, Latona‚Äôs fair-hair‚Äôd Seed, and Jove‚Äôs!
‚Ä≠  My song shall ever call to mind your loves.



‚Ä≠  TO PALLAS

‚Ä≠  Pallas-Minerva‚Äôs deity, the renown‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  My Muse in her variety must resound;
‚Ä≠  Mighty in councils; whose illustrous eyes
‚Ä≠  In all resemblance represent the skies.
‚Ä≠  A reverend maid of an inflexible mind;
‚Ä≠  In spirit and person strong; of triple kind;
‚Ä≠  Fautress of cities that just laws maintain;
‚Ä≠  Of Jove, the-great-in-councils, very brain
‚Ä≠  Took prime existence, his unbounded brows
‚Ä≠  Could not contain her, such impetuous throes
‚Ä≠  Her birth gave way to, that abroad she flew,
‚Ä≠  And stood, in gold arm‚Äôd, in her Father‚Äôs view,
‚Ä≠  Shaking her sharp lance.  All Olympus shook
‚Ä≠  So terribly beneath her, that it took
‚Ä≠  Up in amazes all the Deities there.
‚Ä≠  All earth resounded with vociferous fear.
‚Ä≠  The sea was put up all in purple waves,
‚Ä≠  And settled suddenly her rudest raves.
‚Ä≠  Hyperion‚Äôs radiant son his swift-hov‚Äôd steeds
‚Ä≠  A mighty time stay‚Äôd, till her arming weeds,
‚Ä≠  As glorious as the Gods‚Äô, the blue-ey‚Äôd Maid
‚Ä≠  Took from her deathless shoulders; but then stay‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  All these distempers, and heaven‚Äôs counsellor, Jove,
‚Ä≠  Rejoic‚Äôd that all things else his stay could move.
‚Ä≠     So I salute thee still; and still in praise
‚Ä≠  Thy fame, and others‚Äô, shall my memory raise.



‚Ä≠  TO VESTA AND MERCURY

‚Ä≠  Vesta I sing, who, in bequest of fate,
‚Ä≠  Art sorted out an everlasting state
‚Ä≠  In all th‚Äô Immortals‚Äô high-built roofs, and all
‚Ä≠  Those of earth-dwelling men, as general
‚Ä≠  And ancient honours given thee for thy gift
‚Ä≠  Of free-liv‚Äôd chastity, and precious thrift.
‚Ä≠  Nor can there amongst mortals banquets be,
‚Ä≠  In which, both first and last, they give not thee
‚Ä≠  Their endless gratitudes in pour‚Äôd-out wine,
‚Ä≠  As gracious sacrifice to thy divine
‚Ä≠  And useful virtues; being invok‚Äôd by all,
‚Ä≠  Before the least taste of their festival
‚Ä≠  In wine or food affect their appetites.
‚Ä≠  And Thou, that of th‚Äô adorn‚Äôd-with-all-delights
‚Ä≠  Art the most useful angel, born a God
‚Ä≠  Of Jove and Maia, of heaven‚Äôs golden rod
‚Ä≠  The sole sustainer, and hast pow‚Äôr to bless
‚Ä≠  With all good all men, great Argicides,
‚Ä≠  Inhabit all good houses, see‚Äông no wants
‚Ä≠  Of mutual minds‚Äô love in th‚Äô inhabitants,
‚Ä≠  Join in kind blessing with the bashful maid
‚Ä≠  And all-lov‚Äôd virgin, Vesta; either‚Äôs aid
‚Ä≠  Combin‚Äôd in every hospitable house;
‚Ä≠  Both being best seen in all the gracious
‚Ä≠  House-works of mortals.  Jointly follow then,
‚Ä≠  Even from their youths, the minds of dames and men.
‚Ä≠     Hail then, old Daughter of the oldest God,
‚Ä≠  And thou Great Bearer of Heaven‚Äôs golden rod!
‚Ä≠  Yet not to you alone my vows belong,
‚Ä≠  Others as well claim th‚Äô homage of my song.



‚Ä≠  TO EARTH, THE MOTHER OF ALL

‚Ä≠  Mother of all things, the well-founded Earth,
‚Ä≠  My Muse shall memorize; who all the birth
‚Ä≠  Gives food that all her upper regions breed,
‚Ä≠  All that in her divine diffusions feed
‚Ä≠  In under continents, all those that live
‚Ä≠  In all the seas, and all the air doth give
‚Ä≠  Wing‚Äôd expeditions, of thy bounties eat;
‚Ä≠  Fair children, and fair fruits, thy labour‚Äôs sweat,
‚Ä≠  O great in reverence; and referr‚Äôd to thee,
‚Ä≠  For life and death is all the pedigree
‚Ä≠  Of mortal humans.  Happy then is he
‚Ä≠  Whom the innate propensions of thy mind
‚Ä≠  Stand bent to honour.  He shall all things find
‚Ä≠  In all abundance; all his pastures yield
‚Ä≠  Herds in all plenties; all his roofs are fill‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With rich possessions; he, in all the sway
‚Ä≠  Of laws best order‚Äôd, cuts out his own way
‚Ä≠  In cities shining with delicious dames,
‚Ä≠  And takes his choice of all those striving flames;
‚Ä≠  High happiness and riches, like his train,
‚Ä≠  Follow his fortunes, with delights that reign
‚Ä≠  In all their princes; glory invests his sons;
‚Ä≠  His daughters, with their crown‚Äôd selections
‚Ä≠  Of all the city, frolic through the meads,
‚Ä≠  And everyone her call‚Äôd-for dances treads
‚Ä≠  Along the soft-flow‚Äôr of the claver-grass.
‚Ä≠  All this, with all those, ever comes to pass,
‚Ä≠  That thy love blesses, Goddess full of grace,
‚Ä≠  And treasurous Angel t‚Äô all the human race.
‚Ä≠     Hail, then, Great Mother of the Deified Kind,
‚Ä≠  Wife to the cope of stars!  Sustain a mind
‚Ä≠  Propitious to me for my praise, and give
‚Ä≠  (Answering my mind) my vows fit means to live.



‚Ä≠  TO THE SUN

‚Ä≠  The radiant Sun‚Äôs divine renown diffuse,
‚Ä≠  Jove‚Äôs daughter, great Calliope, my Muse;
‚Ä≠  Whom ox-ey‚Äôd Eurypha√´ssa gave birth
‚Ä≠  To the bright Seed of starry Heaven and Earth.
‚Ä≠  For the far-fam‚Äôd Hyperion took to wife
‚Ä≠  His sister Eurypha√´ssa, that life
‚Ä≠  Of his high race gave to these lovely three:
‚Ä≠  Aurora, with the rosy-wrists; and She
‚Ä≠  That owns th‚Äô enamouring tresses, the bright Moon;
‚Ä≠  Together with the never-wearied Sun,
‚Ä≠  Who (his horse mounting) gives both mortals light
‚Ä≠  And all th‚Äô Immortals.  Even to horror, bright
‚Ä≠  A blaze burns from his golden burgonet,
‚Ä≠  Which to behold exceeds the sharpest set
‚Ä≠  Of any eye‚Äôs intention, beams so clear
‚Ä≠  It all ways pours abroad.  The glorious cheer
‚Ä≠  Of his far-shining face up to his crown
‚Ä≠  Casts circular radiance, that comes streaming down
‚Ä≠  About his temples, his bright cheeks, and all,
‚Ä≠  Retaining the refulgence of their fall.
‚Ä≠  About his bosom flows so fine a weed
‚Ä≠  As doth the thinness of the wind exceed
‚Ä≠  In rich context; beneath whose deep folds fly
‚Ä≠  His masculine horses round about the sky,
‚Ä≠  Till in this hemisphere he renders stay
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô his gold-yok‚Äôd coach and coursers; and his way,
‚Ä≠  Let down by heaven, the heavenly coachman makes
‚Ä≠  Down to the ocean, where his rest he takes.
‚Ä≠     My salutations then, fair King, receive,
‚Ä≠  And in propitious returns relieve
‚Ä≠  My life with mind-fit means; and then from thee,
‚Ä≠  And all the race of complete Deity,
‚Ä≠  My song shall celebrate those half-god States,
‚Ä≠  That yet sad death‚Äôs condition circulates,
‚Ä≠  And whose brave acts the Gods show men that they
‚Ä≠  As brave may aim at, since they can but die.



‚Ä≠  TO THE MOON

‚Ä≠  The Moon, now, Muses, teach me to resound,
‚Ä≠  Whose wide wings measure such a world of ground;
‚Ä≠  Jove‚Äôs daughter, deck‚Äôd with the mellifluous tongue,
‚Ä≠  And seen in all the sacred art of song.
‚Ä≠  Whose deathless brows when she from heaven displays,
‚Ä≠  All earth she wraps up in her orient rays.
‚Ä≠  A heaven of ornament in earth is rais‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  When her beams rise.  The subtle air is sais‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  Of delicate splendour from her crown of gold.
‚Ä≠  And when her silver bosom is extoll‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  Wash‚Äôd in the ocean, in day‚Äôs equall‚Äôd noon
‚Ä≠  Is midnight seated; but when she puts on
‚Ä≠  Her far-off-sprinkling-lustre evening weeds,
‚Ä≠  (The month is two cut; her high-breasted steeds
‚Ä≠  Man‚Äôd all with curl‚Äôd flames, put in coach and all,
‚Ä≠  Her huge orb fill‚Äôd,) her whole trims then exhale
‚Ä≠  Unspeakable splendours from the glorious sky.
‚Ä≠  And out of that state mortal men imply
‚Ä≠  Many predictions.  And with her then,
‚Ä≠  In love mix‚Äôd, lay the King of Gods and men;
‚Ä≠  By whom made fruitful, she Pandea bore,
‚Ä≠  And added her state to th‚Äô Immortal Store.
‚Ä≠  Hail, Queen, and Goddess, th‚Äô ivory-wristed Moon
‚Ä≠  Divine, prompt, fair-hair‚Äôd!  With thy grace begun,
‚Ä≠  My Muse shall forth, and celebrate the praise
‚Ä≠  Of men whose states the Deities did raise
‚Ä≠  To semi-deities; whose deeds t‚Äô endless date
‚Ä≠  Muse-lov‚Äôd and sweet-sung poets celebrate.



‚Ä≠  TO CASTOR AND POLLUX

‚Ä≠  Jove‚Äôs fair Sons, father‚Äôd by th‚Äô Oebalian king,
‚Ä≠  Muses well-worth-all men‚Äôs beholdings, sing!
‚Ä≠  The dear birth that bright-ankl‚Äôd Leda bore;
‚Ä≠  Horse-taming Castor, and, the conqueror
‚Ä≠  Of tooth-tongu‚Äôd Momus, Pollux; whom beneath
‚Ä≠  Steep-brow‚Äôd Taygetus she gave half-god breath,
‚Ä≠  In love mix‚Äôd with the black-clouds King of Heaven;
‚Ä≠  Who, both of men and ships, being tempest driven,
‚Ä≠  When Winter‚Äôs wrathful empire is in force
‚Ä≠  Upon th‚Äô implacable seas, preserve the course.
‚Ä≠  For when the gusts begin, if near the shore,
‚Ä≠  The seamen leave their ship, and, evermore
‚Ä≠  Bearing two milk-white lambs aboard, they now
‚Ä≠  Kill them ashore, and to Jove‚Äôs issue vow,
‚Ä≠  When though their ship, in height of all the roar
‚Ä≠  The winds and waves confound, can live no more
‚Ä≠  In all their hopes, then suddenly appear
‚Ä≠  Jove‚Äôs saving Sons, who both their bodies bear
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôTwixt yellow wings down from the sparkling pole,
‚Ä≠  Who straight the rage of those rude winds control,
‚Ä≠  And all the high-waves couch into the breast
‚Ä≠  Of th‚Äô hoary seas.  All which sweet signs of rest
‚Ä≠  To seamen‚Äôs labours their glad souls conceive,
‚Ä≠  And end to all their irksome grievance give.
‚Ä≠     So, once more, to the swift-horse-riding race
‚Ä≠  Of royal Tyndarus, eternal grace!



‚Ä≠  TO MEN OF HOSPITALITY

‚Ä≠  Reverence a man with use propitious
‚Ä≠  That hospitable rites wants; and a house
‚Ä≠  (You of this city with the seat of state
‚Ä≠  To ox-ey‚Äôd Juno vow‚Äôd) yet situate
‚Ä≠  Near Pluto‚Äôs region.  At the extreme base
‚Ä≠  Of whose so high-hair‚Äôd city, from the race
‚Ä≠  Of blue-wav‚Äôd Hebrus lovely fluent, grac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  With Jove‚Äôs begetting, you divine cups taste.



‚Ä≠  EPIGRAMS

‚Ä≠  TO CUMA

‚Ä≠  Lend hospitable rites and house-respect,
‚Ä≠  You that the virgin with the fair eyes deckt
‚Ä≠  Make fautress of your stately-seated town,
‚Ä≠  At foot of Sardes, with the high-hair‚Äôd crown,
‚Ä≠  Inhabiting rich Cuma; where ye taste
‚Ä≠  Of Hermus‚Äô heavenly fluent, all embrac‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By curl‚Äôd-head whirl pits; and whose waters move
‚Ä≠  From the divine seed of immortal Jove.



‚Ä≠  IN HIS RETURN TO CUMA

‚Ä≠  Swiftly my feet sustain me to the town,
‚Ä≠  Where men inhabit whom due honours crown,
‚Ä≠  Whose minds with free-given faculties are mov‚Äôd,
‚Ä≠  And whose grave counsels best of best approv‚Äôd.



‚Ä≠  UPON THE SEPULCHRE OF MIDUS
‚Ä≠  CUT IN BRASS, IN THE FIGURE OF A VIRGIN

‚Ä≠  A maid of brass I am, infixed here
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô eternize honest Midus‚Äô sepulchre;
‚Ä≠  And while the stream her fluent seed receives,
‚Ä≠  And steep trees curl their verdant brows with leaves,
‚Ä≠  While Ph≈ìbus rais‚Äôd above the earth gives sight,
‚Ä≠  And th‚Äô humorous Moon takes lustre from his light,
‚Ä≠  While floods bear waves, and seas shall wash the shore,
‚Ä≠  At this his sepulchre, whom all deplore,
‚Ä≠  I‚Äôll constantly abide; all passers by
‚Ä≠  Informing, ‚ÄúHere doth honest Midus lie.‚Äù



‚Ä≠  CUMA

‚Ä≠  REFUSING HIS OFFER TO ETERNIZE THEIR STATE,
‚Ä≠  THOUGH BROUGHT THITHER BY THE MUSES

‚Ä≠  O to what fate hath Father Jove given o‚Äôer
‚Ä≠  My friendless life, born ever to be poor!
‚Ä≠  While in my infant state he pleas‚Äôd to save me,
‚Ä≠  Milk on my reverend mother‚Äôs knees he gave me,
‚Ä≠  In delicate and curious nursery;
‚Ä≠  √Üolian Smyrna, seated near the sea,
‚Ä≠  (Of glorious empire, and whose bright sides
‚Ä≠  Sacred Meletus‚Äô silver current glides,)
‚Ä≠  Being native seat to me.  Which, in the force
‚Ä≠  Of far-past time, the breakers of wild horse,
‚Ä≠  Phriconia‚Äôs noble nation, girt with tow‚Äôrs;
‚Ä≠  Whose youth in fight put on with fiery pow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  From hence, the Muse-maids, Jove‚Äôs illustrous Seed,
‚Ä≠  Impelling me, I made impetuous speed,
‚Ä≠  And went with them to Cuma, with intent
‚Ä≠  T‚Äô eternize all the sacred continent
‚Ä≠  And state of Cuma.  They, in proud ascent
‚Ä≠  From off their bench, refus‚Äôd with usage fierce
‚Ä≠  The sacred voice which I aver is verse.
‚Ä≠  Their follies, yet, and madness borne by me,
‚Ä≠  Shall by some pow‚Äôr be thought on futurely,
‚Ä≠  To wreak of him whoever, whose tongue sought
‚Ä≠  With false impair my fall.  What fate God brought
‚Ä≠  Upon my birth I‚Äôll bear with any pain,
‚Ä≠  But undeserv‚Äôd defame unfelt sustain.
‚Ä≠  Nor feels my person (dear to me though poor)
‚Ä≠  Any great lust to linger any more
‚Ä≠  In Cuma‚Äôs holy highways; but my mind
‚Ä≠  (No thought impair‚Äôd, for cares of any kind
‚Ä≠  Borne in my body) rather vows to try
‚Ä≠  The influence of any other sky,
‚Ä≠  And spirits of people bred in any land
‚Ä≠  Of ne‚Äôer so slender and obscure command.



‚Ä≠  AN ASSAY OF HIS BEGUN ILIADS

‚Ä≠  Ilion, and all the brave-horse-breeding soil,
‚Ä≠  Dardania, I sing; that many a toil
‚Ä≠  Impos‚Äôd upon the mighty Grecian pow‚Äôrs,
‚Ä≠  Who were of Mars the manly servitours.



‚Ä≠  TO THESTOR‚ÄôS SON  [1]
‚Ä≠  INQUISITIVE OF HOMER ABOUT THE CAUSES OF THINGS
‚Ä≠  Thestorides!  of all the skills unknown
‚Ä≠  To errant mortals, there remains not one
‚Ä≠  Of more inscrutable affair to find
‚Ä≠  Than is the true state of a human mind.

‚Ä≠[1] Homer intimated, in this his answer to Thestorides, a will to have
‚Ä≠him learn the knowledge of himself, before he inquired so
‚Ä≠curiously the causes of other things.  And from hence had the great
‚Ä≠peripatetic, Themistius, his most grave epiphoneme, _Anima qu√¶
‚Ä≠seipsam ignorat, quid sciret ipsa de aliis?_ And, therefore,
‚Ä≠according to Aristotle, advises all philosophical students to begin
‚Ä≠with that study.



‚Ä≠  TO NEPTUNE

‚Ä≠  Hear, pow‚Äôrful Neptune, that shak‚Äôst earth in ire,
‚Ä≠  King of the great green, where dance all the quire
‚Ä≠  Of fair-hair‚Äôd Helicon; give prosperous gales;
‚Ä≠  And good pass, to these guiders of our sails,
‚Ä≠  Their voyage rend‚Äôring happily directed,
‚Ä≠  And their return with no ill fate affected.
‚Ä≠  Grant likewise at rough Mimas‚Äô lowest roots,
‚Ä≠  Whose strength up to her tops pr√¶rupt rocks shoots,
‚Ä≠  My passage safe arrival; and that I
‚Ä≠  My bashful disposition may apply
‚Ä≠  To pious men, and wreak myself upon
‚Ä≠  The man whose verbal circumvention
‚Ä≠  In me did wrong t‚Äô hospitious Jove‚Äôs whole state,
‚Ä≠  And th‚Äô hospitable table violate.



‚Ä≠  TO THE CITY ERYTHR√ÜA

‚Ä≠  Worshipful Earth, Giver of all things good!
‚Ä≠  Giver of even felicity; whose flood
‚Ä≠  The mind all-over steeps in honeydew;
‚Ä≠  That to some men dost infinite kindness shew,
‚Ä≠  To others that despise thee art a shrew,
‚Ä≠  And giv‚Äôst them gamester‚Äôs galls; who, once their main
‚Ä≠  Lost with an ill chance, fare like abjects slain.



‚Ä≠  TO MARINERS

‚Ä≠  Ye wave-trod watermen, as ill as she
‚Ä≠  That all the earth in infelicity
‚Ä≠  Of rapine plunges; who upon your fare
‚Ä≠  As sterv‚Äôd-like-ravenous as cormorants are;
‚Ä≠  The lives ye lead, but in the worst degree,
‚Ä≠  Not to be envied more than misery;
‚Ä≠  Take shame, and fear the indignation
‚Ä≠  Of Him that thunders from the highest throne,
‚Ä≠  Hospitious Jove, who, at the back, prepares
‚Ä≠  Pains of abhorr‚Äôd effect of him that dares
‚Ä≠  The pieties break of his hospitious squares.



‚Ä≠  THE PINE

‚Ä≠  Any tree else bears better fruit than thee,
‚Ä≠  That Ida‚Äôs tops sustain, where every tree
‚Ä≠  Bears up in air such perspirable heights,
‚Ä≠  And in which caves and sinuous receipts
‚Ä≠  Creep in such great abundance.  For about
‚Ä≠  Thy foots, that ever all thy fruits put out,
‚Ä≠  As nourish‚Äôd by them, equal with thy fruits,
‚Ä≠  Pour Mars‚Äôs iron-mines their accurs‚Äôd pursuits.
‚Ä≠  So that when any earth-encroaching man,
‚Ä≠  Of all the martial brood Cebrenian,
‚Ä≠  Plead need of iron, they are certain still
‚Ä≠  About thy roots to satiate every will.



‚Ä≠  TO GLAUCUS

‚Ä≠  WHO WAS SO MISERABLY SPARING THAT HE FEARED
‚Ä≠  ALL MEN‚ÄôS ACCESS TO HIM

‚Ä≠  Glaucus!  though wise enough, yet one word more
‚Ä≠  Let my advice add to thy wisdom‚Äôs store,
‚Ä≠  For ‚Äôtwill be better so:  Before thy door
‚Ä≠  Give still thy mastiffs meat, that will be sure
‚Ä≠  To lie there, therefore, still, and not endure
‚Ä≠  (With waylaid ears) the softest foot can fall,
‚Ä≠  But men and beasts make fly thee and thy stall.



‚Ä≠  AGAINST THE SAMIAN MINISTRESS, OR NUN
‚Ä≠
‚Ä≠  Hear me, O Goddess, that invoke thine ear,
‚Ä≠  Thou that dost feed and form the youthful year,
‚Ä≠  And grant that this dame may the loves refuse,
‚Ä≠  And beds, of young men, and affect to use
‚Ä≠  Humans whose temples hoary hairs distain,
‚Ä≠  Whose pow‚Äôrs are passing coy, whose wills would fain.



‚Ä≠  WRITTEN ON THE COUNCIL CHAMBER

‚Ä≠  Of men, sons are the crowns of cities‚Äô tow‚Äôrs;
‚Ä≠  Of pastures, horse are the most beauteous flow‚Äôrs;
‚Ä≠  Of seas, ships are the grace; and money still
‚Ä≠  With trains and titles doth the family fill.
‚Ä≠  But royal counsellors, in council set,
‚Ä≠  Are ornaments past all, as clearly great
‚Ä≠  As houses are that shining fires enfold,
‚Ä≠  Superior far to houses nak‚Äôd and cold.



‚Ä≠  THE FURNACE CALLED IN TO SING BY POTTERS

‚Ä≠  If ye deal freely, O my fiery friends,
‚Ä≠  As ye assure, I‚Äôll sing, and serve your ends.
‚Ä≠  Pallas, vouchsafe thou here invok‚Äôd access, I
‚Ä≠  Impose thy hand upon this Forge, and bless
‚Ä≠  All cups these artists earn so, that they may
‚Ä≠  Look black still with their depth, and every way
‚Ä≠  Give all their vessels a most sacred sale.
‚Ä≠  Make all well-burn‚Äôd; and estimation call
‚Ä≠  Up to their prices.  Let them market well,
‚Ä≠  And in all highways in abundance sell,
‚Ä≠  Till riches to their utmost wish arise,
‚Ä≠  And, as thou mak‚Äôst them rich, so make me wise.
‚Ä≠     But if ye now turn all to impudence,
‚Ä≠  And think to pay with lies my patience,
‚Ä≠  Then will I summon ‚Äôgainst your Furnace all
‚Ä≠  Hell‚Äôs harmfull‚Äôst spirits; Maragus I‚Äôll call,
‚Ä≠  Sabactes, Asbett, and Omadamus,
‚Ä≠  Who ills against your art innumerous
‚Ä≠  Excogitates, supplies, and multiplies.
‚Ä≠  Come, Pallas, then, and all command to rise,
‚Ä≠  Infesting forge and house with fire, till all
‚Ä≠  Tumble together, and to ashes fall,
‚Ä≠  These potters selves dissolv‚Äôd in tears as small.
‚Ä≠  And as a horse-cheek chides his foaming bit,
‚Ä≠  So let this Forge murmur in fire and flit,
‚Ä≠  And all this stuff to ashy ruins run.
‚Ä≠  And thou, O Circe, daughter of the Sun,
‚Ä≠  Great-many-poison-mixer, come, and pour
‚Ä≠  Thy cruell‚Äôst poisons on this Potters‚Äô floor,
‚Ä≠  Shivering their vessels; and themselves affect
‚Ä≠  With all the mischiefs possible to direct
‚Ä≠  ‚ÄôGainst all their beings, urg‚Äôd by all thy fiends.
‚Ä≠  Let Chiron likewise come; and all those friends
‚Ä≠  (The Centaurs) that Alcides‚Äô fingers fled,
‚Ä≠  And all the rest too that his hand strook dead,
‚Ä≠  (Their ghosts excited) come, and macerate
‚Ä≠  These earthen men; and yet with further fate
‚Ä≠  Affect their Furnace; all their tear-burst eyes
‚Ä≠  Seeing and mourning for their miseries,
‚Ä≠  While I look on, and laugh their blasted art
‚Ä≠  And them to ruin.  Lastly, if apart
‚Ä≠  Any lies lurking, and sees yet, his face
‚Ä≠  Into a coal let th‚Äô angry fire embrace,
‚Ä≠  That all may learn by them, in all their lust,
‚Ä≠  To dare deeds great, to see them great and just.



‚Ä≠  EIRESIONE, OR, THE OLIVE BRANCH

‚Ä≠  The turrets of a man of infinite might,
‚Ä≠  Of infinite action, substance infinite,
‚Ä≠  We make access to; whose whole being rebounds
‚Ä≠  From earth to heaven, and nought but bliss resounds.
‚Ä≠  Give entry then, ye doors; more riches yet
‚Ä≠  Shall enter with me; all the Graces met
‚Ä≠  In joy of their fruition, perfect peace
‚Ä≠  Confirming all; all crown‚Äôd with such increase,
‚Ä≠  That every empty vessel in your house
‚Ä≠  May stand replete with all things precious;
‚Ä≠  Elaborate Ceres may your larders fill
‚Ä≠  With all dear delicates, and serve in still;
‚Ä≠  May for your son a wife make wish‚Äôd approach
‚Ä≠  Into your tow‚Äôrs, and rapt in in her coach
‚Ä≠  With strong-kneed mules; may yet her state prove staid,
‚Ä≠  With honour‚Äôd housewiferies; her fair hand laid
‚Ä≠  To artful loomworks; and her nak‚Äôd feet tread
‚Ä≠  The gum of amber to a golden bead.
‚Ä≠     But I‚Äôll return; return, and yet not press
‚Ä≠  Your bounties now assay‚Äôd with oft access,
‚Ä≠  Once a year only, as the swallow prates
‚Ä≠  Before the wealthy Spring‚Äôs wide open gates.
‚Ä≠  Meantime I stand at yours, nor purpose stay
‚Ä≠  More time t‚Äô entreat.  Give, or not give, away
‚Ä≠  My feet shall bear me, that did never come
‚Ä≠  With any thought to make your house my home.



‚Ä≠  TO CERTAIN FISHER BOYS

‚Ä≠  PLEASING HIM WITH INGENIOUS RIDDLES

‚Ä≠  Yet from the bloods even of your self-like sires
‚Ä≠  Are you descended, that could make ye heirs
‚Ä≠  To no huge hoards of coin, nor leave ye able
‚Ä≠  To feed flocks of innumerable rabble.

‚Ä≠  THE END OF ALL THE ENDLESS WORKS OF HOMER.



‚Ä≠  THE TRANSLATOR‚ÄôS EPILOGUE

‚Ä≠  _The work that I was born to do is done!
‚Ä≠  Glory to Him that the conclusion
‚Ä≠  Makes the beginning of my life; and never
‚Ä≠  Let me be said to live, till I live ever.
‚Ä≠     Where‚Äôs the outliving of my fortunes then,
‚Ä≠  Ye errant vapours of Fame‚Äôs Lernean fen,
‚Ä≠  That, like possess‚Äôd storms, blast all not in herd
‚Ä≠  With your abhorr‚Äôd heads; who, because cashier‚Äôd
‚Ä≠  By men for monsters, think men monsters all,
‚Ä≠  That are not of your pied Hood and your Hall,
‚Ä≠  When you are nothing but the scum of things,
‚Ä≠  And must be cast off; drones, that have no stings;
‚Ä≠  Nor any more soul than a stone hath wings?
‚Ä≠     Avaunt, ye hags!  Your hates and scandals are
‚Ä≠  The crowns and comforts of a good man‚Äôs care;
‚Ä≠  By whose impartial perpendicular,
‚Ä≠  All is extuberance, and excretion all,
‚Ä≠  That you your ornaments and glories call.
‚Ä≠  Your wry mouths censure right!  Your blister‚Äôd tongues,
‚Ä≠  That lick but itches!  And whose ulcerous lungs
‚Ä≠  Come up at all things permanent and sound!
‚Ä≠  O you, like flies in dregs, in humours drown‚Äôd!
‚Ä≠  Your loves, like atoms, lost in gloomy air,
‚Ä≠  I would not retrieve with a wither‚Äôd hair.
‚Ä≠  Hate, and cast still your stings then, for your kisses
‚Ä≠  Betray but truth, and your applauds are hisses.
‚Ä≠     To see our supercilious wizards frown,
‚Ä≠  Their faces fall‚Äôn like fogs, and coming down,
‚Ä≠  Stinking the sun out, makes me shine the more;
‚Ä≠  And like a check‚Äôd flood bear above the shore,
‚Ä≠  That their profane opinions fain would set
‚Ä≠  To what they see not, know not, nor can let.
‚Ä≠  Yet then our learn‚Äôd men with their torrents come,
‚Ä≠  Roaring from their forc‚Äôd hills, all crown‚Äôd with foam,
‚Ä≠  That one not taught like them, should learn to know
‚Ä≠  Their Greek roots, and from thence the groves that grow,
‚Ä≠  Casting such rich shades from great Homer‚Äôs wings,
‚Ä≠  That first and last command the Muses‚Äô springs.
‚Ä≠  Though he‚Äôs best scholar, that, through pains and vows
‚Ä≠  Made his own master only, all things knows.
‚Ä≠  Nor pleads my poor skill form, or learned place,
‚Ä≠  But dauntless labour, constant prayer, and grace.
‚Ä≠  And what‚Äôs all their skill, but vast varied reading?
‚Ä≠  As if broad-beaten highways had the leading
‚Ä≠  To Truth‚Äôs abstract, and narrow path, and pit;
‚Ä≠  Found in no walk of airy worldly wit.
‚Ä≠  And without Truth, all‚Äôs only sleight of hand,
‚Ä≠  Or our law-learning in a foreign land,
‚Ä≠  Embroidery spent on cobwebs, braggart show
‚Ä≠  Of men that all things learn, and nothing know.
‚Ä≠  For ostentation humble Truth still flies,
‚Ä≠  And all confederate fashionists defies.
‚Ä≠  And as some sharp-brow‚Äôd doctor, English born,
‚Ä≠  In much learn‚Äôd Latin idioms can adorn
‚Ä≠  A verse with rare attractions, yet become
‚Ä≠  His English Muse like an Arachnean loom,
‚Ä≠  Wrought spite of Pallas, and therein bewrays
‚Ä≠  More tongue than truth, begs, and adopts his bays;
‚Ä≠  So Ostentation, be he never so
‚Ä≠  Larded with labour to suborn his show,
‚Ä≠  Shall sooth within him but a bastard soul,
‚Ä≠  No more heaven heiring than, Earth‚Äôs son, the mole,
‚Ä≠  But as in dead calms emptiest smokes arise,
‚Ä≠  Uncheck‚Äôd and free, up straight into the skies;
‚Ä≠  So drowsy Peace, that in her humour steeps
‚Ä≠  All she affects, lets such rise while she sleeps.
‚Ä≠  Many, and most men, have of wealth least store,
‚Ä≠  But none the gracious shame that fits the poor.
‚Ä≠  So most learn‚Äôd men enough are ignorant,
‚Ä≠  But few the grace have to confess their want,
‚Ä≠  Till lives and learnings come concomitant.
‚Ä≠  Far from men‚Äôs knowledges their lives‚Äô-acts flow;
‚Ä≠  Vainglorious acts then vain prove all they know.
‚Ä≠  As night the life-inclining stars best shows,
‚Ä≠  So lives obscure the starriest souls disclose.
‚Ä≠     For me, let just men judge by what I show
‚Ä≠  In acts expos‚Äôd how much I err or know;
‚Ä≠  And let not envy make all worse than nought,
‚Ä≠  With her mere headstrong and quite brainless thought,
‚Ä≠  Others, for doing nothing, giving all,
‚Ä≠  And bounding all worth in her bursten gall.
‚Ä≠     God and my dear_ Redeemer _rescue me
‚Ä≠  From men‚Äôs immane and mad impiety,
‚Ä≠  And by my life and soul (sole known to Them)
‚Ä≠  Make me of palm, or yew, an anadem.
‚Ä≠  And so my sole_ God, _the_ Thrice-Sacred-Trine,
‚Ä≠  _Bear all th‚Äô ascription of all me and mine._

‚Ä≠Supplico tibi, Domine, Pater, et Dux rationis nostr√¶, ut nostr√¶
‚Ä≠nobilitatis recordemur qu√¢ Tu nos ornasti; et ut Tu nobis pr√¶st√≥ sis,
‚Ä≠ut iis qui per sese moventur; ut et √† corporis contagio,
‚Ä≠brutorumque affectuum, repurgemur, eosque superemus, atque
‚Ä≠regamus, et, sicut decet, pro instrumentis iis utamur. Deinde, ut
‚Ä≠nobis adjumento sis, ad accuratam rationis nostr√¶ correctionem, et
‚Ä≠conjunctionem cum iis qui ver√® sunt per lucem veritatis.  Et
‚Ä≠terti√πm, Salvatori supplex oro, ut ab oculis animorum nostrorum,
‚Ä≠caliginem prorsus abstergas, ut norimus bene qui Deus, aut
‚Ä≠mortalis, habendus.  _Amen._

‚Ä≠  _Sine honore vivam, nulloque numera ero._
