The Tailor and the Crow:
An Old Rhyme
with
New Drawings
by
London
New York
_Printed in Great Britain._
A carrion crow sat on an oak,
Fol de riddle, lol de riddle, hi ding do,
Watching a tailor shape his cloak;
Sing heigh ho,
the carrion crow,
Fol de riddle,
lol de riddle,
hi ding do.
Wife,
bring me my old bent bow,
Fol de riddle,
lol de riddle,
hi
ding do.
That I may shoot yon carrion crow;
Sing heigh ho, the carrion crow,
Fol de riddle, lol de riddle, hi ding do.
The tailor he shot
and missed his mark,
Fol de riddle,
lol de riddle,
hi ding
do.
And shot his own sow quite through the heart;
Sing heigh ho, the carrion crow,
Fol de riddle, lol de riddle, hi ding do.
Wife, bring brandy in a spoon,
Fol de riddle,
lol de riddle,
hi-ding do.
For our old sow
is in a swoon;
Sing
the carrion crow,
Fol de riddle, lol de riddle, hi ding
do.
