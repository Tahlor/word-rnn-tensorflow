Rock of Ages
The Lord is my rock
and my fortress.  2 Sam. XXII 2.
Rock of ages cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and blood,
From thy riven side which flow'd,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.
Not the labors of my hands
Can fulfil Thy laws demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
All for sin could not atone,
Thou must save, and Thou alone,
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die.
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyelids close in death,
When I soar thro' tracts unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in thee.
