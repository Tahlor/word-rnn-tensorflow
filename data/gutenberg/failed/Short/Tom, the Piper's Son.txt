|Tom, he was a piper's son,
`He learn'd to play when he was
```young;
`The only tune that he could play
`Was Over the hills and far away.=
`Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
``Stole a pig, and away he run;
`The pig was eat Tom was beat,
``And Tom ran roaring down
```the street.=
`Here is a long tailed pig, or a
```short tailed pig, all sorts of
```pigs for sale:
`A boar pig, or a sow pig, or a
```pig with a curly tail.=
`All the little girls and boys
``Were so delighted with his
```noise,
`They'd dance and sing, while he
```did play
``Over the hills and far away.=
`Tom now learn'd another tune,
``"The cow that jumped o'er the
```moon."
`It made the horned cattle prance,
``And caused the sleepy pigs to
```dance.=
`Tom saw a donkey pass along,
`Then played a little merry song;
`The donkey danc'd about the
```road,
`And soon was lighten'd of his
```load.=
`Tom, next met a pretty lass,
``Tending cows upon the grass
`He tuned his pipe, which caused
```much fun.=
`The cow, she danced, the maid
```she run.
`Dame Trot went out to sell her
```eggs.
`He used his pipe, and she her legs
`Her eggs were very sadly broke,
``While wicked Tom enjoy'd
```the joke.=
`Tom met the parson on his way,
``Took out his pipe, began to
```play,
`A merry tune, that led his grace
``Into a very dirty place.=
`The mayor then said, he would
```not fail
``To send poor Tommy off to jail
`Tom took his pipe, began to play,
``And all the court soon danc'd
```away.=
`'Twas quite a treat to see the rout
``How clerks and judges hop-
```ped about.=
`Policeman Grab, who held him
```fast,
``Began to dance about at last;
`Whilst Tom delighted at the
```fun,
``Slipped out of court, and off
```did run.=
````Finis.
