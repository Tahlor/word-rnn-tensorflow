An Elegy
on the Glory of Her Sex
by
Dr. Oliver Goldsmith
*       *       *       *       *
Good people all,
with one accord,
Lament for
Madam Blaize,
Who never wanted
a good word--
_From those_
_who spoke her praise._
The needy seldom pass'd her door,
And always found her kind;
She freely lent to all the poor--
_Who left_
_a pledge behind._
She strove the neighbourhood to please
With manners wondrous winning;
And never follow'd wicked ways--
_Unless when she was sinning._
At church, in silks and satins new,
With hoop of monstrous size,
She never slumber'd in her pew--
_But when she shut her eyes._
Her love was sought, I do aver,
By twenty beaux and more;
The King himself has follow'd her--
_When she has walk'd before._
But now, her wealth and finery fled,
Her hangers-on cut short-all:
The Doctors found, when she was dead
_Her last disorder mortal._
Let us lament, in sorrow sore,
For Kent Street well may say,
That had she lived a twelvemonth more,--
_She had not died to-day._
