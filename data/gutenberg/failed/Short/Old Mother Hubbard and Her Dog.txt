Old Mother Hubbard
Went to the cupboard,
To give her poor Dog a bone,
When she came there
The cupboard was bare,
And so the poor Dog had none.

She went to the Tavern,
For white wine and red,
When she came back
The Dog stood on his head.
She brought him a cake
Which she bought at the Fair,
When she came back
The Dog sat in a chair.
She went to the Baker's
To buy him some bread,
When she came back
Poor Doggy was dead.
She went to the Undertaker's
To buy him a coffin,
When she came back
The Dog was laughing.
She took a clean dish
To get him some tripe,
When she came back
He was smoking his pipe.
She went to the Tailor's
To buy him a coat,
When she came back,
He was riding a goat.
She went to the Fruiterer's
To buy him some fruit,
When she came back,
He was playing the flute.
She went to the Barber's
To buy him a wig,
When she came back
He was dancing a jig.
She went to the Cobbler's
To buy him some shoes,
When she came back
He was reading the news.
She went to the Hatter's
To buy him a hat,
When she came back
He was feeding her cat.
She went to the Sempstress
To buy him some linen,
When she came back
The Dog was spinning.
She went to the Hosier's
To buy him some hose,
When she came back
He was drest in his clothes.
The Dame made a curtsey,
The Dog made a bow,
The Dame said 'your servant,'
The Dog said 'bow wow.'
