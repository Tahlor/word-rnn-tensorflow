Index of Psychology
The Art of Biography
Is different from Geography.
Geography is about Maps,
But Biography is about Chaps.
Sir Christopher Wren
Said, "I am going to dine with some men.
"If anybody calls
"Say I am designing St. Paul's."
The people of Spain think Cervantes
Equal to half-a-dozen Dantes:
An opinion resented most bitterly
By the people of Italy.
Mr Bernard Shaw
Was just setting out for the war,
When he heard it was a dangerous trade
And demonstrably underpaid.
Sir Humphrey Davy
Abominated gravy.
He lived in the odium
Of having discovered Sodium.
John Stuart Mill,
By a mighty effort of will,
Overcame his natural bonhomie
And wrote "Principles of Political Economy."
The Abbe Liszt
Hit the piano with his fist.
That was the way
He used to play.
What I like about Clive
Is that he is no longer alive.
There is a great deal to be said
For being dead.
Edward the Confessor
Slept under the dresser.
When that began to pall,
He slept in the hall.
Dr Clifford
And I have differed.
He disapproves of gin:
I disapprove of sin.
Chapman & Hall
Swore not at all.
Mr Chapman's yea was yea,
And Mr Hall's nay was nay.
Karl Marx
Was completely wrapped up in his sharks.
The poor creatures seriously missed him
While he was attacking the capitalist system.
The great Emperor Otto
Could not decide upon a motto.
His mind wavered between
"L'Etat C'est Moi" and "Ich Dien."
Guglielmo Marconi
Was brought up on macaroni,
But when he gets it now
There's no end of a row.
That you have all heard of Hume
I tacitly assume;
But you didn't know, perhaps,
That his parents were Lapps.
Mr Hilaire Belloc
Is a case for legislation ad hoc.
He seems to think nobody minds
His books being all of different kinds.
It is understood that Job
Never read "The Globe;"
But nothing could be higher than
His opinion of Leviathan.
The views of Pizarro
Were perhaps a little narrow.
He killed the Caciques
Because (he said) they were sneaks.
It looked bad when the Duke of Fife
Left off using a knife;
But people began to talk
When he left off using a fork.
The great Duke of Wellington
Reduced himself to a skellington.
He reached seven stone two,
And then----Waterloo!
I do not extenuate Bunyan's
Intemperate use of onions,
But if I knew a wicked ogress
I would lend her "The Pilgrim's Progress."
When I faced the bowling of Hirst
I ejaculated, "Do your worst!"
He said, "Right you are, Sid."
----And he did.
After dinner, Erasmus
Told Colet not to be "blas'mous"
Which Colet, with some heat,
Requested him to repeat.
Sir (then Mr) Walter Besant
Would never touch pheasant,
But Mr James Rice
Thought it so nice.
When the great Titian
Was in a critical condition,
He was carefully nursed
By Francis the First.
Professor Dewar
Is a better man than you are.
None of you asses
Can condense gases.
Sir Walter Raleigh
Bickered down the valley.
But he could do better than the rill,
For he could bicker up-hill.
The novels of Jane Austen
Are the ones to get lost in.
*       *       *       *       *
I wonder if Labby
Has read "Northanger Abbey?"
Archbishop Odo
Was just in the middle of "Dodo,"
When he remembered that it was Sunday.
"Sic transit gloria mundi."
The intrepid Ricardo
With characteristic bravado,
Alluded openly to Rent
Wherever he went.
Sir Thomas a Mallory
Always went to the gallery.
He said, not without nous,
That it was the best place in the house.
Mr Alfred Beit
Screamed suddenly in the night.
When they asked him why
He made no reply.
When they told Cimabue
He didn't know how to cooee,
He replied, "Perhaps I mayn't,
But I do know how to paint."
If only Mr Roosevelt
Knew how officers in the Blues felt,
He wouldn't be so rife
With his Strenuous Life.
People wondered why Harley
Sang "Wae's me for Prince Charlie."
"It is childish," they said, "to mourn
For a person not yet born."
Sir Alexander Acland-Hood
Believed in Free Food:
But he was Eleusinian
About this opinion.
I am not Mahomet.
----Far from it.
That is the mistake
All of you seem to make.
The musician Grieg
Joined the Primrose League.
It gave him the idea of his chorus,
"The Unburied Ichthyosaurus."
The younger Van Eyck
Was christened Jan, and not Mike.
The thought of this curious mistake
Often kept him awake.
Mr Werner Laurie
Is not at all sorry
He undertook the publication
Of this instructive compilation.
(_In all work of a biographic character it is important to make
copious reference to as many as possible of the generally-recognised
virtues, vices, good points, foibles, peculiarities, tricks,
characteristics, little weaknesses, traits, imperfections, fads,
idiosyncrasies, singularities, morbid symptoms, oddities, faults, and
regrettable propensities set forth in the following table. The form
of an alphabetic index, with references to the examples given in the
preceding pages, has been chosen, so that the beginner who may be
desirous, when trying his hand at work of this sort, of seeing how any
given one of these subjects may best be treated, is enabled at once to
turn to one or more model passages._)
