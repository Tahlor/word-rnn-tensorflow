Part the
Second]
Here's johnny Bull From England come,
Who boasts of being a sailor,
But yankey tars will let him know,
He'll meet with many a Failure.
The Elephant upright and tall
Dress'd up in Eastern style Sir
His efforts here to show himself
I think will make you smile Sir
Here's Bruin next from Russia come,
Dont let him you affright, =Sir=
Tho in his manner rather rough
You'll find him here polite, =Sir=
Now here is somebody indeed!!
You'll know him I'll engage Sir,
If not, I'll tell who it is,
Tis Boney in a Cage Sir.
Here's Somebody and Nobody,
To make you smile and laugh Sir,
Which you'll allow than crying is,
Much better far by half Sir.
A learned Dog you now behold
Much more so than his betters,
Do you by him example take
And study well your Letters.
To close the Show and thoroughly
To please you and content ye,
And give all due Variety
With Tumbling we present ye.
