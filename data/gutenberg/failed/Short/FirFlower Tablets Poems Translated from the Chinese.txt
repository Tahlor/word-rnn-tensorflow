_Poems translated from the Chinese by_
_Hon. Mem. North China Branch, Royal Asiatic Society_
_The Riverside Press, Cambridge_
Let me state at the outset that I know no Chinese. My duty in Mrs.
Ayscough's and my joint collaboration has been to turn her literal
translations into poems as near to the spirit of the originals as it was
in my power to do. It has been a long and arduous task, but one which
has amply repaid every hour spent upon it. To be suddenly introduced to
a new and magnificent literature, not through the medium of the usual
more or less accurate translation, but directly, as one might burrow it
out for one's self with the aid of a dictionary, is an exciting and
inspiring thing. The method we adopted made this possible, as I shall
attempt to show. The study of Chinese is so difficult that it is a
life-work in itself, so is the study of poetry. A sinologue has no time
to learn how to write poetry; a poet has no time to learn how to read
Chinese. Since neither of us pretended to any knowledge of the other's
craft, our association has been a continually augmenting pleasure.
I was lucky indeed to approach Chinese poetry through such a medium. The
translations I had previously read had given me nothing. Mrs. Ayscough
has been to me the pathway to a new world. No one could be a more
sympathetic go-between for a poet and his translator, and Mrs. Ayscough
was well-fitted for her task. She was born in Shanghai. Her father, who
was engaged in business there, was a Canadian and her mother an
American. She lived in China until she was eleven, when her parents
returned to America in order that their children might finish their
education in this country. It was then that I met her, so that our
friendship is no new thing, but has persisted, in spite of distance, for
more than thirty years, to ripen in the end into a partnership which is
its culmination. Returning to China in her early twenties, she became
engaged to an Englishman connected with a large British importing house
in Shanghai, and on her marriage, which took place almost immediately,
went back to China, where she has lived ever since. A diligent student
of Chinese life and manners, she soon took up the difficult study of
literary Chinese, and also accepted the position of honorary librarian
of the library of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.
Of late years, she has delivered a number of lectures on Chinese
subjects in China, Japan, America, and Canada, and has also found time
to write various pamphlets on Chinese literature and customs.
In the Autumn of 1917, Mrs. Ayscough arrived in America on one of her
periodic visits to this country. She brought with her a large collection
of Chinese paintings for exhibition, and among these paintings were a
number of examples of the "Written Pictures." Of these, she had made
some rough translations which she intended to use to illustrate her
lectures. She brought them to me with a request that I put them into
poetic shape. I was fascinated by the poems, and, as we talked them
over, we realized that here was a field in which we should like to work.
When she returned to China, it was agreed that we should make a volume
of translations from the classic Chinese writers. Such translations were
in the line of her usual work, and I was anxious to read the Chinese
poets as nearly in the original as it was possible for me to do. At
first, we hardly considered publication. Mrs. Ayscough lives in Shanghai
and I in Boston, and the war-time mails were anything but expeditious,
but an enthusiastic publisher kept constantly before us our ultimate, if
remote, goal. Four years have passed, and after many unavoidable delays
the book is finished. We have not done it all by correspondence. Mrs.
Ayscough has come back to America several times during its preparation;
but, whether together or apart, the plan on which we have worked has
always been the same.
Very early in our studies, we realized that the component parts of the
Chinese written character counted for more in the composition of poetry
than has generally been recognized; that the poet chose one character
rather than another which meant practically the same thing, because of
the descriptive allusion in the make-up of that particular character;
that the poem was enriched precisely through this undercurrent of
meaning in the structure of its characters. But not always--and here was
the difficulty. Usually the character must be taken merely as the word
it had been created to mean. It was a nice distinction, when to allow
one's self the use of these character undercurrents, and when to leave
them out of count entirely. But I would not have my readers suppose that
I have changed or exaggerated the Chinese text. Such has not been the
case. The analysis of characters has been employed very rarely, and only
when the text seemed to lean on the allusion for an added vividness or
zest. In only one case in the book have I permitted myself to use an
adjective not inherent in the character with which I was dealing--and,
in that case, the connotation was in the word itself, being descriptive
of an architectural structure for which we have no equivalent--except in
the "Written Pictures," where, as Mrs. Ayscough has stated in her
Introduction, we allowed ourselves a somewhat freer treatment.
It has been necessary, of course, to acquire some knowledge of the laws
of Chinese versification. But, equally of course, these rules could only
serve to bring me into closer relations with the poems and the technical
limits of the various forms. It was totally impossible to follow either
the rhythms or the rhyme-schemes of the originals. All that could be
done was to let the English words fall into their natural rhythm and not
attempt to handicap the exact word by introducing rhyme at all. This is
the method I followed in my translations of French poems in my book,
"Six French Poets." I hold that it is more important to reproduce the
perfume of a poem than its metrical form, and no translation can
possibly reproduce both.
Our plan of procedure was as follows: Mrs. Ayscough would first write
out the poem in Chinese. Not in the Chinese characters, of course, but
in transliteration. Opposite every word she put the various meanings of
it which accorded with its place in the text, since I could not use a
Chinese dictionary. She also gave the analyses of whatever characters
seemed to her to require it. The lines were carefully indicated, and to
these lines I have, as a rule, strictly adhered; the lines of the
translations usually corresponding, therefore, with the lines of the
originals. In the few poems in which the ordering of the lines has been
changed, this has been done solely in the interest of cadence.
I had, in fact, four different means of approach to a poem. The Chinese
text, for rhyme-scheme and rhythm; the dictionary meanings of the words;
the analyses of characters; and, for the fourth, a careful paraphrase by
Mrs. Ayscough, to which she added copious notes to acquaint me with all
the allusions, historical, mythological, geographical, and technical,
that she deemed it necessary for me to know. Having done what I could
with these materials, I sent the result to her, when she and her Chinese
teacher carefully compared it with the original, and it was returned to
me, either passed or commented upon, as the case might be. Some poems
crossed continent and ocean many times in their course toward
completion; others, more fortunate, satisfied at once. On Mrs.
Ayscough's return to America this year, all the poems were submitted to
a farther meticulous scrutiny, and I can only say that they are as near
the originals as we could make them, and I hope they may give one
quarter of the pleasure to our readers that they have to us in preparing
them.
