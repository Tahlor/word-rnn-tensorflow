DEDICATION,
TO THE HONORABLE
THE LADY ANN COKE.


PRAISE‚Äîwhen it is fairly earned and justly due, is that meed which virtue
delights to bestow upon merit; and, as it is highly gratifying to every
worthy mind to receive, so next to those who merit it, it is to none more
delightful than to those who are allied to, and love and regard the
object of the Eulogy.  Most grateful then must it be to the feelings of a
beloved wife, to hear and even read of the honorable and praise-worthy
actions of a kind and tender husband.  It is indeed like the oil of
gladness to the heart, which, while it softens and lubricates, rejoices
and refines: while it is read it delights‚Äîinspires a desire to
imitate‚Äîinfuses a portion of the spirit it celebrates into the bosom of
rectitude‚Äîand cherishes the noble incentive to ‚Äúgo and do likewise.‚Äù
Under this impression it is, that the Author has presumed to dedicate to
your Ladyship, this humble tribute of his respect and esteem.  If he must
not be allowed to rank it with the brighter effusions of imagination;
yet, being founded in truth, it is intrinsically superior to the flights
of fancy, and he trusts when you consider the justness of the panegyric,
and the sincerity which inspires it; you will look over the imperfection
of the Performance, in regard to the goodness of the intention; and
readily pardon the writers defects of genius in justice to the warmth of
his feelings.

Should this humble attempt tend to circulate more widely the Virtues it
aspires to praise, or induce some more elevated Bard to

             ‚ÄúTouch the sounding strings,
    And in more fervid p≈ìans sing his fame.‚Äù

the Author will be highly gratified and rejoice in the happy effects of
his labours.

                                                 He begs most respectfully
                                                     to subscribe himself,
                                            your Ladyship‚Äôs very obedient,
                                                           humble Servant,
                                                                  _PHILO_.




TO THE READER.


The principal part of the following little Poem (if it deserves so high a
character) was composed ten or a dozen years ago, and is extracted from a
much longer Eulogy upon our Great Patriot, his Holkham, and his
Agriculture; but which, for reasons not necessary to mention here, has
never met the public eye; nor would what is here published, have done so
now, had the Author been aware of any Competitor in the same field, who
had attempted to do justice to the great and good man whose fame he
aspires to sing.  But now the Guardian of our County‚Äôs rights, her
liberties and laws, has resigned his seat in Parliament, and after seeing
the great measures for which he so long contended in the House of Commons
(namely, a Reform in the Representation‚Äîa repeal of the Corporation and
Test Acts‚Äîand the destruction of the rotten Boroughs;) granted to the
energetic exertions of a great People, aided by the support of a
Patriotic Monarch, and a wise Ministry; has retired to the Sylvan shades
of his wide domain, to enjoy the well earned meed of public virtue and
private spirit; the Author could no longer delay presenting this humble
tribute to his fame, and he trusts it will now be deemed neither
misplaced nor ill timed, and although its pretensions are so humble, yet
as they are ardent and sincere, he hopes it will be received with the
candour and indulgence such trifles (while they survive) are usually
received, when the praise is so justly due‚Äîso dearly earned‚Äîand so seldom
deserved; in which case he will be highly gratified and his labour amply
rewarded.

                                                                  _PHILO_.

THE TRIBUTE.


   YES‚ÄîBRITONS BOAST! in these dark times to know
   A man whose Virtue gilds the world below;
   And, like the glory of the Northern star,
   Is known, admired and gazed at from afar;
   Who though he shines so high above his kind,
   Is Polar light to Peasantry and Hind;
   And yet his county, to her lasting shame,
   No Bard has roused to eulogize his name;
   To paint the Virtues in a mortal shrine,
   And point the gem by its refulgent shine.
   So be it mine to touch the sounding string,
   The FRIEND; the PATRIOT; and the MAN to sing.
   O could I reach the famed Apollo‚Äôs lyre;
   I‚Äôd chaunt his praises with a Poets fire;
   But if unequal to such lofty flights,
   My subject warms me, and my task delights;
   And though unused to raise the tuneful song,
   The MIGHTY THEME shall make my numbers strong;
   Bright TRUTH shall guide me, like the solar rays,
   Illume my darkness and direct my praise!
   Inspire each thought, and breathe in ev‚Äôry line,
   And grace my Eulogy with rays divine;
   And, while I paint the scene, the fact recite,
   Still burst upon me in a blaze of light.

   Wake then my MUSE the gen‚Äôrous trump of fame,
   And let her clarion laud the Patriot‚Äôs name;
   Whose glorious actions well deserve the lay,
   In deathless strains his merits to pourtray;
   Who, while he makes his much loved HOLKHAM smile,
   Exalts the glory of our Sea girt Isle.
   What though short lived, my tribute I will bring,
   And add my feather to the Eagle‚Äôs wing;
   Upon his pinions striving, thus to climb,
   Upborne awhile along the stream of time,
   And tho‚Äô my garland may fall off, his plumes
   A grateful Muse her transient song presumes.

   See the great FARMER at his rural seat,
   When cares of state admit of his retreat;
   Within his noble hospitable dome,
   The Prince as well as Peasant finds a home;
   Born for the _world_ and for his race designed,
   His Godlike bounty flows for all mankind;
   Receives the Stranger, as a welcome guest,
   Who while he tarries, feels no wish unbless‚Äôd;
   The Patriot there with gay and cheerful heart,
   Mid‚Äô all his greatness has the happy art,
   To set each timid visitor at ease,
   By courteous manners ever apt to please;
   Where, open as his hand, th‚Äôexpanding door,
   Receives the wealthy where he feeds the poor;
   Where none are seen to sorrow or complain;
   Within the circle of his wide domain,
   Abundance reigns; and comfort sweetly flows;
   And, like the shadow, follows where he goes:
   No discontent is felt when he is nigh,
   And anxious cares before his presence fly;
   The faithful hind rejoicing in his smile,
   With cheerful industry pursues his toil;
   The gen‚Äôrous rustic glories in his sight,
   Who makes his heavy burden weigh more light;
   And feels exalted and rejoiced to find;
   The best of masters of the human kind;
   Proud of his kindred, then he seems to scan,
   His inbred worth, and deems himself a man.

   O if the man who makes a single blade,
   Lift its green head above the parched glade;
   Where never verdure did before appear,
   Deserves the plaudits of the world to hear;
   What shall we say of him whose arts contrive,
   To make whole fields of smiling herbage thrive;
   Who turns the moor, into a fertile vale,
   Where flocks and herds inhale the vernal gale;
   Congeals the sand upon the northern breeze
   And decorates the waste with shrubs and trees:
   Such worth as this should like the sunbeams blaze,
   And sculptur‚Äôd marbles speak to sing his praise;
   Fame raise him pillars in each land and clime,
   And Poets praise him in the song sublime;
   The deathless laurel round his temples twine,
   And his immortal wreath untarnish‚Äôd shine.

                                * * * * *

   On lib‚Äôral terms his Tenants are posses‚Äôd;
   Their contracts made, they feel themselves at rest;
   Their tenures permanent, at easy rents,
   None make a bargain which he e‚Äôer repents;
   But once engaged, he finds his contract please;
   Assured of independence, peace and ease.
   The honor‚Äôd Landlord thus his rights maintains,
   And like a Father o‚Äôer his Children reigns;
   His reign is arbitrary ‚Äôtis confess‚Äôd,
   Because he gains possession of the breast;
   And wins the affections, of the gen‚Äôrous hind,
   By noble dealings and by actions kind;
   Who tho‚Äô he spurns the mean desire of pelf,
   Enriching others meets reward himself.
   Of him ye Landlords learn the only way,
   To make your Acres your high hopes repay;
   And know that only by a lasting lease,
   Your lands ye can improve, your wealth increase;
   See this plain truth, clear as the solar ray,
   In COKE‚ÄôS large rental, swelling ev‚Äôry day;
   Turn but your eyes to HOLKHAM‚ÄôS fertile plain,
   And see it proved in ev‚Äôry joyous swain;
   Behold how riches, in a Patriot‚Äôs hand,
   Diffuse abundance thro‚Äô a steril land;
   And view how wealth, when properly applied,
   Scatters her golden lustre far and wide.
   Within the narrow space of fifty years;
   How Nature‚Äôs rugged face improv‚Äôd appears;
   Where scarce a sheep cot rais‚Äôd its shelt‚Äôring head,
   To screen the Shepherd as his flocks he fed;
   Now graceful mansions glad the Traveller‚Äôs eyes,
   And socialize the hills on which they rise;
   Where here and there a dome of antique taste,
   Made solitude appear amid the waste;
   Now ornamental buildings grace the spot,
   And population cheers the humble cot:
   Where not a briar would rise to deck the heath,
   Nor wild _flower_ bloom to paint a May day wreath;
   Now cooling groves and flowery sweets are seen,
   To form a landscape mid‚Äô the varied scene;
   Within whose sylvan shades we see reside,
   In ease, content, and independent pride;
   The NORFOLK YEOMEN rearing Heroes brave,
   To guard BRITANNIA while she rules the wave;
   Just such a _Peasantry_ in heart and nerve,
   As _England‚Äôs Genius_ glories to preserve.

   Amid the fruitful hills and smiling vales,
   Each grateful Tenant, his loved Landlord hails;
   Whose spacious mansion tow‚Äôring to the skies,
   Central we see majestically rise;
   Around whose bright demesnes, a happy race
   Of wealthy Farmers share the fertile space;
   And while they feel his favours grateful glow,
   Though from his streams their smaller streamlets flow;
   In chrystal currents, gliding pure and clear,
   Through all the country round the swains to cheer.
   Though his bright beams, just like the orb of day,
   The lesser stars eclipses with his ray;
   It warms, illumes, and gladdens as it shines,
   Each minor Planet which around him twines
   While as they circle near their central sun,
   Illumin‚Äôd by his light their course they run;
   Fed from his flame they own his golden rays,
   And glisten round him in a silver blaze.

   When Heavens indulgence joineth earth to skies,
   In nice gradations does the chain arise;
   From beast to man, from man the links extend,
   Angels to Seraphs rise, and these ascend,
   In shining orders, unto us unknown,
   All stretching forward to the Empyrean throne;
   Yet never destined, in their loftiest flight,
   To reach the glorious source of life and light.
   Thus if mens acts with Heavens we may compare,
   NORFOLK‚ÄôS GREAT COMMONER his fame would rear;
   Lifting the poor Plebeian from the dust,
   The chain extending to a place of trust;
   The trusty Servant to a Bailiff springs;
   The Bailiff sinks, a cheerful Farmer sings;
   The Farmer grows in wealth, wealth has no worth,
   Until dispers‚Äôd among the sons of earth;
   His Children rise with wealth, they learning gain,
   And knowledge still extends the golden chain;
   Wisdom in Virtue ends, and thus he tries
   To raise a lowly Peasant to the skies;
   Thus imitating Heaven while here below,
   Endeavouring so his image fair to show,
   In pristine beauty, bursting from the clay,
   As from his makers hand, he sprung to day.

                                * * * * *

   Could such a man then in the _shades_ remain,
   To cheer the heart and bless the labouring swain?
   No, worth like his, which Greece or Rome might praise!
   Wisdom denied this solace of his days;
   And call‚Äôd him forth, to glad the noble band,
   Of faithful champions for their native land;
   To BRITAINS SENATE _Virtue_ called her son,
   And LIBERTY reviving hail‚Äôd her own.
   Just at the crisis of that wasteful war,
   Which misled Albion proclaim‚Äôd afar,
   Across the Atlantic wave, where Slaughter stood,
   And dyed the British hand with British blood;
   Then as the County‚Äôs Genius look‚Äôd around,
   To where her worthiest offspring might be found;
   Soon HOLKHAM‚ÄôS glitt‚Äôring turrets she discerned,
   Where in her COKE the heart of CATO burned;
   There like the good _Cincennatus_ at plough,
   In olden times, she ‚Äôspied her Patriot now;
   And call‚Äôd him thence, to help the ship of state,
   Where frightful rocks, were frowning big with fate;
   To guide her safely o‚Äôer the threat‚Äôning shoal,
   And keep her freightage safe, her timbers whole.
   Then love of Country fired his youthful breast;
   He flew to save her tho‚Äô by foes oppress‚Äôd;
   The COUNTY roused sustained his cheering voice,
   And FIFTY SUMMERS have approv‚Äôd her choice.
   Placed in the Senate there he joined the few;
   Still faithful found among a faithless crew;
   Their strength augmenting by his Patriot name,
   Which flew before, the Herald of his fame;
   Their numbers few in intellect were strong,
   For PITT and BURKE were in the minor throng;
   There had they kept, had Virtue ruled their hearts,
   But pride prevailing tinged their shining parts.

                                * * * * *

   Alas! how few are proof against the wiles,
   Of artful Courtiers, fascinating smiles;
   Allured by place ambitiously they rise,
   And spurn the People and their rights despise;
   With hearts ungrateful treating them as foes,
   Though the first patrons on whose wings they rose;
   But COKE, too good the Virtues to disgrace,
   By bartering honour for the sake of place,
   Firm to his trust and to the Country true,
   The path of justice anxious to pursue;
   With ERSKINE, FOX, and ROMILLY the great,
   His glory placing in his Country‚Äôs fate;
   Resolved the leaky Vessel, still to trim;
   Or, with the stately Bark, to sink or swim.
   What though they could not her distress prevent,
   They ne‚Äôer to cause it have their suffrage lent;
   And when they saw the ruin we deplore,
   Still strove to save and VIRTUE could no more;
   But though they could not stem corruption‚Äôs tide,
   They ne‚Äôer upon its golden waves would ride;
   And as they fail‚Äôd to purify its source,
   Still used their efforts to obstruct its course:
   Could place or pension, COKE‚ÄôS support obtain,
   He had not sought these tempting lures in vain;
   Could titled honours lure his soul astray,
   To join Corruption, and his trust betray;
   These borrowed glories would on him have shone,
   Though not with half the brilliance of his own;
   Still all unsullied he preserved his soul,
   No bribe could tempt him, nor no power control;
   But, like the sailor, faithful to the last,
   He nail‚Äôd his colours to his country‚Äôs mast.

                                * * * * *

   When war, taxation, and distress unite
   To rouse the COUNTRY and her ire excite;
   And a wrong‚Äôd People, while their burthens press
   Call‚Äôd on the Crown for succour and redress;
   The minions who prevailed the sword to draw,
   For their own safety would _suspend_ the law; {16}
   And those who dared the People‚Äôs voice to slight,
   Resolved to rob them of their dearest right;
   Then did our Patriot pure, resist the act,
   With wisdom‚Äôs _worthiest weapon_ REASON back‚Äôd;
   But all in vain our liberties we mourn,
   On false pretences from the Country torn;
   Yet still he hoped to see the rising day,
   When England‚Äôs glory, bursting with its ray;
   Should shine again, with pristine splendour graced,
   Each blot destroyed, and every stain effaced:
   Her Sun still burning with fresh glory bright,
   And, with her Heavenly beams of warmth and light,
   Illume the world, and teach mankind to know;
   That VIRTUE, WISDOM, ARTS and SCIENCE grow,
   Only where FREEDOM reigns, around whose throne,
   These Intellectual gems have ever shone;
   For LIBERTY it is, whose beams divine,
   Inspire the Sages thought, the Poet‚Äôs line,
   Excite bright genius, spread its golden flame,
   And fill a realm with glory, wealth, and fame.

                                * * * * *

   So could Corruption‚Äôs phalanx rest composed,
   While this GREAT COMMONER their acts opposed;
   And not attempt to lure him to their side,
   By every means which patronage supplied;
   The tempting PLACE, the luring TITLE shone,
   To make the Patriot his friends disown;
   But when they found their efforts all in vain,
   The good man to ensnare, his honour stain;
   Their Pride was roused, they swell‚Äôd with angry heat,
   And lent their aid to push him from his seat;
   But here again defeated and despised,
   They only saw how greatly he was prized;
   Who like a mighty rock in ocean cast,
   Smiled at the whirlwind, and defied the blast.

                                * * * * *

   Let others boast, the titles _Kings_ create;
   The flaming riband, or proud coronet;
   Honors which wear their glories for a day,
   Oft blushing wear, and swiftly fade away:
   COKE‚ÄôS glory found a more substantial base,
   Which future Patriots shall delight to trace;
   And while the faithful Portrait they pourtray,
   See Norfolk‚Äôs Patriot live in every trait.

                                * * * * *

   For fifty years spent in politic life,
   When war and rapine gender‚Äôd heat and strife;
   No venal act of his appears to wound,
   His virtuous soul, or hurt his conscience sound;
   No VOTE of his through all that long career,
   Has caused the widows sigh, the orphans tear;
   Nor from the Peasant‚Äôs industry withdrawn
   Those heavy taxes grieveous to be borne;
   Curtail‚Äôd his Country‚Äôs rights, the laws denied,
   Unto the injured, by oppression tried;
   Indemnified the man who did him wrong,
   Or made the Oligarchal Tyrants strong;
   Nor when the times perplexed a starving poor,
   Who sue for pity and for aid implore;
   Their sad petitions in such deep distress,
   Denied the means of urging for redress;
   To their bewailings gave the name of riot,
   And crushed their rights, to keep the injured quiet.
   Then if the Virtues which adorn his name,
   Did not quite fill the trumpet of his fame;
   ‚ÄôTwould make no faint addition to the sound,
   To tell the acts where he could not be found,
   To lend his name, his voice, his vote to raise,
   And cloud the Sun of England‚Äôs better days;
   And that which courtiers boastfully have done,
   Should be his glory to have left undone.

                                 * * * *

   Born for the good of all, his bosom glows,
   With softest sympathy in all its‚Äô throws;
   No narrow feeling e‚Äôer restrains his grace,
   Whose heart expansive takes in all his race;
   No sect or party, rank or state we find,
   Contract the bounty of his gen‚Äôrous mind;
   To human wretchedness his list‚Äôning ear,
   Is ever open, and his heart sincere
   In gen‚Äôrous bounty, wafts the swift relief,
   To whom stern mis‚Äôry overloads with grief;
   And if he can‚Äôt restore the broken heart,
   His sympathizing bosom bears a part:
   Thus sensibility his heart to bless,
   In sweet o‚Äôerflowings shews its fine impress;
   And he who can this balmy balsam share,
   The better graces nurtures plump and fair:
   It is the soil in which the Virtues grow,
   To gild the fields, and paint the vales below;
   Sow but the seeds, the germs will quickly shoot,
   And grow luxuriant from the fruitful root;
   Mature through life, and when the Angels reap,
   The ripened harvest, in bright worlds will keep;
   For sympathizing feelings warm the breast,
   Of heavenly spirits and delight the blest;
   And when sweet sympathies the bosom move,
   We most resemble Heaven, for Heaven is love.

                                * * * * *

   But cease fond Muse nor longer strive to paint,
   His bright perfections with thy pencil faint;
   Nor more attempt that conduct to relate,
   Which guides the Patriot in a sinking state;
   When ev‚Äôry action of his life is lent,
   To guard his COUNTRY, or to serve her meant;
   Could we retrace the fifty years gone by‚Äî
   But who can look at them without a sigh;
   What act designed our freedom to defend,
   Did not his influence and his vote befriend;
   What meant to ease the burdens of the land,
   Did not his instant patronage command;
   The PRESS‚Äô LIBERTY, the JURY‚ÄôS right,
   Supporting still, with reasons clearest light,
   Sweet PEACE, to keep or to restore her reign,
   He deemed no effort lost, no labour vain;
   For well he knew protected by her smile,
   ARTS, COMMERCE, SCIENCE, _flourish_ in our Isle.
   When looking back a century or more,
   With anxious heart our errors to explore;
   The faults he sees desirous to amend,
   The People‚Äôs glory and his Country‚Äôs friend;
   Sought every means which wisdom can suggest,
   To keep the fre‚Äôest system still the best;
   By rectifying ev‚Äôry known abuse,
   Which gliding time is apt to introduce,
   In the best schemes devised by human skill,
   And thus preserve its pristine vigour still,
   Has ever been his object, hope and aim,
   And from this PUBLIC VIRTUE springs his fame:
   And yet no visionary schemer he,
   Would ne‚Äôer advance beyond what he could see
   His wish to mend, but fearful of mistake,
   He never wish‚Äôd to change for changing sake;
   But what experience shows the times require,
   Limit his wish and bound his whole desire;
   E‚Äôen these to gain by gentle means he tries,
   By mild expedients, and by measures wise;
   Not anxious grasping to get all he sees,
   At one rude effort, but by slow degrees;
   Nor would he e‚Äôer despise what power would grant,
   Because he knows it is not all we want;
   But takes with joy the good he can obtain,
   And hopes in time the residue to gain;
   This hope at length the grateful Patriot saw,
   Half gratified‚Äîby JUSTICE, TRUTH, and LAW;
   And though he trembled at the threatened storm,
   The tempest saw repelled by MILD REFORM;
   And what for fifty years he sought in vain,
   Lives to behold in a FOURTH WILLIAM‚ÄôS reign;
   And a NEW CHARTER, destined to endure,
   Renders our Rights and Liberties secure:
   Then, all his work complete, his duty o‚Äôer,
   He quits his public toils, resolved no more,
   To represent the County, or her weal;
   But trust her safety to more youthful zeal;
   And with a conduct every where admired,
   Resigned his seat and cheerfully retired;
   Grateful to find that _friends_ and _foes_ now own,
   That HE to ENGLAND has HIS DUTY DONE.
   Still like the glorious orb which gilds the day,
   He warms, delights, and blesses with his ray;
   Yet silent spreads his bounty as he goes,
   Observed but by the favors he bestows.

                                * * * * *

   Hail! to the man who greatly spends his days,
   In deeds of glory ‚Äôbove the Muse‚Äôs praise;
   With grateful raptures may his heart still glow,
   And healthy roses in his face still blow;
   Yet may he long survive, ALL Norfolk‚Äôs pride,
   And ‚ÄôMID THE PEERAGE o‚Äôer her weal preside;
   This is his due, and should _be_ his reward,
   Although he does not much the boon regard;
   ‚ÄôTis only just his Patriot brows should wear,
   The dazzling coronet which decks a Peer;
   For though the bauble he may wisely slight,
   It sometimes dignifies, and wears so bright:
   The man it _graces_, and exalts so high,
   Among the glitt‚Äôring stars which gild the sky;
   That those who wear it as it was designed,
   Are raised to Gods among the humbler kind:
   Still some will think who most his merits scan,
   He‚Äôd better live and die the PEOPLES‚Äô MAN;
   And still be called, acknowledged, and believed,
   _The greatest Commoner who ever lived_;
   And that which won the plaudits of the wise,
   Through life; remain his glory when he dies.
   O may his vigorous frame feel no decay,
   But heat receding gently wear away;
   His hopes still _bright‚Äôning_ as he views the tomb,
   While _Virtue‚Äôs_ beams, his closing scene illume;
   And, like the day star in the rubied west,
   Shine FULLER, LOVELIER, as he sinks to rest.
   When rising ‚Äômong the spheres his spirit soars,
   As highest Heaven‚Äôs Empyrean he explores;
   Glides ‚Äômid the stars, surveys the milky way,
   Exulting in the bright celestial day;
   Then may _indulgent_ Heaven delight his shade,
   With aided ken, the curtain to pervade;
   Which hides the realms ethereal from our sight,
   And that bright region clouds with shades of night;
   So from his glory in yon azure sky,
   He still his earthly Paradise shall ‚Äôspy;
   There see his Heirs adorn the name of COKE,
   And all the COUNTY _still to_ HOLKHAM _look_:
   Behold a race of Patriots from him rise,
   In training there, to meet him in the skies:
   Still join unseen among her festive guests;
   And feel the rapture which delights their breasts:
   Enjoy THIS PARADISE, or _Heaven_ at _will_,
   The GUARDIAN GENIUS of his HOLKHAM STILL.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
