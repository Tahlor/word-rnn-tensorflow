[Transcriber's note:

This e-text uses a number of characters that depend on utf-8 encoding,
particularly small and capital yogh (»ù, »ú), small and capital thorn (√æ,
√û), double l with a tilde through (lÃ¥lÃ¥), u with a macron (≈´), h with a
line through the top (ƒß), r with a upwards hook attached to the
horizontal stem (rÃõ) and ae ligature with an acute accent («Ω). If they
do not display properly, you may refer to transliterated (Latin-1)
version of this text.

This e-text also uses some characters that are not in unicode. I have
rendered them following:

{m~} for a m with a loop back over the character.
{n)} for a n with a ) attached to the right side.
{d+} for the d with a little crook attached to the top right of the d.

There is also one instance of (on line 391 of the poem) a m with a )
attached to the right side (rendered as {m)}), but this is probably a
typo for {m~}. I have left this as is.

Text and letters in brackets [ ] is original.

Obvious typos are corrected in this e-text.]

PREFACE.


Good wine needs no bush, and this tale needs no Preface. I shall not
tell the story of it--let readers go to the verse itself for that; nor
shall I repeat to those who begin it the exhortation of the englisher of
_Sir Generides_,

      "for goddes sake, or ye hens wende,
    Here this tale unto the ende."--(ll. 3769-70.)

If any one having taken it up is absurd enough to lay it down without
finishing it, let him lose the fun, and let all true men pity him.
Though the state of morals disclosed by the story is not altogether
satisfactory, yet it is a decided improvement on that existing in Roberd
of Brunne's time in 1303, for he had to complain of the lords of his
day:

    Also do √æese lordynges,
    √ûe[y] trespas moche yn twey √æynges;
    √ûey rauys a mayden a»ùens here wyl,
    And mennys wyuys √æey lede awey √æertyl.
    A grete vylanye √æarte he dous
    »úyf he make therof hys rouse [boste]:
    √ûe dede ys confusyun,
    And more ys √æe dyffamacyun.

The volume containing the poem was shown to me by Mr Stubbs, the
Librarian at Lambeth, in order that I might see the version of Sir
Gyngelayne, son of Sir Gawain, which Mr Morris is some day, I trust, to
edit for the Society in one of his Gawain volumes.[1] Finding the
present poem also on the paper leaves, I copied it out the same
afternoon, and here it is for a half-hour's amusement to any reader who
chooses to take it up.

The handwriting of the MS. must be of a date soon after 1460, and this
agrees well with the allusion to Edward the Fourth's accession, and the
triumph of the White Rose o'er the Red alluded to in the last lines of
the poem. The Garlond,

    It was made ...
    Of flourys most of honoure,
    Of roses whyte √æat wylÃ¥lÃ¥ nott fade,
    Whych floure alÃ¥lÃ¥ ynglond doth glade....
    Vn-to the whych floure I-wys
    The loue of God and of the comonys
    Subdued bene of ryght.

For, that the Commons of England were glad of their Yorkist king, and
loved Duke Richard's son, let Holinshed's record prove. He testifies:

     "Wherevpon it was againe demanded of the commons, if they would
     admit and take the said erle as their prince and souereigne lord;
     which all with one voice cried: Yea, yea....

     "Out of the ded stocke sprang a branch more mightie than the stem;
     this Edward the Fourth, a prince so highlie fauoured of the peple,
     for his great liberalite, clemencie, vpright dealing, and courage,
     that aboue all other, he with them stood in grace alone: by reason
     whereof, men of all ages and degrees to him dailie repaired, some
     offering themselues and their men to ioepard their liues with him,
     and other plentiouslie gaue monie to support his charges, and to
     mainteine his right."

Would that we knew as much of Adam of Cobsam as of our White-Rose king.
He must have been one of the Chaucer breed,[2] but more than this poem
tells of him I cannot learn.

P.S.--There are other Poems about Edward IV. in the volume, which will
be printed separately.[3] One on Women is given at the end of the
present text.

PP.S. 1869.--Mr C.H. Pearson, the historian of the Early and Middle Ages
of England, has supplied me with the immediate original of this story.
He says:

     "The Wright's Chaste Wife is a reproduction of one of the _Gesta
     Romanorum_, cap. 69, de Castitate, ed. Keller. The Latin story
     begins 'Gallus regnavit prudens valde.' The Carpenter gets a shirt
     with his wife, which is never to want washing unless one of them is
     unfaithful. The lovers are three Knights (_milites_), and they are
     merely kept on bread and water, not made to work; nor is any wife
     introduced to see her lord's discomfiture. The English version,
     therefore, is much quainter and fuller of incident than its
     original. But the 'morality' of the Latin story is rich beyond
     description. 'The wife is holy Mother Church,' 'the Carpenter is
     the good Christian,' 'the shirt is our Faith, because, as the
     apostle says, it is impossible to please God without faith.' The
     Wright's work typifies 'the building up the pure heart by the works
     of mercy.' The three Knights are 'the pride of life, the lust of
     the eyes, and the lust of the flesh.' 'These you must shut up in
     the chamber of penance till you get an eternal reward from the
     eternal King.' 'Let us therefore pray God,' &c."

With the Wright's Chaste Wife may also be compared the stories mentioned
in the Notes, p. 20, and the Ballad "The Fryer well fitted; or

    A Pretty jest that once befel,
    How a maid put a Fryer to cool in the well"

printed "in the Bagford Collection; in the Roxburghe (ii. 172); the
Pepys (iii. 145); the Douce (p. 85); and in _Wit and Mirth, an Antidote
to Melancholy_, 8vo. 1682; also, in an altered form, in Pills to purge
Melancholy, 1707, i. 340; or 1719, iii. 325"; and the tune of which,
with an abstract of the story, is given in Chappell's _Popular Music_,
i. 273-5. The Friar makes love to the Maid; she refuses him for fear of
hell-fire.

    Tush, quoth the Friar, thou needst not doubt;
    If thou wert in Hell, I could sing thee out.

So she consents if he'll bring her an angel of money. He goes home to
fetch it, and she covers the well over with a cloth. When he comes back,
and has given her the money, she pretends that her father is coming,
tells the Friar to run behind the cloth, and down he flops into the
well. She won't help him at first, because if he could sing her out of
hell, he can clearly sing himself out of the well: but at last she does
help him out, keeps his money because he's dirtied the water, and sends
him home dripping along the street like a new-washed sheep.

[Footnote 1: The since printing of the Romance in the Percy Folio MS.
Ballads and Romances, (_Lybius Disconius_, ii. 404,) will probably
render this unnecessary. (1869.)]

[Footnote 2: Chaucer brings off his Carpenter, though, triumphant, and
not with the swived wife and broken arm that he gives his befooled
Oxford craftsman in _The Milleres Tale_. (1869.)]

1867.]

                    [_MS. Lambeth 306, leaves 178-187._]

NOTES.


The two first of the three operations of flax-dressing described in
lines 526-529, p. 15,

    One of hem knocked lyne,
    A-nothyr swyngelyd good and fyne
      By-fore the swyngylÃ¥lÃ¥-tre,
    The thyrde did rele and spynne,

must correspond to the preliminary breaking of the plant, and then the
scutching or beating to separate the coarse tow or hards from the tare
or fine hemp. Except so far as the _swingle_ served as a heckle, the
further _heckling_ of the flax, to render the fibre finer and cleaner,
was dispensed with, though heckles (iron combs) must have been in use
when the poem was written--inasmuch as _hekele_, _hekelare_, _hekelyn_,
and _hekelynge_, are in the Promptorium, ab. 1440 A.D. Under _Hatchell_,
Randle Holme gives a drawing of a heckle.

The lines through the _h_'s in the MS. are not, I believe, marks of
contraction. There are no insettings of the third lines, or spaces on
changes of subject, in the MS.

For reference to two analogous stories to that of the Poem, I am
indebted to Mr Thomas Wright. The first is that of _Constant Duhamel_ in
the third volume of Barbazan, and the second that of the Prioress and
her three Suitors in the Minor Poems of Dan John Lydgate, published by
the Percy Society, ed. Halliwell.

In the Barbazan tale "the wife is violently solicited by three suitors,
the priest, the provost, and the forester, who on her refusal persecute
her husband. To stop their attacks she gives them appointments at her
house immediately after one another, so that when one is there and
stripped for the bath, another comes, and, pretending it is her husband,
she conceals them one after another in a large tub full of feathers, out
of which they can see all that is going on in the room. She then sends
successively for their three wives to come and bathe with her, the bath
being still in the same room, and as each is stripped naked in the bath,
she introduces her own husband, who dishonours them one after another,
one _√† l'enverse_, with rather aggravating circumstances, and all in
view of their three husbands. Finally the latter are turned out of the
house naked, or rather well feathered, then hunted by the whole town and
their dogs, well bitten and beaten."

(If any one wants to see a justification of the former half of the
proverb quoted by Roberd of Brunne,

    Frenche men synne yn lecherye
    And Englys men yn enuye,

let him read the astounding revelation made of the state of the early
French mind by the tales in the 3rd and 4th vols. of Barbazan's
Fabliaux, ed. 1808.)

The second story, told by Lydgate, is as follows:--A prioress is wooed
by "a yonng knyght, a parson of a paryche, and a burges of a borrow."
She promises herself to the first if he will lie for a night in a chapel
sewn up in a sheet like a corpse; to the second, if he will perform the
funeral service over the knight, and bury him; to the third, if he will
dress up like a devil, and frighten both parson and knight. This the
burges Sir John does well, but is himself terrified at the corpse
getting up: all three run away from one another: the knight falls on a
stake, and into a snare set for bucks, and breaks his fore top in
falling from the tree; the merchant gets tossed by a bull; the parson
breaks his head and jumps into a bramble bush; and the prioress gets rid
of them all, but not before she has made the "burges" or "marchaunt" pay
her twenty marks not to tell his wife and the country generally of his
tricks.--_Minor Poems_, p. 107-117, ed. 1840.

    cannot find that Edward IV. had any such plants on his arms or
    badge. Knots were often worn as badges, see Edmonston's Heraldry,
    Appendix, Knots. On the other hand, Willement (Regal Heraldry)
    notices that the angels attending Richard II. in the picture at
    Wilton, had collars worked with white roses and broom-buds; and
    trueloves, if a plant be meant by it, may have been Edward's
    substitute for the broom (_planta genisla_). The Trewloves bear,

P.S.--This Poem was printed by Mr Halliwell in _Reliqui√¶ Antiqu√¶_, vol.
i., p. 248, and reprinted by Mr Thomas Wright, at p. 103 of his edition
of _Songs and Carols_ for the Percy Society, 1847. As, besides minor
differences, the reprint has _manne_, and the original _nanne_, for what
I read as _nonne_, l. 3, while both have _withowte_ for _with oure_, l.
15, and _accripe_ for _a ttripe_, l. 21 (see Halliwell's Dictionary,
"_accripe_, a herb?"), I have not cancelled this impression. The other
version of the song, from Mr Wright's MS. in his text, pp. 89-91,
differs a good deal from that given above.

[Footnote 1: The Rev. J.R. Lumby first told me of the proverb 'As white
as a nun's hen,' the nuns being famous, no doubt, for delicate poultry.
John Heywood has in his _Proverbes_, 1562 (first printed, 1546), p. 43
of the Spencer Society's reprint, 1867,

    She tooke thenterteinment of the yong men
    All in daliaunce, _as nice as a Nun's hen_.

The proverb is quoted by Wilson in his _Arte of Rhetorique_, 1553
(Hazlitt's _Proverbs_, p. 69).]
