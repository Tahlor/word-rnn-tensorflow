LITTLE ENGEL.


It was the little Engel, he
   So handsome was and gay;
To Upland rode he on a tide
   And bore a maid away.

In ill hour he to Upland rode
   And made a maid his prize;
The first night they together lay
   Was down by Vesteryse.

It was the little Engel he
   Awoke at black midnight,
And straight begins his dream to state
   In terror and affright.

‚ÄúMethought the wolf-whelp and his dam,
   The laidly she-wolf gray,
Tore out my heart, and twixt their teeth
   Did hold it as I lay.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat thou dream‚Äôst little Engel thus
   Can cause slight wonderment,
When me thou‚Äôst ta‚Äôen by might and main
   Nor asked my friends‚Äô consent.‚Äù

In came Solwey Johnsen then
   And stood before the table;
He was I ween, a clever lad,
   And well to speak was able.

‚ÄúHear thou, my lord, Little Engel,
   Rise up and straight begone;
For here Sir Godey Loumand comes
   By four ways to the town.‚Äù

‚ÄúI fear not four, Solwey Johnsen,
   Nor five fear I, nor ten!
I fear not Godey Sir Loumand, though
   He come with thirty men.‚Äù

‚ÄúO there are more than four, Sir,
   Or five, Sir, or than ten;
Here cometh Godey Sir Loumand with
   A hundred armed men.‚Äù

It was the little Engel, he
   Took Malfred in his arm:
‚ÄúNow, dearest heart, some counsel give
   May free us from this harm.‚Äù

It was the little Engel, her
   Upon the white cheek kiss‚Äôd:
‚ÄúNow do thou hear, my bosom‚Äôs dear,
   With counsel us assist.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe best advice that I can give
   I‚Äôll give thee in this case;
To Mary‚Äôs Church we will retire,
   They‚Äôll ne‚Äôer destroy that place.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll gold and silver take, and on
   The scale we‚Äôll pile them high;
To-morrow from the Churchmen we
   The holy place will buy.

‚ÄúAround you call your merry men all
   To whom you‚Äôve given bread;
For refuge we to the Kirk will flee
   Since we are thus bestead.

‚ÄúDo you take all your merry men who
   Your coursers‚Äô backs have prest;
We‚Äôll hie us to our Lady‚Äôs church,
   And set our hearts at rest.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the best counsel, love, I know,
   A simple woman I;
In Mary‚Äôs house we‚Äôll lock ourselves,
   And there our foes defy.‚Äù

It was the little Engel,
   Into the church he went:
Sir Loumand to beleaguer him
   A hundred men has sent.

Before the kirk his men they lay
   Till full five months were past;
It was Godey Sir Loumand
   So wrathful grew at last.

Then spake the mother of little Malfred,
   With hate ‚Äôgainst her was fill‚Äôd:
‚ÄúThe Kirk of Maria burn with fire,
   And it with gold rebuild.‚Äù

The fire began to burn, to burn,
   The sparkles in they flew;
At that adread was little Malfred,
   And ashy pale she grew.

It was so hot in the Kirk yard when
   Abroad the blazes sped;
But in the Kirk still hotter when
   In poured the melted lead.

It was the little Malfred,
   So frantic was her mood:
‚ÄúO let us quick the horses stick,
   And cool us with their blood.‚Äù

Then little Engel answer made,
   As on the floor he stood:
‚ÄúBut coolness small shall we derive
   From our good coursers‚Äô blood.‚Äù

Answered the groom who loved the steeds
   As dearly as his breath:
‚ÄúYe‚Äôd better little Malfred stick,
   She well deserveth death.‚Äù

It was the little Engel,
   His arms round Malfred twin‚Äôd:
‚ÄúNo death hast thou deserved from us,
   And none from us shalt find.

‚ÄúMy little Malfred, do thou hear
   What I now say to thee;
If a son this year thou chance to bear,
   That son name after me.‚Äù

They placed her on a buckler,
   They placed their spears below,
And through the window lifted her
   With hearts so full of woe.

It was the little Malfred round
   The church goes staggering now,
Scorched were her scarlet robes, and scorched
   The ringlets on her brow.

It was the little Malfred fell
   Upon her white bare knee:
‚ÄúO may I bear a son this year,
   The avenger of this to be.‚Äù

So they the little Malfred took
   And in a mantle roll‚Äôd,
And sorrowfully lifted her
   Upon a courser bold.

Outspake the little Malfred when
   She reached the verdant plain:
‚ÄúBurnt is our Lady‚Äôs house this day,
   And burnt so bold a swain.

‚ÄúBurnt is our Lady‚Äôs house, and burnt
   Therein so brave a swain;
His equal till the day of doom
   We ne‚Äôer shall see again.‚Äù

It happened in the autumn tide,
   The autumn of that year,
That she within her secret bower,
   A beauteous boy did bear.

To the holy Kirk they carried him,
   They christened him at night;
They called him little Engel, and
   Concealed him whilst they might.

They fostered him for winter one,
   And so on, till he grew
The fairest knight beneath the sun
   That you did ever view.

So well he grew and throve until
   Seven years had passed away:
‚ÄúThy uncle slew thy sire, my boy,
   For the first time, that I say.‚Äù

Still with his mother he remained
   Till five more years were sped:
‚ÄúThy uncle slew thy father, boy,‚Äù
   He heard most often said.

‚ÄúNow do thou hear, my mother dear,
   Who sittest clad in pall;
Up under Oe I‚Äôll riding go,
   And serve in the Monarch‚Äôs hall.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, ride thee hence to Court, and there
   To win thee honor try;
Forget not who thy father slew,
   For the last time I cry.‚Äù

He served so long at court that he
   His friend the Dane King made;
With heavy heart he‚Äôd sit apart
   Whilst others laugh‚Äôd and play‚Äôd.

The Danish King observed at last
   He grieved at seasons all:
‚ÄúNow hear, good youth, I‚Äôd know forsooth
   Why thou art sorrow‚Äôs thrall.

‚ÄúThou grievest like the little bird
   The greenwood bough upon;
Thou seemest like the lonely wight
   Whose friends are dead and gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow do thou hear, thou King of the Danes,
   With grief I down am weigh‚Äôd;
My uncle slew my sire of old,
   And no atonement made.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf thou wilt up of the country ride,
   And well avenge that deed,
As many of my men to thee
   I‚Äôll lend, as thou shalt need.

‚ÄúIf thou‚Äôlt avenge thy father‚Äôs death,
   Thou shalt have fitting aid;
Three hundred of my men to thee
   I‚Äôll lend, in steel array‚Äôd.‚Äù

It was the little Engel, he
   Rides in the greenwood shade;
He marshals there his good men all,
   And sets him at their head.

In haste came in the little footboy,
   And stood before the table;
He was I ween a clever lad,
   And well to speak was able.

‚ÄúNow hear, Sir Godey Loumand, hear,
   Arise and straight begone;
Little Engel‚Äôs coming with his troop
   By four ways to the town.

‚ÄúLittle Engel‚Äôs coming with his troop,
   And he‚Äôll be on us soon;
And wroth is he, as wroth can be,
   His war-lance scrapes the moon.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt Stevn and Ting, my boy, I‚Äôve been,
   And wherever people mingle;
But ne‚Äôer, I swear, have I been where
   I‚Äôve heard of little Engel.‚Äù

It was Godey Sir Loumand,
   He stroked the page‚Äôs cheek;
‚ÄúIf thou canst give any good advice,
   My pretty footboy, speak.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I can give any good advice
   Most certainly I will;
In your stone bower yourself immure
   From the approaching ill.

‚ÄúThe walls they are of marble stone,
   The doors they are of lead;
‚ÄôTwill wondrous be, my lord, if we
   Therein are prisoners made.‚Äù

It was the little Engel, he
   Halted a while to gaze:
‚ÄúO there doth lie the Kirk, where died
   My sire in smoke and blaze.

‚ÄúAnd there doth stand the castle, where
   My uncle doth reside;
The amends that he shall pay this day
   The Lord in heaven decide.‚Äù

By four ways they the bower beset,
   And for admission call:
The little Engel, sprightly elf,
   Was foremost of them all.

It was Godey Sir Loumand, through
   The casement out looked he:
‚ÄúNow hark, ye knaves, bid your captain tell
   Why ye bawl so furiously?‚Äù

Then answered little Engel straight
   Beneath his mantle ruddy:
‚ÄúEngel he‚Äôs stiled, your sister‚Äôs child,
   And I am he, Sir Godey.‚Äù

Then answered Godey Sir Loumand, he
   Was surely wroth thereat:
‚ÄúRide hence, and boast not of thy birth,
   Thou art a bastard brat.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd though a bastard brat I be,
   My fortune‚Äôs not the worse;
Enough I hold of silver and gold,
   And ride on a gallant horse.

‚ÄúAnd if a bastard brat I be,
   Thou mad‚Äôst me that I trow;
But still I‚Äôve towers, and pleasant bowers,
   And of green woods enow.

‚ÄúMy sire thou slew‚Äôst, and no amends
   To me didst ever make;
Now scoff thou hast upon me cast,
   For which thy life I‚Äôll take.

‚ÄúBring gold, my merry men, and that
   Before the threshold lay;
We‚Äôll burn the bower this very hour,
   We well for it can pay.‚Äù

‚ÄôTwas hot within the foreroom when
   The fire began to roar;
But hotter in the stone bower, when
   The lead began to pour.

It was the little Engel, he
   His courser never turned
To ride away from the castelaye
   Before the bower was burned.

Away at last he rode, and waved
   His hand in exultation,
Upon espying his uncle lying
   Amidst the conflagration.

Said little Engel, when he saw
   His uncle‚Äôs body shrink:
‚ÄúNow thou hast quaffed the self same draught
   Thou mad‚Äôst my father drink.‚Äù

It was the little Engel, rode
   Home to his mother‚Äôs hall;
Before it stood his mother good,
   So fair arrayed in pall.

‚ÄúHere dost thou stand, my mother dear,
   Arrayed in robes of pall;
I‚Äôve ridden up the land, and well
   Avenged my father‚Äôs fall.‚Äù

It was the fair Dame Malfred, wrung
   Her hands and wept amain:
‚ÄúI‚Äôd but one care before to bear,
   And now, alas, have twain!‚Äù

‚ÄúDear mother, thou wouldst have it so,
   Now thee in tears I find,
When duteously thy will I‚Äôve done:
   How strange is woman‚Äôs mind!‚Äù

He turned his steed and rode away,
   His face with anger red;
With dishevelled hair, the Dame stood there,
   Such woeful tears she shed.

The little Engel hied him to
   The King his master‚Äôs court;
Abroad the Dane King stood, and hailed
   The youth in kindest sort.

Into the hall Sir Engel then
   With the good monarch went:
‚ÄúMy choicest thanks, thou noble King,
   For thy brave warriors lent.

‚ÄúNow I‚Äôve avenged my father‚Äôs death,
   Burnt is Sir Godey‚Äôs bower;
And he therein has found a tomb,
   Who slew my sire of yore.‚Äù




AN ELEGY.


Where shall I rest my hapless head,
   Heavy with grief? how plenteously
Must I the briny torrents shed‚Äî
   _Alack and woe is me_!

Our chief is gone, at last, at last,
   The safeguard of our nation he;
The glory of our age is past‚Äî
   _Alack and woe is me_!

Unto the swords, O father dear,
   Of foemen thirsting horribly
For blood, why leave thy children here?
   _Alack and woe is me_!

Of justice is the fountain dried,
   And mute the law‚Äôs high symphony;
Fallen is Europa‚Äôs brightest pride‚Äî
   _Alack and woe is me_.

There is a change of times and things
   That passeth on eternally.
Decreed by Him, the King of Kings‚Äî
   _‚ÄôTis right_‚Äî_but woe is me_!

Now is the earth with violets gay,
   And flowers manifold to see;
Now frozen ‚Äôneath the winter‚Äôs sway‚Äî
   _How brief the roses be_!

Now shews the sun his head of gold
   With a superior brilliancy;
Now hides as were he dead and cold‚Äî
   _Alack and woe is me_.

O father! I will lave thy tomb
   With tear-drops well becoming me;
Thy tomb with flowery herbs perfume‚Äî
   _How brief the roses be_!




EPIGRAMS.
_From the Persian_.


1.


Hear what once the pigmy clever
   To the stupid giant said:
Things are not of highest value
   Which do highest rear their head;
The sluggish horse is nothing better
   Than the donkey lowest bred.



2.


The man who of his words is sparing
   His strength and weakness hidden keeps;
Think not every thicket empty,
   Perchance in one a tiger sleeps.



3.


If thou would‚Äôst ruin ‚Äôscape, and blackest woe,
   Unto these words, these precious words attend:
Never be heedless of a mortal foe,
   Nor choose a proud and envious man for friend.



4.


Sit down with your friends in delightful repose
   When war and contention you see ‚Äômidst your foes;
But when to an end their contentions they bring,
   Then, then seize the bow, and get ready the sling.



5.


The hungry hound upon the bone will pounce
   He prowling finds, and not mistrustful pass;
He asks not whom it did belong to once,
   The prophet‚Äôs camel or the sinner‚Äôs ass.



6.


Great Aaroun is dead, and is nothing, the man
   Who left forty castles replete with gold store;
But living though dead is the great Nourshwan,
   In the good name he left he has death triumphed o‚Äôer.



7.


Though God provides our daily bread,
   Yet all must seek that bread I ween;
Though all must die, there is no need
   To rush the dragon‚Äôs jaws between.



8.
THE KING AND HIS FOLLOWERS.


If in the boor‚Äôs garden the King eats a pear,
His servants rapacious the tree will uptear;
For every five eggs he gives bounteously, more
Than five hundred fowls will his armies devour.



9.
THE DEVOUT MAN AND THE TYRANT.


If the half of a loaf the devout man receives,
The half of that half to the wretched he gives;
But no sooner a tyrant one kingdom has ta‚Äôen,
Than the wish of his heart is another to gain.



10.
THE CAT AND THE BEGGAR.


If a cat could the power of flying enjoy,
She all the world‚Äôs sparrows would quickly destroy;
If power in the hands of a beggar you place,
No mercy he‚Äôll show to the beggarly race.



11.
THE KING AND TAYLOR.


The taylor who travels in far foreign lands,
Can always get bread by the work of his hands;
But the King who from throne and from country has fled,
Must oft without supper go sighing to bed.



12.
GOLD COIN AND STAMPED LEATHER.


Of the children of wisdom how like is the face
To pure gold that‚Äôs accepted in every place;
But the ignorant great are much like leather cash,
At home which though current, abroad is but trash.



13.


So much like a friend with your foe ever deal,
That you never need dread the least scratch from his steel;
But ne‚Äôer with your friend deal so much like a foe,
That you ever must dread from his faulchion a blow.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
