THE BROTHER AVENGED


I stood before my master‚Äôs board,
   The skinker‚Äôs office plying;
The herald-men brought tidings then
   That my brother was murdered lying.

I followed my lord unto his bed,
   By his dearest down he laid him;
Then my courser out of the stall I led,
   And with saddle and bit arrayed him.

I sprang upon my courser‚Äôs back,
   With the spur began to goad him;
And ere I drew his bridle to,
   Full fifteen leagues I rode him.

And when I came to the noisy hall
   Where the Kemps carouse were keeping,
O then I saw my mother dear
   O‚Äôer the corse of my brother weeping.

Then I laid an arrow on my good bow,
   The bow that never deceived me;
And straight I shot the King‚Äôs Kempions twelve,
   Of my brother who had bereaved me.

And then to the Ting I rode away,
   Where the judges twelve were seated;
Of six to avenge my brother I begged,
   And of six protection entreated.

For the third time rode I to the Ting,
   For deep revenge I lusted;
Up stood the liege-man of the King,
   And at me fiercely thrusted.

Up stood the liege-man of the King,
   With a furious thrust toward me;
And the Judges twelve rose in the Ting,
   And an outlaw‚Äôd man declared me.

Then I laid an arrow on my good bow,
   And the bow to its utmost bent I;
And into the heart of the King‚Äôs liege-man
   The sharp, sharp arrow sent I.

Then away from the Ting amain I sped,
   And my good steed clomb in hurry;
There was nothing for me but to hasten and flee,
   And myself ‚Äômong the woods to bury.

And hidden for eight long years I lay
   Amid the woods so lonely;
I‚Äôd nothing to eat in that dark retreat
   But grass and green leaves only.

I‚Äôd nothing to eat in that dark retreat,
   Save the grass and leaves I devoured;
No bed-fellows crept to the place where I slept,
   But bears that brooned and roared.

So near at hand was the holy tide
   Of our Lady of mercies tender;
The King of the Swedes his followers leads,
   And rides to the Church in splendour.

So I laid an arrow on my good bow,
   As I looked from the gap so narrow;
And into the heart of the Swedish King
   I sent the yard-long arrow.

Now lies on the ground the Swedish King,
   And the blood from his death-wound showers;
So blythe is my breast, though still I must rest
   Amid the forest bowers.




THE EYES


To kiss a pair of red lips small
   Full many a lover sighs;
If I kiss anything at all,
   Let it be Sophy‚Äôs eyes.
The eyes, the eyes, whose witcheries
   Have filled my heart with care;
Too dear I prize the eyes, the eyes
   Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.

Were I the Czar, my kingly crown,
   My troops and victories,
And fair renown I‚Äôd all lay down
   To kiss but Sophy‚Äôs eyes.
The charming eyes, whose witcheries
   Have filled my heart with care;
Too dear I prize the charming eyes
   Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.

Perhaps I‚Äôve seen a fairer face,
   Though hers may well surprise;
A form perhaps of lovelier grace,
   But, oh! the eyes, the eyes!
The matchless eyes, whose witcheries
   Have filled my heart with care;
I well may prize the matchless eyes
   Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.

What with the polished diamond-stone
   Can vie beneath the skies?
Oh, it is vied and far outshone
   By Sophy‚Äôs beaming eyes.
By Sophy‚Äôs eyes, whose witcheries
   Have filled my heart with care;
Well may I prize the beaming eyes
   Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.

The sun of June burns furiously,
   And brooks and meadows dries;
But, oh, with more intensity
   Burn cruel Sophy‚Äôs eyes!
The wicked eyes, whose witcheries
   Have filled my heart with care;
Too dear I prize the wicked eyes
   Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.

O, soon beneath their piercing ray,
   Like some parched plant which dies,
Wither shall I, poor youth, away?
   And all for Sophy‚Äôs eyes.
But bless the eyes, whose witcheries
   Have filled my heart with care;
Till Death I‚Äôll prize and bless the eyes
   Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.




HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON
_From the Greek_


With the leaves of the myrtle I‚Äôll cover my brand,
   Like Harmodius and Aristogiton of yore;
When the tyrant they slew, and their dear native land
   They caused with just laws to be governed once more.

O, beloved Harmodius! thou still art not dead,
   In the Isles of the Blest thou still livest, they say;
Where the swift-heel‚Äôd Achilles and bold Diomed
   Through sweet flowery meadows continually stray.

With the leaves of the myrtle I‚Äôll cover my blade,
   Like Harmodius and Aristogiton of yore;
Who, whilst the high rites to Athena were paid,
   The bold tyrant Hipparchus extended in gore.

And on earth ever, ever your glory shall glow,
   Harmodius and Aristogiton, sun-bright;
Because ye the damnable tyrant laid low,
   And restored to your country her law and her right.




MY DAINTY DAME


My dainty Dame, my heart‚Äôs delight,
Star of my watch, serene and bright;
Come to the green wood, mild is May,
Cosy the arbours, come away!

In me thy spouse and servant see,
To silvan hall I‚Äôll usher thee;
Thy bed shall be the leaves heaped high,
Thy organ‚Äôs note the cuckoo‚Äôs cry.
Thy covert warm the kindly wood,
No fairer form therein e‚Äôer stood.
Thy dress, my beauteous gem, shall be
Soft foliage stript from forest tree;
The foliage best the forest bore,
Served as a garb for Eve of yore.
Thou, too, throughout the summer day
Shalt rove around in Eve‚Äôs array.
My Eve thou art, my ever dear,
Thy Adam I‚Äôll attend and cheer.

Come to the green wood, come away,
The floor with grass and flowers is gay!
There ‚Äôneath no tree shalt thou descry
In churlish guise old jealousy.
Fear not my love, afar is now
The loon, thy tiresome lord, I trow;
To all a jest amidst his clan
He choler deals in Cardigan.
Here, nestled nigh the sounding sea,
In Ifor‚Äôs bush we‚Äôll ever be.
More bliss for us our fate propounds
On Taf‚Äôs green banks than Teivi‚Äôs bounds;
Thy caitiff wight is scarce aware
Where now we lurk, my little fair.
Ah! better here, in love‚Äôs sweet thrall,
To hark the cuckoo‚Äôs hearty call,
Than pine through life in castle hall!




GRASACH ABO
OR
THE CAUSE OF GRACE


O, Baillie Na Cortie! thy turrets are tall,
   Descried from their top is the oncoming foe;
Though numerous the warriors that watch on thy wall,
   Thy hope and thy trust are in Grasach Abo.

O, Baillie Na Cortie! thy chieftains abound
   With courage no dangers can ever lay low;
In the day of the fight can their equals be found,
   When is roared to the heaven‚Äôs heights Grasach Abo?

O, Baillie Na Cortie! brave helps thou hast nigh,
   Will rise at thy summons full quickly I trow;
The Shortuls, Roothes, Shees, clans so mighty and high,
   Will rise on the foemen of Grasach Abo.

O, Baillie Na Cortie! thy banner shall bound
   Blood red in the winds o‚Äôer the battle that blow;
When thy lion so gallant breathes terror around,
   And thy soldiers are shouting out Grasach Abo.

O, Baillie Na Cortie! thy armoury boasts
   The arms of great chiefs on the wall in a row;
Gilliepatrick let fall, and O More of the hosts,
   When they ran in red rout before Grasach Abo.

O, Baillie Na Cortie! when blazed the bright swords,
   Thy sons gave the Butlers a signal o‚Äôerthrow;
When Desmond was scattered with all his dark hordes,
   He loathed the wild war whoop of Grasach Abo.

O, Baillie Na Cortie! thou needest no aid
   Of strangers the day when the blood torrents flow;
The Brennaghs, Powrs, Parcels with buckler and blade,
   Shall triumph and feast with the Grasach Abo.

O, Baillie Na Cortie! thy bards hope to praise
   Thee, thee through long ages undarkened with woe;
And him, thy brave chieftain, his bountiful ways,
   And the heroes who bleed for the Grasach Abo.




DAGMAR


Sick in Ribe Dagmar‚Äôs lying,
   Soon she‚Äôll be in Ringsted‚Äôs wall;
All the Dames in Denmark dwelling
   Unto her she bids them call.

‚ÄúFetch me four, fetch five, I pray ye,
   Fetch me those for wisdom famed;
Fetch Sir Carl of Haves‚Äô sister,
   Little Kirstine is she named.

‚ÄúFetch the old, and fetch the youthful,
   Fetch the learned unto me;
Fetch the lovely little Kirstine,
   Worthy all respect is she.

‚ÄúCanst thou read and write, my darling?
   Canst thou ease the pains I bear?
Thou shalt ride upon my coursers,
   And the ruddy scarlet wear.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould I read and write, my lady,
   Blythely I would do the same;
Thy pains are than iron harder,
   ‚ÄôTis with grief I that proclaim.‚Äù

‚ÄôTwas the lovely little Kirstine,
   Took the book and read a space‚Äî
‚ÄúAh, thy pains than steel are harder,
   God Almighty help thy case!‚Äù




THE ELF BRIDE {21}


There was a youthful swain one day
   Did ted the new mown grass;
There came a gay and lovely may
   From out the nigh morass.
Clad in a dress of silk was she,
Green as the leaves which deck the tree,
Her head so winsomely to see
   With bulrush plaited was.

That lass he wooed, his suit she heeds,
   And married are the pair;
To bridal bed his wife he leads‚Äî
   But what befell him there?
He found, fear-stricken and amaz‚Äôd,
That he a rough oak trunk embrac‚Äôd,
Instead of the enchanting waist
   Of his mysterious fair.

Then straight abroad a voice he heard,
   Which sang the window through;
These were the words the voice proffer‚Äôd
   If my report be true:
‚ÄúCome out to her whom thou didst wed!
Upon my mead thy couch is spread.‚Äù
From this he guessed with some elf maid
   That he had had to do.




THE TREASURE DIGGER


O, would that with last and shoe I had stay‚Äôd,
   Without wild desires;
And, ah! no trust in Satan had laid,
   That prince of liars!

Each Saturday night, when slept the rest,
   Away I stroll‚Äôd
To the forest, so murky and drear, in quest
   Of buried gold.

And then I beheld the hopping fire glow
   The briar behind;
And down to the earth my wishing-rod low
   Itself declin‚Äôd.

I dug then, and gripped the chest‚Äôs ring amain,
   And held it stout;
But the copper deceitful burst in twain,
   And the fiends laughed out.

Just, just as long was the treasure my own,
   As I trembled with fright;
But soon as I held it secure, down, down
   It sank from sight.

Ye devilish pack, what grin ye at?
   I fell not your prey;
I‚Äôll trust no more in old women‚Äôs chat,
   And in cross-shaped way.

I go by my last and shoe to stay,
   Without wild desires;
And ne‚Äôer more in Satan I trust will lay,
   That prince of liars!




THE FISHER


The fisherman saddleth his good winged horse,
To be on the deep seems to him his best course.

Against the white strand loud and hoarse the wave breaks,
And towards the strand now the fisherman makes.

And up when the fisher his fishing-line drew,
A fine golden fish on the hook met his view.

Then he laughed in his beard: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve of fish seen a store,
But ne‚Äôer one with golden cloth kirtle before.

‚ÄúIf I a gold piece for each gold-scale possess‚Äôd,
With poverty I should no more be distrest.‚Äù

With its tail the fish ‚Äôgan the bench furious to smite,
And a strange dance it seemed to the fisherman‚Äôs sight.

‚ÄúThou wealthy man, be not, I pray thee, so gay,
A much quieter part a poor fisher should play.‚Äù

The golden fish heard every word as it lay,
Began straight to talk and discourse in this way:‚Äî

‚ÄúI‚Äôm full as rich, fisherman, as thou art poor,
And soon for thee happiness I will procure.

‚ÄúStraight cast me again in the ocean my home,
And a well-doing man thou, I swear, shalt become.

‚ÄúThe Queen of the ocean my mother is, know,
She linen and bolsters on thee shall bestow.

‚ÄúMy father is King in the depths of the sea,
And healthy and strong he shall cause thee to be.

‚ÄúMy lover he sorrows for me in the brine,
My golden cloth kirtle shall also be thine.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor the sovereign of fishes I care not a straw,
On myself, if I did, I but laughter should draw.

‚ÄúFor thy mother‚Äôs fine cushions I care little more,
My own Queen could make better ware any hour.

‚ÄúBut if thou to a wooer thy troth didst allot,
The repose of two lovers destroy I will not.‚Äù

The trembling gold fish in the water placed he:
‚ÄúFrom such wretched captures the Lord preserve me!

‚ÄúIf to-morrow a like one upon my hook bite,
I shall perish of hunger, poor miserable wight.‚Äù

He the rest of the day sat at home by his hearth
And spake not a word that repeating is worth.

He early next morn in his boat his seat took,
And straightway adjusted a bait to his hook.

And soon as he‚Äôd overboard cast the fish-line,
The float it descended deep under the brine.

Then he laughed in his beard, and with bitterness said:
‚ÄúA catch of another gold fish I have made!‚Äù

The thin lengthy line he up-drew half unwilling,
And, behold! there upon the hook hung a gold shilling.

And I can forsooth and for certainty say,
That he for delight had no rest the whole day.

But as oft as the line he up-drew from the tide,
Upon the hook never a fish he descried.

For whene‚Äôer for the fish he upon the hook sought,
He found that a shilling of gold he had caught.




THE CUCKOO


Abiding an appointment made,
Upon the weed-grown steep I stayed,
One morning mild when May was new,
And fresh the down was fraught with dew.
The meads were flowering, bright the woods,
The branches yielding thousand buds.
My lips employed in song the while
On Morfydd of the merry smile.
‚ÄôTwas then as round I cast my eye
With mighty wish the maid to spy;
Though, howsoe‚Äôer my sight I strained,
No glimpse of Morfydd I obtained.
I heard the cuckoo‚Äôs voice arise,
Singing the song which most I prize.
To each Bard true most sweet I trow
His music on the mountain‚Äôs brow.
Therefore, as called by courtesy,
I greeted him in poesy.

‚ÄúGood day, dear Cuckoo, with thy strain
A herald thou from heaven‚Äôs domain;
To us the tidings thou dost bear
Of summer, blissful season fair.
Of summer which to greenwood shade
Entices forth the Bard and maid;
Which decks with foliage dense the grove,
And through all nature breathes of love.
O, dear to me that note of thine,
It seasons love like choicest wine;
Whilst, doating fondness to chastise,
What cutting taunt in ‚ÄòCuckoo‚Äô lies!
But, pretty bird, I pray declare
Where lingereth now my lady fair?‚Äù

‚ÄúO, poet, what delusion great
Doth fill this year thy foolish pate?
‚ÄôTis harbouring a useless pain
One thought of her to entertain.
With all her store of winning charms,
She weds her to another‚Äôs arms.
Believe me, when I say to thee
A mate of thine she may not be.‚Äù

‚ÄúHush, hush, I‚Äôll not believe thy voice,
Dare not defame my bosom‚Äôs choice.
That nymph, the fairest ‚Äôneath the sun,
Has sworn an oath, a solemn one;
She vowed by her baptismal rite,
Beneath the bough one blessed night,
Her hand my own enclasping hard,
To live and die with me, her Bard.
The minister that mystic night
Was Madog Benfras, matchless wight.
Her suitors all may vainly sigh,
How should she wed, whom wed have I?
‚ÄôTis false, O Bird, what thou dost state,
And waste of time with thee to prate.
Folly and drunkenness, ‚Äôtis plain,
Have got possession of thy brain.
Hence with thy news, and get thee cool,
Thou art, I fear, a very fool!‚Äù

‚ÄúO, Dafydd, who the fool but thou,
Talking this guise beneath the bough?
Another husband chooses she,
Whose charms deceitful captured thee.
The Damsel of the neck of snow
Is now another‚Äôs wife, I trow.
To love another‚Äôs looks not well,
The Bow Bach owns the blooming belle.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor what thou‚Äôst sung within the grove,
With malice filled, about my love,
May days of winter come with speed,
The summer and the sun recede;
Hoar frost upon the foliage fall,
The wood and branches withering all.
And thou with piercing cold be slain,
Thou horrid bird of hateful strain!‚Äù

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
