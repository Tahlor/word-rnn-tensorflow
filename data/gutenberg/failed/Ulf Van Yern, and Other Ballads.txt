ULF VAN YERN


It was youthful Ulf Van Yern
   Goes before the King to stand:
‚ÄúTo avenge my father‚Äôs death
   Lend me warriors of thy band.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf my kemps I‚Äôll lend thee them
   Who to follow thee consent;
Ask‚Äôst thou Vidrik Verlandson
   Thou wilt further thy intent.

‚ÄúI will lend thee of my men,
   Thou shalt have the very flower;
Vidrik, and stark Diderik,
   Many kemps have felt their power.

‚ÄúThey are heroes strong and bold
   Who have battles often won;
Feared are they in every land
   Where their names‚Äô renown has gone.‚Äù

In walked he, the good Dane King,
   Glittering like the morning star:
‚ÄúWhich of ye, my Danish swains,
   Will attend my friend to war?‚Äù

Stalked the King along the floor,
   Bore a gold cup in his hand:
‚ÄúWhich of ye, my courtmen, will,
   Follow Wolf with shield and brand?‚Äù

To their mouths their hats they held,
   None to answer him made haste,
Save bold Vidrik Verlandson,
   Of them all he made a jest.

It was Vidrik Verlandson
   Of his comrades made a sport:
‚ÄúSure ‚Äôtis but to guzzle mead
   We are gathered here at court.‚Äù

Wrathful Diderik straight became,
   Frantic at that word he grew;
Off he smote two warriors‚Äô heads,
   At the King‚Äôs foot them he threw.

Then spake Vidrik Verlandson,
   His whole thought on honor lies:
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll dispatch our messenger
   And not go in stealthy guise.‚Äù

It was youthful Hammergray
   Hurried from the city gate;
Every one on him that looked
   Lost his voice and colour straight.

Hark away, young Hammergray,
   Gold is glittering on thy breast;
Ne‚Äôer was found or hawk or hound
   Could with Hammer‚Äôs speed contest.

Pearls upon his bosom shone,
   Folks thereat astounded gaze:
Fowl was none beneath the sun
   Could with youthful Hammer race.

Swift into the King‚Äôs high hill
   Bounded youthful Hammergray:
He was nimble at the tongue,
   And could speak in gallant way.

‚ÄúKing of Brattens Vendel, hail!
   And the rest that fill your hall;
Ulf Van Yern to-morrow comes
   To avenge his father‚Äôs fall.‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter had he be at home
   Tending sheep beneath the height,
Better than a message send
   That he thither comes to fight.

‚ÄúBetter had he crawl at home
   Like a worm the rock beneath,
Than the war-like struggle dare
   Where his father sank in death.

‚ÄúHe at home had better stay,
   Crouch and shake the bush below;
One blow only stood his sire,
   He‚Äôll not stand me half a blow.‚Äù

‚ÄúKing of Brattens Vendel, hear,
   Keep your tongue behind your tooth;
Quickly grows the young whelp up,
   Full of threatening fangs his mouth.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the world no warrior wight
   Lives for whom I need to care,
Save ‚Äôtis Vidrik Verlandson,
   And I trow he‚Äôll not be there.‚Äù

Answered then the Hammergray,
   Answered to the Monarch‚Äôs fright:
‚ÄúIt is Vidrik Verlandson
   Will our army lead in fight.‚Äù

Rose a Brattens Vendel kemp,
   And he shouted lustily:
‚ÄúWell, full well, I Vidrik know,
   Offspring of a blacksmith he.

‚ÄúOnce was I at Birtingsborg
   As the kempions drank their fill,
There he played a play which lives
   In my mind, and ever will.

‚ÄúFifteen kemps to death he smote,
   And he deemed it but as game;
Nigh at hand I gazing stood,
   Ashy pale my cheeks became.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen now, young Hammergray,
   Strongly I entreat of thee,
If of Vidrik aught thou know,
   Not to keep it hid from me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSick in bed if Vidrik lay,
   Nor could sword nor buckler yield,
Many a Danish swain you‚Äôd find
   Would await you in the field.‚Äù

Loudly answered then the King,
   Through his veins rushed courage warm:
‚ÄúI‚Äôll to-morrow, if I live,
   Meet ye in the battle‚Äôs storm.‚Äù

From beside the King‚Äôs right hand
   Rose a kemp, a stalwart one:
‚ÄúWhat care we for such like foes?
   Vidrik‚Äôs but a blacksmith‚Äôs son.‚Äù

It was the young Hammergray,
   At that word his wrath boiled o‚Äôer;
Straight he smote the kempion dead,
   Dead he tumbled on the floor.

Said the Monarch with a cry,
   While with rage his cheek grew white:
‚ÄúWhy hast thou my bravest kemp
   Smit to death before my sight?‚Äù

Thereto answered Hammergray,
   As the King he fiercely eyed:
‚ÄúI could ne‚Äôer with patience hear
   Verland‚Äôs valiant son decried.‚Äù

Straight away rushed Hammergray,
   Soon he stood by Vidrik knight:
‚ÄúWhet your spears, and sharp your swords,
   For the King is bent on fight.‚Äù

All the mirky night they rode
   O‚Äôer the dusky heathery down,
Still a light like that of day
   From their polished weapons shone.

Over Birting‚Äôs moor they rode,
   And through Birting‚Äôs swamp in haste;
Full seven hundred were the kemps,
   All in hard cuirasses cas‚Äôd.

Towards Birting on they rode,
   Birting‚Äôs city they rode through;
Then they formed them in a ring,
   And made Vidrik chief anew.

On the down their flag they pitched,
   Therein you a lion may spy;
Now must many an innocent man
   Bid to life a long good-bye!

Long they fought with sword and bow,
   Each essayed his best to do;
From their brows burst ruddy sweat,
   From their bucklers fire out flew.

It was then the Vendel King,
   From his helm a glance he cast:
‚ÄúSay, who leads that band to-day,
   That my people fall so fast?‚Äù

Straight replied the little page,
   To the King rode next of all:
‚ÄúSir, ‚Äôtis Vidrik Verlandson,
   Sits upon his courser tall.‚Äù

Answered one of the King‚Äôs kemps,
   Who had been in many fields:
‚ÄúYes, ‚Äôtis Vidrik Verlandson,
   Mimmering {13} in his hand he wields.‚Äù

Thereto made the King reply,
   As another glance he throws:
‚Äú‚ÄôGainst the shield I ill shall fight
   Which the tongs and hammer shows.

‚Äú‚ÄôGainst the shield I ill shall fight
   Which the tongs and hammer bears,
This day I am doomed to die,
   For fierce Vidrik no one spares.

‚ÄúHeathen wight, and Christian knight,
   I would fight with glad and fain;
Only not with Verland‚Äôs son,
   For from him I scathe must gain.‚Äù

Ha! Hurrah! the Vendel King
   In his steed the rowels drove;
Desperate he at Vidrik went,
   Desperate he to fell him strove.

Bravely done, thou Vendel King,
   Fast and hard thy strokes are plied
E‚Äôen to his good saddle bow
   Vidrik stoops his helm of pride.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve from thee borne eighteen blows,
   They are, Sir, nor more nor fewer,
For thy kingly honor now
   But one blow from me endure.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf thou eighteen blows hast borne
   Be they fewer or be they more,
I‚Äôll the self-same number take,
   Gift of love can break their power.‚Äù

Forth a silken thread he drew
   Tied it round his helm of gold:
‚ÄúMy heart‚Äôs dear shall never hear
   Blow of blacksmith laid me cold.‚Äù

Vidrik spake to Mimmering:
   ‚ÄúShow thou‚Äôrt yet for something good;
I can say for fifteen years
   I more fiercely have not hew‚Äôd.‚Äù

Grasped he then the hilt so hard
   From his nails that blood outstarted,
On the Monarch‚Äôs helm he hew‚Äôd,
   To the navel him he parted.

Shouted Vidrik Verlandson,
   Standing on the verdant height:
‚ÄúBe there one of all your host
   Who has further wish to fight?‚Äù

Now the Brattens Vendel King
   Lies out pouring blood like water:
Vengeance now has Ulf Van Yern,
   Vengeance for his father‚Äôs slaughter.

It was youthful Hammergray
   Glanced around the bloody field:
‚ÄúSo like mice in their first sleep
   Hushed the foemen lie, and still‚Äôd.‚Äù

Gladly back with Ulf Van Yern
   Rode the Dane King‚Äôs chivalry;
For his sire avenged he thanked
   Vidrik oft and fervently.




THE CHOSEN KNIGHT


Sir Oluf rode forth over hill and lea
   Full seven mile broad and seven mile wide,
But no one living discovered he
   Who a joust with him dare ride.

He saw, whilst forward glancing,
A gallant knight advancing,
Black was his courser, his helm was lac‚Äôd,
He came with bounding haste.

Upon his spurs all gory
Twelve gilded birdies bore he;
Each time with the rowel he pricked his horse
The birdies sang with all their force.

Twelve gilt wheels on his bridle
He bore, nor were they idle;
Each time through them the breezes blew,
How quickly around the little wheels flew.

He carried before his breast
A long lance, placed in rest;
Far sharper than diamond was that lance,
It laid Sir Oluf in deadly trance.

Aloft on his helm he show‚Äôd
   A chaplet of red glare;
Three maidens in proof of their love bestow‚Äôd,
   The youngest was so fair.

Sir Oluf enquired of the knight,
An he were come down from the realms of light:
‚ÄúArt thou the Christ, for if thou be,
I‚Äôll willingly bend before thee the knee?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not the Christ of power,
Thou need‚Äôst not before me cower;
An unknown knight thou see‚Äôst in me,
Sent forth by three maids of high degree.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf thou be a chosen knight
   Whom maidens three have sent this way,
Then for love of those damsels bright,
   Thou shalt joust with me to-day.‚Äù

The first course they together rode
   Of their coursers trial made they,
The second course they together rode
   Their best manhood well display‚Äôd they.

The third joust they together rode
   Neither one the other humbled,
But the fourth joust they together rode
   Dead to the green earth they tumbled.

Now on the wold the heroes lie,
   With their blood the grass is red;
In the chamber high sit the maids and sigh,
   But the youngest soon is dead.




SIR SWERKEL


There‚Äôs a dance in the hall of Sir Swerkel the Childe,
There dances fair Kirstine, her hair hanging wild.

There dance the good King and his nobles so gay,
Fair Kirstine before them she warbles a lay.

His hand to the maiden Sir Swerkel stretched free:
‚ÄúCome hither and dance, little Kirstine, with me.‚Äù

Her finger he pressed, and moved up to her near:
‚ÄúSweet Kirstine, I pray thee become my heart‚Äôs dear.‚Äù

Her finger he pressed, on her sandal trod he:
‚ÄúFair Kirstine, with pity my agonies see!‚Äù

They danced to the left, and they danced to the right,
And her troth the fair damsel bestowed on the knight.

Upon him Sir Swerkel his red mantle throws,
And to the high hall to his mother he goes.

‚ÄúHail, hail as thou sittest here, dear mother mine!
I come from betrothing the little Kirstine.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur Lady forbid, and our Lady forfend,
Relations like ye to betroth should pretend.

‚ÄúIn wedlock united ye never must be,
For brother and sister, believe me, are ye.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow tell me, I pray thee, O dear mother mine!
What time thou didst bring forth the little Kirstine.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe time that thou wast on thy journey to Rome,
I bore the sweet flowret that‚Äôs now in full bloom.

‚ÄúWhilst thou to the sepulchre holy wast gone,
I bore the fair mirror thy love that hast won.

‚ÄúIn the court of the Queen she was reared up with care,
And scarlet and sable accustomed to wear.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow give me thy counsel, O dear mother mine,
How I may forget her, the little Kirstine?‚Äù

‚ÄúGo chase thou the hart, and go chase thou the hind,
And thou wilt her image soon chase from thy mind.

‚ÄúGo chase thou the hart, and go chase thou the roe,
And thou thy love-longing wilt quickly forego.‚Äù

He chased the proud hart, and he chased the swift hind,
But he never could chase the fair maid from his mind.

He chased the tall hart, and he chased the sleek roe,
But the longing of love from his mind would not go.

So the knight from the country was driven at last,
And into a cloister the maiden was cast.

No little bird shaped from the far land its flight
Than enquiry she made for her dear betrothed knight.

A bird ne‚Äôer so little across the sea stray‚Äôd
But he enquired after his dear betrothed maid.




FINN AND THE DAMSEL
OR
THE TRIAL OF WITS.


‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs rifer than leaves?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúDew is more rife,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúHotter than fire?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúThe face of a kind-hearted man,‚Äù she replied,

‚ÄúWhen chance to his hut the stranger doth guide,
And unable he is for his guest to provide.‚Äù

‚ÄúSwifter than wind?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúThe vigour of woman,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúSweeter than honey?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúThe words of affection,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúRanker than bane?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúA foeman‚Äôs abuse,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúMore black than the crow?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúDeath is yet blacker,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúMore sharp than the sword?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúWoman‚Äôs sense at a pinch,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs best of all gems?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúA knife or a dirk,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúSofter than down?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúLove‚Äôs palm on your cheek,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúA ship for all cargoes?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúThe tongs of the smith,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúWhiter than snow?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúTruth is more white,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúHow many trees are there?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúThe green and the sere make two,‚Äù she replied.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs reddest of red?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúThe flush of the freeman when praised,‚Äù she replied.
‚ÄúOr when praise to his merit is meanly denied.‚Äù

‚ÄúThan the radish more brittle?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúThe nature of woman,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúWhat never grows old nor betied?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe friendship of man,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúWhat does woman love best?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúA fair or a dance,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs best for your colour?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúCool air and good sleep,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúHow many steeds are there?‚Äù Finn cried,
‚ÄúBut two, a horse and a mare,‚Äù she replied.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs best of all food?‚Äù Finn cried,
‚ÄúNought better than milk,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúWhat adorns a man most?‚Äù Finn cried,
‚ÄúHigh deeds, humble words,‚Äù the damsel replied.

‚ÄúThe worst of all fare?‚Äù Finn cried.
‚ÄúStrong drink, if it be too freely supplied,
Or the prate of a fool,‚Äù the damsel replied.




EPIGRAMS BY CAROLAN


On Friars


Would‚Äôst thou on good terms with friars live,
   Ever be humble and admiring;
All they ask of thee freely give,
   And in return be nought requiring.



On a surly Butler,
who had refused him admission to the cellar


O Dermod Flynn it grieveth me
   Thou keepest not Hell‚Äôs portal;
As long as thou should‚Äôst porter be,
   Thou would‚Äôst admit no mortal.



Lines


How deadly the blow I received
When of thee, O my darling, bereaved!
No more up the hill I shall bound,
No strength in my poor foot is found;
No joy o‚Äôer my visage shall break
‚ÄôTill from out the cold earth I awake.
Of the corn like the very top grain,
Or the pine ‚Äômongst the shrubs of the plain,
Or the moon ‚Äômongst the starlets above,
Went thou amongst women, my love!

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
