INTRODUCTION


Mathias Casimire Sarbiewski (1595-1640) vas a Polish Jesuit whose
neo-Latin Horatian odes and Biblical paraphrases gained immediate
European acclaim upon their first publication in 1625 and 1628.[1] The
fine lyric quality of Sarbiewski‚Äôs poetry, and the fact that he often
fused classical and Christian motifs, made a critic like Hugo Grotius
actually prefer the ‚Äúdivine Casimire‚Äù to Horace himself, and his
popularity among the English poets is evidenced by an impressive number
of translations.

G. Hils‚Äôs _Odes of Casimire_ (1646), here reproduced by permission from
the copy in the Henry E. Huntington Library, is the earliest English
collection of translations from the verse of the Polish Horace. It is
also the most important. Acknowledged translations of individual poems
appeared in Henry Vaughan‚Äôs _Olor Iscanus_ (1651), Sir Edward
Sherburne‚Äôs _Poems and Translations_ (1651), the _Miscellany Poems and
Translations by Oxford Hands_ (1685), Isaac Watts‚Äôs _Horae Lyricae_
(1706), Thomas Brown‚Äôs _Works_ (1707-8), and John Hughes‚Äôs _The Ecstasy.
An Ode_ (1720). Unacknowledged paraphrases from Casimire include Abraham
Cowley‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Extasie,‚Äù[2] John Norris‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Elevation,‚Äù[3] and a
number of Isaac Watts‚Äôs pious and moral odes.[4] Latin editions of
Casimire‚Äôs odes appeared in London in 1684, and in Cambridge in 1684
and 1689.

Another striking example of the direct influence of Casimire upon
English poetry is presented by Edward Benlowes‚Äôs _Theophila_ (1652).
This long-winded epic of the soul exhibits not only a general
indebtedness in imagery and ideas, but also direct borrowings of whole
lines from Hils‚Äôs _Odes of Casimire_. One example will have to suffice:

  Casimire, Ode IV, 44

      _Theophila_, XIII, 68

  Let th‚Äô _Goth_ his strongest chaines prepare,
  The _Scythians_ hence mee captive teare,
  My mind being free with you, I‚Äôle stare
  The Tyrants in the face....

    Then let fierce Goths their strongest chains prepare;
    Grim Scythians me their slave declare;
    My soul being free, those tyrants in the face I‚Äôll stare.

Casimire‚Äôs greatest achievement was in the field of the philosophic
lyric, and in a number of cases he anticipated poetic techniques and
motifs which later grew popular also with the English poets. Thus, long
before Denham and Marvell, he practised the technique of investing the
scenes of nature with a moral or spiritual significance. A¬†comparison
of Casimire‚Äôs loco-descriptive first epode on the estate of the Duke of
Bracciano with Denham‚Äôs _Cooper‚Äôs Hill_ (1642) reveals that the Polish
poet was the first to mix description with moral reflection, and to
choose the gentle hills, the calmly flowing river, and a retired country
life as symbols of the Horatian golden mean.

Some of Casimire‚Äôs richest imagery is found in his paraphrases of
_Canticles_, and particularly in Ode IV, 21. Parts of this ode provide a
striking parallel to the famous fifth stanza of Marvell‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Garden.‚Äù
In it Horace and Virgil meet with Solomon, the _hortus conclusus_ of the
Hebrew poet merging with the landscape of retirement as we find it in
Virgil‚Äôs eclogues or in Horace‚Äôs second and sixteenth epodes. Much of
Casimire‚Äôs poetry, is indeed best understood as a conscious effort to
apply the allegorical technique of _Canticles_ to the classical _beatus
ille_-themes,[5] just as his thought presents an interesting combination
of Stoic and Platonic ideas.

The Polish poet, who was a university professor and a doctor of
theology, may easily have learned from the Hermetic writers how to
combine these great classical traditions. There is direct proof of
Casimire‚Äôs familiarity with the Hermetic tradition in his Ode II,¬†5
(‚ÄúE¬†Rebus Humanis Excessus‚Äù), which is a paraphrase of _Libellus¬†I_,
sections 25 and 26.[6] Since Henry Vaughan was familiar with Casimire‚Äôs
poetry, it is reasonable to suspect that Vaughan‚Äôs own treatment of
Hermetic motifs owed much to this influence. If one compares Vaughan‚Äôs
religious nature lyrics and Casimire‚Äôs odes, a¬†number of common poetical
motifs are easily found, and so we are here again faced with the fact
that themes which became popular in England in the mid-seventeenth
century were anticipated in the Latin odes of Casimire.[7]

Hermetic ideas are also encountered in Casimire‚Äôs third epode,
which combines a Horatian Stoicism with a neo-Platonlc or Hermetic
interpretation of the classical landscape of retirement. An avowed reply
to Horace‚Äôs second epode, it expands the Horatian philosophy through the
addition of three new themes: the theme of solitude, the theme of the
Earthly Paradise, and the theme of Nature as a divine hieroglyph. Its
presentation of the garden ecstasy of the retired _beatus vir_ thus
strikes the same note to which we know from Mildmay Fane‚Äôs ‚ÄúTo
Retiredness‚Äù and Andrew Marvell‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Garden.‚Äù In slightly adapted
form, these themes were to flourish in the poetry of the Countess
of Winchilsea, Isaac Watts, John Hughes, and a number of early
eighteenth-century nature poets.

In the Romantic period Casimire‚Äôs fame was again revived. While still a
young man, Coleridge planned a complete translation of Casimire‚Äôs odes,
but never finished more than the ode ‚ÄúAd Lyram.‚Äù It was also Coleridge
who said that with the exception of Lucretius and Statius he knew no
Latin poet, ancient or modern, who could be said to equal Casimire
in boldness of conception, opulence of fancy, or beauty of
versification.[8] A¬†knowledge of the themes and techniques of this
Latin poet should therefore be of interest to all students of English
poetry.

la Compagnie de J√©sus (Bruxelles et Paris, 1896), VII, 627-646.

2. In the preface to _The Ecstasy. An Ode_ (1720), John Hughes comments
on Cowley‚Äôs indebtedness, in ‚ÄúThe Extasie,‚Äù to Casimire.

3. Norris‚Äôs indebtedness has been pointed out by Hoxie N. Fairchild,
_Religious Trends in English Poetry_ (New York, 1939-¬†), I, 110, n.¬†21.

4. Compare Watts‚Äôs ‚ÄúFalse Greatness,‚Äù ‚Äú‚ÄôTis Dangerous to Follow the
Multitude,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Kingdom of the Wise Man‚Äù to Casimire‚Äôs Ode IV, 34;
IV, 10; and IV,¬†3.

5. By this term is understood the themes presented in Horace‚Äôs second
epode on the happy country life.

7. No study has as yet been made of Casimire‚Äôs influence upon English
literature, but I hope shortly to publish the results of my own
investigation of this problem.

8. Coleridge prefaced his translation of the ode ‚ÄúAd Lyram‚Äù with this
remark. See also _Biographia Literaria_, ed. John Shawcross (Oxford,
1907), II, 209. For further critical estimates, see Sir John Bowring,

      When the hatefull forces of the Thracians departed out of
      _Pannonia_.

  Jam min√¶ s√¶vi cecidere belli:
  Jam profanatis mal√® pulsa terris
  Et salus, & pax niveis revisit
        Oppida bigis:
  Iam fides, & fas, & am√¶na pr√¶ter
  Faustitas, l√¶to volat arva curru:
  Iam fluunt passim pretiosa largis
        S√¶cula rivis.
  Candidi soles veterisq; ven√¶
  Fontibus nati revocantur Anni:
  Grandinat Gemmis, riguoq; C≈ìlum
        Depluit Auro.

      The threats of cruell Warre now cease:,
      In stead of them safety and peace,
      Banish‚Äôd th‚Äôunhallowed earth, doe please
            ‚ÄôReturne in their white Waine;
      Faith joyn‚Äôd with Truth, and Plenty too
      O‚Äôre pleasant fields doe nimbly goe;
      The precious Ages past, doe flow
            With liberall streames againe.
      Cleare dayes, such yeares as were of old
      Recalled are, o‚Äôth‚Äô ancient mold,
      The Heavens hayle Pearles, and molten Gold
            Doth raine down-right in showres;

  Meq; veraci cecinisse plectro
  Inter Octobreis, tua festa, pompas,
  Prisca _Saturni_ rediisse s√¶cla,
        Approbat Orbis.
  Aurei patrum niveiq; mores,

      Whilst I with my Prophetique string
      Thy Winter feastivalls doe sing,
      The whole world doth with Ecchoes ring
            Old _Saturn‚Äôs_ age is ours.
      Our Fathers pure and golden rule
      Exil‚Äôd as farre as farthest Thule,
      Justice from bright _Olympus_ schoole
            Comes boldly back againe.

  Lactis, & fusi per aprica mellis
  Garruli Campos secu√™re rivi:
  Et superfuso tumu√™re plen√¶
        Nectare rip√¶.
  L√¶tior vulg√≤ seges inquietis
  Fluctuat culmis, titubantq; frugum

  Pastor Erranteis comitatus H≈ìdos

  Mugiunt Colles, & anhela fessis
        Silva Iuvencis.

      The streams which Milk and Honey yeild,
      Their passage cut through open field,
      And the full banks with Nectar swell‚Äôd
            Doe drowne the flowrie plaine.
      The glad Corne in the restles stalke
      Waves, and the fields as wee doe walke,
      So fruitfull reele, to any balke
            The Heat no spight doth owe.
      The Herdsmans Pipe to‚Äôs wandring Goats,
      Provokes the Grashoppers hoarse notes;
      The tyred Herd with strayned throats,
            Makes Hills and Woods to low.

  Pace subsultant juga, pace rident
  Tetrica rupes: leve separatos
  Otium colleis amat, & sequestri
        Gaudia pagi.
  Te _Ceres_ flavis redimita culmis,
  Magne pacati moderator orbis,
  Te suis √Üstas opulenta Circum-

  Supplici Myrtus tibi servit umbr√¢,
  Serviunt Lauri: tibi celsa long√®
  Quercus assurgit, tremuloq; pinus
        Vertice nutat.
  Siderum pr√¶ses, dominusq; terr√¶,
  Lucid√¢ Romam speculatus aree,
  Regna tranquillet, Cupidoq; patrem
        Te velit orbi.

      The Mountaines leape, and rough Rocks smile
      For gentle Peace rejoyceth still
      Such solitary roomes to fill
            Hills set apart, ‚Äôlone Townes.
      _Ceres_ with yellow Chaplet, and
      The Summer rich with eares doth stand,
      Great Prince of our appeased Land,
            Thee to encompasse round.
      The Myrtle begs with humble shade
      To serve thee and the Laurel‚Äôs glade;
      The lofty Oake doth rise; Its head
            The trembling Pine doth bow;
      Hee that o‚Äôre Starrs and earth hath powre,
      Beholding us, from his bright Towre,
      Calms all, and sets thee father o‚Äôre
            The covetous world below.

  Laurus annosum tibi signet √¶vum:
  Fata te norint, properentque parc√¶
  Nescium carpi tibi destinatos
        Stamen in annos.
  Qu√¶q; formosos sedet inter igneis,
  Sedulam pro te miserata _Romam_
  Virgo, quam circum glomerantur albis
        Astra choreis.
  Curet effusas Latii querelas,
  Virginum castas juvenumque voces
  Curet, & votis procerum reclinem
        accommodet aurem.

      The Laurell signe long life to thee,
      Let Fates and destinies agree
      To twine thy thred, which cannot bee
            Cut ‚Äôtill th‚Äôappointed time.
      May shee amidst those glorious fires,
      For thy sake, pittying our desires,
      ‚ÄôBout whom the beauteous starrs inquires,
            And flowing measures swim;
      May shee, I say, our Country‚Äôs griefe
      Cure, and the chast complaints releive
      Of all our youth, and willing eares
            Apply to th‚Äô praiers of all our Peeres.




  Ad Aurelium Lycum.

  _Ode 2. Lib.¬†1._

  N√® plus √¶quo de advers√¢ fortun√¢ queratur.

      To _Aurelius Lycas_.

      Ode 2. Li.¬†1.

      _That hee would not complaine too much of adverse fortune._

  Indignas, Lyce, n√¶nias,
      Et m√¶stum gemitu pectus, & hispidis
  Frontem nubibus expedi,
      Cum Sol non solito lumine riserit,
  Et fortuna volubilis
      Fati difficilem jecerit aleam.
  Quod vexant hodi√© Noti,
      Cras lambent hilares √¶quor √Ütesi√¶.
  M≈ìstum sol hodi√® caput,
      Cras l√¶tum roseo promet ab √¶quore.
  Alterno redeunt choro
      Risus & gemitus, & madidis prop√®
  Sicci cum Lacrymis joci.
      Nascuntur mediis gaudia luctibus,
  Sic fatis placitum. suis
      Tempestiva fluunt fata periculis.

      Unmanly howlings, _Lycuas_, leave,
      Thy sad breast doe not vex, nor grieve;
      Thy rugged brow from cloudes set free,
      Although with usuall beames ‚Äôon thee
      The Sun not shines; or fortune late
      Hath throwne the hardest chance of Fate.
      With th‚Äô waves, that South windes tosse to day,
      The cheerfull Easterne gales will play;
      The Sun that now hangs downe his head,
      With joy from blushing _Thetis_ bed
      I‚Äôth‚Äô morne will rise. Laughter and woe
      Keepe time, and in their courses goe.
      Cleare merriment succeeds wet eyes,
      And joyes in mid‚Äôst of sorrows rise.
      Thus pleaseth it the Fates, that flow
      With various hazards here below.

  Fessos duxit heri boves,
      Dat magnis hodi√® jura Quiritibus:
  Et qu√¶ bobus ademerat,
      Imponit Gabiis, & Curibus juga.
  Idem Phosphorus aspicit
      Magnum quem tenuem viderat Hesperus.
  Quod si seria ludicris
      Fortuna placeat texere; Rusticus
  Hesternam repetet casam,
      Ridentis populi non humilis jocus:
  Et queis rexerat omnia,
      Findet laurigeris ligna securibus.
  Quod si defuerit salix
      Fasces pauperibus subjiciet focis.

      Hee who his Oxen tyr‚Äôd, did drive,
      Doth lawes to day, to th‚Äô City give:
      And the same yokes he tooke from those,
      Upon the Citizens impose.
      The day-starre great, that man doth see,
      Whom th‚ÄôEvening saw in low degree.
      But if the things that serious are
      With Fortunes pastimes to compare
      Doth please you; See, this Country-man
      Betakes himselfe to‚Äôs farme againe,
      Of‚Äôs jeering neighbours th‚Äôonly sport,
      And with those Axes which i‚Äôth‚Äô Court
      Hee ruled all with, Cleaves his wood,
      Whose Helves are made of Laurell good.
      And if a want of wood there growes,
      The _Fasces_ on the fire he throwes.




  Ad _Tarquinium Lavinum_.

  Od. 13. lib.¬†1.

  Non si Sol semel occidit,
    Non rubris iterum surget ad Indiis;
  Nec si quos celeris rot√¶
    Sors non exiguo proruit impetu,
  Non lapsos iterum levet,
    Arguto docilis ludere cum joco.
  Ne spem projice, _Tarquini_:
    Cujus p√¶n√® retro lambere pulverem
  Et vestigia diceris,
    Cum fortuna levem verterit orbitam,
  Effusam super & luto
    Fumantem poteris cernere purpuram.
  Tunc & risibus abstine,
    Neu turpi domino Lumina paveris:
  Neu calces nimium, memor
    Fortun√¶ geminam s√¶pe jaci pilam.


      To _Tarquinius Lavinus_.

      _Ode 13. lib.¬†1._

      As if the Sun that once doth set,
        From th‚Äô blushing East a new birth doth not get
      As if that those whom Fortunes frowne
        By the swift violence of her wheele, throwes down,
      Shee would not raise again with ease,
        So active in such nimble sports as these.
      Despaire not (Sir) whose footsteps now
        Thou‚Äôrt said to kisse, and lick the dust of‚Äôs shooe,
      Let Fortune her light wheele but turne,
        And then _Tarquinius_, thou shalt soon discerne
      From his proud height, him downward thrust,
        His trampled robes smoking in mire and dust.
      Thy jeeres and laughter then forbeare,
        His all-bespattred lookes thou shalt not feare,
      Nor trample on, remembring how
        Fortune a double ball doth often throw.




  Ad _Publium Memmium_.

  _Ode 2. Lib.¬†2._

  Vit√¶ human√¶ brevitatem benefactis extendendam esse.

  Qua tegit Canas mod√≤ bruma valleis,
  Sole vicinos jaculante monteis
  Deteget rursum. Tibi cum nivosa
        Bruma senecta
  In caput seris cecidit pruinis,
  Decidet nunquam. Cita fugit √Üstas,
  Fugit Autumnus, fugient propinqui
        Tempora veris:
  At tibi frigus, capitiq; cani
  Semper h√¶rebunt, neq; multa Nardus
  Nec parum gratum repetita dement
        Serta colorem.
  Una quem nobis dederat juventus:
  Una te nobis rapiet senectus:
  Sed potes, _Publi_, geminare magn√¢
        S√¶cula fam√¢,
  Quem sui raptum gemu√™re cives.
  Hic diu vixit. Sibi quisq; famam
  Scribat H√¶redem: rapiunt avar√¶
        Cetera Lun√¶.


      To _Publius Memmius_.

      _Ode 2. Lib.¬†2._

      _That the shortnesse of mans life is to bee lengthened
      by good deeds._

      The Valleys, now, all clad in gray
      By Winter, when Sol darts his ray
      On neighbouring hills, hee‚Äôl naked lay,
            As heretofore.
      But when the winter of thy yeares
      With snow, within thy locks appeares,
      When hoary frost shall dye thine haires,
            It parts no more.
      Summer, and Autumn‚Äôs quickly gone,
      Th‚Äôapproaching Spring will passe as soon:
      Gray hayres, and chilling cold alone
            With thee will stay.
      To thy ill colour, Nard distill‚Äôd,
      Nor the renew‚Äôd perfumes o‚Äôth‚Äô field
      Of flowres, can any vertue yeild,
            Or tak‚Äôt away.
      Thee, whom thy youth hath giv‚Äôn t√≥ day.
      At night old age will take away.
      Thy time to double, is, to lay
            A fame most bright.
      Whom snach‚Äôd by death, his friends bemone,
      He hath liv‚Äôd long. Let every one
      Write Fames sole heire: that‚Äôs free alone,
            From th‚Äô rape of night.




  E Rebus Humanis Excessus.

  _Ode 5. Lib.¬†2._

      _A Departure from things humane._

      _Ode 5. Lib.¬†2._

  Humana linquo: tollite pr√¶petem
  Nubesque ventique. Ut mihi devii
    Montes resedere, & volanti
    Regna porcul, populosque vastos
  Subegit aer! jam radiantia
  Delubra Divum, jam mihi regi√¶
    Turres recessere, & relicta in
    Exiguum tenuantur urbes;
  Totasq; qua se cunque ferunt vaga
  Despecto Gentes. O lacrymabilis
    Jncerta fortuna! √¥ fluent√ªm
    Principia, interit√∫sque rerum!

        Lift me up quickly on your wings,
      Ye Clouds, and Winds; I leave all earthly things;
        How Devious Hills give way to mee!
      And the vast ayre brings under, as I fly,
        Kingdomes and populous states! see how
      The Glyst‚Äôring Temples of the Gods doe bow;
        The glorious Tow‚Äôrs of Princes, and
      Forsaken townes, shrunke into nothing, stand:
        And as I downward looke, I spy
      Whole Nations every where all scattred lye.
        Oh the sad change that Fortune brings!
      The rise and fall of transitory things!

  H√Æc ducta primis oppida m≈ìnibus
  Minantur in C≈ìlum: h√Æc veteres ruunt
    Mur√≠que turresq;: h√Æc supinas
    P√¶n√© cinis sepelivit arces.
  H√Æc mite C≈ìlum, sed rapid√¶ ruunt

        Here walled townes that threatned Heav‚Äôn,
      Now old and ruin‚Äôd, with the earth lye even:
        Here stately Pallaces, that thrust
      Their heads i‚Äôth‚Äôayre, lye buried all in dust.
        Here the Ayre Temp‚Äôrate is and mild,
      But the fierce people rush to warres, most wild:
        Here in a joyfull peace they rest,
      But Direfull Murraines their quiet fields lay wast.

  H√Æc p√¶n√® tellus tota micantibus
  Ardet sub armis: stant acies adhuc
    Pendente fatorum sub ictu,

        Here the whole Land doth scorching lye
      Under the glittering Armes o‚Äô th‚ÄôEnemy:
        Under the hovering stroke o‚Äô th‚Äô Fates
      The Armies yet both stand; and fury waites
        With doubfull steps, upon the warre;
      Fresh courage here, the mingled troopes prepare.
        Each against other fiercely run,
      And mutually they worke destruction:
        The slaughtered heapes in reeking gore
      With bloudy covering spread the fields all o‚Äôre:
        Here on safe Seas, as joyfull prize
      Is strip‚Äôd away th‚Äô√Ügyptian Merchandize,
        Whilst the full Havens thick beset,
      Doe furiously with fierce contention fret.

  Nec una Marti causa, nec unius
  Sunt Arma moris. Bellat Adultera

  Hic verba bellis vindicat: hic canis,
  Heu vile furtum! Se mala comparant;
    Rarum sub exemplo superbit,
    Nec sceleris scelus instar omne est.

        _Mars_ hath his divers Causes, and
      His severall fashion‚Äôd weapons to command.
        From the Adultresse smiling lookes
      Pleasure doth fight, and unto Warre provokes,
        The doting world with _Helen_ burnes.
      This sordid man, oh base advantage! turnes
        Revenge of vvords to blowes;
      Mischiefe begets it selfe, from mischiefe growes.
        Small sins by example higher dare,
      Nor doth all sin, alvvaies like sin appeare.

        The troubled Sea vvith vvinds beset

      The dying people all o‚Äôrewhelmed lye.
        The silent dust remaines, to let
      The weary Pilgrim this Inscription set
        (In after times, at hee goes by)
      _King, Kingdome, People here entombed lye_.
        What should I name the raging Seas,
      Whole Havens over-flowing, and with these

      The shaken Temples of the Gods that found?

  Ad Publium Memmium.

  Od. 7. Lib.¬†2.

  Esset humanis aliquod levamen
  Cladibus, si res caderent e√¢dem
  Qu√¢ mor√¢ surgunt; sed humant repentes
        Alta ruin√¶.
  Nil diu felix stetit; inquieta
  Urbium currunt hominumq; Fata:
  Totq; vix horis jacu√™re, surgunt
        Regna quot annis.
  Casibus longum dedit ille tempus,
  Qui diem regnis satis eruendis
  Dixit: elato populos habent mo-
        menta sub ictu.
  Parce crudeles, moriture _Publi_,
  Impio divos onerare questu,
  Densa vicinis nimi√πm vagari
        Funera tectis.
  Qu√¶ tibi prim√πm dedit hora nasci,
  H√¶c mori prim√πm dedit. Ille long√πm
  Vixit, √¶ternum sibi qui merendo
        Vindicat √¶vum.


      To _Publius Memmius_.

      _Ode 7. Lib.¬†2._

        Amidst our losse it were some ease,
      If things did fall, with the same stay, and leisure
        They rise; but sudden ruines seize
      On our most lofty things, and richest treasure.
        Nothing long time hath happy been.
      The restlesse Fates of peopled-Cities, passe:
        In a few hour‚Äôs destroy‚Äôd w‚Äôhave seen,
      In many yeares what never raised was.
        He gave to Chance long time, that said
      One day‚Äôs enough, whole Kingdomes t‚Äôoverthrow:
        Each moment holds a people swayd
      Under a fatall and exalted blow.
        Being neere thy death, then, _Publius_, spare
      To load the Gods, with thy blasphemous plaints;
        That Funeralls so frequent are,
      Or death so much thy neighbours house haunts.
        The houre, that first to thee gave life,
      That thou should‚Äôst likewise dye, gave first to thee.
        He hath liv‚Äôd long, who well doth strive
      Sure alwaies of eternall life to bee.




  Ad Asterium. Ode 8. lib¬†2.

  At nos inani pascit imagine
  Fortuna rerum. Ludimur _Asteri_,
    Umbris amicorum; & doloso
      Verba simul placu√™re fuco,
  Res esse stulti credimus. at simul
  Sors infidelem corripuit rotam,
    Gaudent recedenti Sodales
      Non eadem dare verba Div√¶.

      To Asterius. _Od 8. l. 2._

      VV‚ÄôAre mock‚Äôd with ‚Äôbaytes that fortune flings
      And fed with th‚Äôempty husks of things:
          Shadowes, not friends we entertaine;
          W‚Äôare pleas‚Äôd with the deceitfull traine
      Of words, and thinke them deeds. But when
      Th‚Äôunconstant wheele shall turne agen
          To th‚Äô parting Goddesse, wee shall see
          Those friends the selfe-same words deny.
      Things Humane under false names please.
      Our gifts match not our promises;
          Religion, lesse to be doth use,
          Then the large language of our vowes.




  Ex sacro Salomonis Epithal.

  Ode 19. l.¬†2.

    Similis est dilectus meus capre√¶, hinnuloque cervorum.

      Out of _Solomon‚Äôs_ sacred Mariage Song.

      _Ode 19. Lib.¬†2._

  Vitas sollicit√¶ me similis capr√¶,
  Quam vel nimbisoni sibilus Africi,
  Vel motum subitis murmur Etesiis
        Vano corripit impetu.
  Nam seu prima metum bruma trementibus
  Incussit foliis, sive Diespiter
  Elisit resonis tela Cerauniis,
        Incert√¢ trepidat fug√¢.
  At qui non ego te qu√¶rere desinam,
  Clamatura retr√≤, _Christe_, Revertere: &
  Rursus, c√πm rapido fugeris impetu,
        Clamatura, Revertere.

      Thou shunnest me, like to a fearfull Roe,
        Which, as the stormy North-winds blow,
      Or the rough noise o‚Äô th‚Äô suddaine Easterne blast,
        Is snatch‚Äôd away with forcelesse hast.
      For th‚Äôearly frost the trembling leaves doth fright,
        Or else the Father of the light
      Hath hewne from th‚Äôecchoing rocks his thundring darts,
        Hee hastens with such doubtfull starts.
      But till I find thee, I‚Äôle not cease, nor rest,
        But cry aloud, Returne, √¥ Christ:
      And when with swifter speed thou fly‚Äôst away,
        Returne againe, √¥ Christ, I‚Äôle say.

  O seu te Libani terga virentia,
  Seu formosa rubr√¶ culta Bethuli√¶,
  Seu pinguis Solym√¶, sive procul cav√¶
        Cingunt rura Capharni√¶;
  Tandem sollicit√¶ pone modum fug√¶.
  Nam non effugies, Te mihi sedulis
  Aether excubiis prodet, & aureis
        Prodet Cynthia cornibus.
  Te neglecta gemunt littora, te procul
  Suspirat tacitis aura Pavoniis,
  Te noctis vigiles, te mihi vividis
        Signant sidera nutibus.

      The tops of _Lebanus_, so green and gay,
        The faire tilths of _Bethulia_,
      Encompasse thee, old _Salem_‚Äôs fruitfull Land,
        Or else _Capharnia_ low doth stand.
      At length give o‚Äôre thy sad and carefull flight:
        Thou shalt not scape me, th‚Äôevening bright
      With its so watchfull Centry, thee‚Äôl betray,
        And th‚ÄôMoone with golden hornes doth stray.
      By th‚Äôgrones of the neglected shores I‚Äôle find
        Thee; and by th‚Äôsighs o‚Äôth‚Äô Westerne wind;
      Thee the night‚Äôs watch, the starrs that walke about
        With lively signes will point thee out.

      _Dir√¶_ in _Herodem_.

      _Ode 24. Lib.¬†2._

  Devota sacr√¶ progenies domus!
  Fatale monstrum! prodigialium
    Monstrum parentum! seu Libyssa
      Marmaricis le√¶ pavit antris,
  Seu te maligno sidere degener
  Pardus marit√¢ tigride prodidit,
    Furoris h√¶redem paterni;
      Sive gregis populator Afri
  Nudum sub alto destituit jugo;
  Seu belluosis fluctibus exspuit
    Irata tempestas nocentem
      Alitibusq; ferisq; pr√¶dam;

      Thou Cursed off-spring of that sacred place!
      Thou fatall monster of prodigious race!
      A Libyan Lyonesse in some Affrick den
      Gave nourishment to thee, thou shame of men.
      Or mungrill Libard with a shee-Tiger, hurl‚Äôd
      Thee, with a mischiefe, into th‚Äôhatefull world,
      Heyre to the fury of thy Syre, and damm;
      Or some wild Wolfe left thee a naked shame:
      Under a huge hard rock: some angry storme,
      From waves, with things so full of divers forme,
      For birds and beasts, spew‚Äôd th‚Äôup a banefull prey;

  Tuo severas pectore marmora
  Dux√™re venas, marmora rupibus
    Decisa, quas G√¶tula c√¶lebs
      Deucalio super arva iecit:
  Te sede primum livida regi√¢
  Meg√¶ra fixit: Tisiphone dedit
    Sceptrum cruentandum feraq;
      Imposuit Diadema fronti; &
  Regale nuper cum premeres ebur
  Adsedit altis fulta curulibus,
    Et per Pal√¶stinos Tyrannis
      Explicuit sua signa campos.

      The Marble quarry, ‚Äômid‚Äôst the raging Sea,
      It‚Äôs rigid veynes, from thy rough bosome drew;
      Marble, from those rocks hewne, _Deucalion_ threw
      Over _G√¶tulian_ fields: _Megara_ first
      Fix‚Äôd th‚Äôin thy regall seat, on thee accurst
      Then _Tisiphon_ the Scepter did bestow,
      And set the Diadem on thy savage brow:
      And as thy princely Ivory, of late
      Thou proudly lean‚Äôdst upon, close by thee sate
      With stately columnes prop‚Äôd, fell tyrannie,
      Her Ensignes, who through _Palestine_ let fly:

  Tremensq; & atrum sanguine √¢ manu
  Telum coruscans secum Odia, & Minas,
    C√¶demque & insanos tumultus,
      Funeraq; & populorum iniquas
  Strages, & indignum excidium retr√≤
  Lactantis √¶vi traxit, & inclyta
    Regnorum, inexhaustasque longis
      Cladibus evacuavit urbies.
  Illam & parentum dira gementium
  Lamenta, Questusque, & Gemitus retr√≤,
    Luctusque vicatim secuti, &
      Irriguis Lacrym√¶ catervis.

      And her black sword with bloudy trembling hand
      Did brandish round, when straight at her command
      Hatreds, and strifes appear‚Äôd, murder and rage
      The horrid ruine of the new-borne age,
      Shee drew along; Tumultuous madness, all
      The slaughter‚Äôd peoples unjust funerall:
      Each famous kingdome, inexhausted towne
      In a large streame of bloud by her, o‚Äôre-throwne.
      Next followed Her, the plaints, and direfull grones
      Of sighing parents, rob‚Äôd of their little ones,
      Whole tydes of teares, sobs, and lamentings great
      And mourning in each corner of the street.

  Qu√≤d si caducis decidit amnibus
  Pr√¶sagus imber, quid pluvias sequi
    Cunctantur ultrices procell√¶,
      Et volucrum strepitu quadrigarum
  Incussus √¶ther pigra tonitrua &
  Immugient√ªm fulmina nubium
    Compescit, indulgentque met√¶
      A√´riis vaga tela pennis?

      But if this show‚Äôr, from this sad cause begun,
      In too too narrow rivulets doth run;
      Why doe revenging stormes so much delay
      To back the rayne? what doth their fury stay?
      Why doth the shaken sky with rustling noise
      Of the Sun‚Äôs chariot, bridle in the voice
      Of the slow thunder? why the lightning stop
      From breaking through the clouds with hideous clap?
      Those ayrie feather‚Äôd arrowes in the darke
      That stray, why do they spare their cursed marke?

  At nil trisulcis Acroceraunia

      _Acroceraunia_ with his three-fork‚Äôd flame.
      And that huge Hill the Thracian Queen gave name,
      _√Ümathia‚Äôs_ craggy trembling rocks may passe
      Guiltlesse; they have not sin‚Äôd at all, alasse!
      Unlesse their Marble, with a prodigious birth,
      This direfull Monster teem‚Äôd, t‚Äôinfest the earth:
      Breake then the mountaines, break yee lightnings,
      Throw headlong downe ye fruitfull rocks of Kings.

  Exspiret auras; occidat, occidat

    Fatale monstrum, dissident√ªm
      Ludibrium Furiarum, & Orci.

      May hee exspire! oh may the murth‚Äôrer fall!
      Most execrable, cruell, tragicall!
      Upon his kingdom‚Äôs pile, and flaming yew
      Let his high carkasse blaze; the ayre anew
      May th‚Äô monster purge from his infectious breath,
      The mocke of wrangling furyes, and of death.

      Devouring waves toss‚Äôd with the worst of weather:

    Somnos ex oculis pollice terserit:
  Donec Lucifer aureus
    Rerum paciferum ruperit otium.

      Molest not my beloved with your cryes,
        Amongst the twining Violets that lyes:
      Doe not with claps of hands, or noise of feet,
        Awake her, from her carefull slumbers yet:
      Untill my Spouse, of her owne selfe, shall rise
        And wipe away the soft sleep, from her eyes;
      Untill the golden day-starre shall release
        All things from silent rest, and gentle peace.

  Summis ecce venit jugis
    Formos√¶ soboles matris, & unica
  Formosi soboles patris:
    Silvarumq; super colla comantium,
  Et intonsum Libani caput,
    Magnorumq; salit terga cacuminum, ac
  Proceras nemorum domos
    Prono transiliens pr√¶terit impetu:
  Veloci similis capr√¶
    Qua visis humili in valle leonibus,
  Per pr√¶rupta, per ardua
    Sublimi volucris fertur anhelitu.

      Behold from tops of yonder hills doth come
        The blessed off-spring of‚Äôs faire mothers womb,
      The only issue of‚Äôs bright father too,
        On the thick tops o‚Äôth‚Äô groves doth leaping goe,
      The unshorne head of _Lebanus_ so hye
        Hee leaps, and the great backs of Mountaines¬†by,
      The stately dwellings of the woods hee skips,
        And down again with nimble foot hee trips:
      Like to a frighted, and swift running Roe.
        Beholding Lions in a vale below,
      With an amazed haste, and deep fetch‚Äôd breath
        Through uncouth places runs t‚Äôescape his death.




  Ad Egnatium Nollium.

  √Üquo semper rectoq; animo, adversus fortun√¶ inconstantiam
  standum esse.

  _Ode 4. Lib.¬†3._

      To _Egnatius Nollius_.

      _That we ought to be of an even and upright mind, against
      the inconstancy of fortune._

      _Ode 4. Lib.¬†3._

  Sive te molli vehet aura vento,
  Sive non planis agitabit undis,
  Vince Fortunam, dubiasque _Nolli_,
        Lude per artes.
  Riserit? vultum generosus aufer.
  Fleverit? dulci refer ora risu:
  Solus, & semper tum esse quovis
        Disce tumultu.
  Ipse te clausus modereris urbem
  Consul aut C√¶sar; quoties minant√ªm
  Turba fatorum quatient serenam
        Pectoris arcem.

      Art thou blow‚Äôn on, with gentle gale,
      Or in rough waters forc‚Äôd to sayle?
      Still conquer Fortune, make but sports
      Of her, and her uncertain Arts.
      Laughs shee? turne bravely away thy face.
      Weeps shee? bring‚Äôt back, with smiling grace:
      When shee‚Äôs most busie, be thou than
      Retyr‚Äôd, and alwayes thine own man.
      Thus close shut up, thine owne free state
      Thou best mayst rule, chiefe Magistrate;
      When the fierce Fates shall most molest,
      The serene palace of thy brest.

  Cum leves visent tua tecta casus,
  L√¶tus occurres: pr√¶eunte luctu
  Faustitas & pax subeunt eosdem
        S√¶pe Penates.
  Dextra sors omnis gerit hoc sinistrum,
  Qu√≤d facit molleis: habet hoc sinistra
  Prosperum, quem nunc ferit, imminenteis
        Durat in ictus.
  Ille qui longus fuit, esse magnus
  Desinit m≈ìror, facilem ferendo
  Finge Fortunam; levis esse longo
        Discit ab usu.

      When light mischance, thy fort, or thee
      Shall visit; meet it merrily:
      Good luck, and peace, in that house stay
      Where mourning, first, hath led the way.
      In dext‚Äôrous chance, this hurt we see,
      It makes us soft: Extremity--
      This, prosperous hath, wheresoe‚Äôre it hits,
      It hardens, and for danger fits.
      The griefe that hath been of such length,
      Doth ‚Äôbate its violence and strength.
      By bearing much, make fortune frees
      Shee learnes, by custome, light to¬†be.




  Ad Marcum Silicernium.

  Veras esse divitias, qu√¶ √† bonis animi petuntur.

  _Ode 6. Lib.¬†3._

  Nunquam pr√¶cipiti credulus ale√¶
  Cum Fatis avidas composui manus,
  Ut mecum taciti f≈ìdere pr√¶lii
        Aequ√¢ pace quiescerent.
  Quid Fortuna ferat crastina, nesciam,
  H√¶res ipse neci. Quas dedit, auferet,
  Non avellet opes, qu√¶ procul extime
        Semot√¶ spatio jacent.
  Qu√¶ possunt adimi, non mea credidi;
  Nunquam pauperior, si mens integer.
  Regnum, _Marce_, mei si ben√® de meis
        Vectigalia censibus--
  Intra me numerem. Pars animi latet
  Ingens, divitibus l√¶tior Indiis,
  Quo non ter spatio longi√πs annuo
        Itur navibus, aut equis.
  Sed mens assiduum visitur in diem
  Hospes s√¶pe sui; non ebur, aut novas
  Mercatura dapes, ipsa sui satis
        Dives, si sibi cernitur.


      To Marcus Silicernius.

      _That those are the true riches which are fetch‚Äôd
      from the goods of the mind._

      _Ode 6. lib.¬†3._

      A rash believer of their ticklish play,
        With Fates, I ne‚Äôre joyn‚Äôd greedy hands in hast.
      From the strict course of private jarres, that they
        With mee, in such an equall peace should rest.
      I know not what to morrow‚Äôs fortune brings
        Heire to my selfe alone. The wealth she gave
      Lyes in my outmost roomes, ‚Äômongst worst of things;
        Which, without force, she may for taking have.
      Things can be ta‚Äône away, I ne‚Äôre thought mine;
        Not poorer I, if mine owne selfe compleat.
      I kingdome, _Marcus_, of my selfe I find
        If the great custome of mine owne estate--
      Within me I could in just numbers cast.
        A great part of my mind lyes close, more wide
      Then the rich Indyes are, to which at most
        But thrice a yeare, we can but sayle or ride.
      But my rich mind, oft to it selfe a guest,
        By its owne selfe is daily visited;
      Not ‚Äôbout to buy Toyes for a roome, or feast,
        If of its selfe it‚Äôs seen, it‚Äôs richly fed.




  _Ad Aurelium Fuscum._

  Omnia humana Caduca, incertaque esse.

  _Ode 12. Lib.¬†3._

  Si primum vacuis demere corticem
  Rebus. _Fusce_, velis, cetera diffluunt
  Vern√¶ more nivis, qu√¶ mod√≤ nubium
        Leni tabuit halitu.
  Formosis reseces fortia; displicent.
  Externis trahimur; si mal√® Dardanis
  Respondens Helen√¶ pectus amoribus
        Famosus videat Paris;
  Nusquam per medii pr√¶lia Nerei
  Ventorumque minas splendida deferat
  Graii furta thori sed ben√® mutuo
        Rerum consuluit jugo
  Natur√¶ Dominus, qu√≤d niveis nigra,
  L√¶tis occuluit tristia. Qui bona
  Rerum de vario deliget agmine,
        Consulto sapiet Deo.


      To _Aurelius Fuscus_.

      _That all humane things are fraile and uncertaine._

      Ode 12. Lib.¬†3.

      If the first barke, _Fuscus_, thou would‚Äôst but pare
          From empty things, the rest will flow,
          And vanish quite like vernal snow;
      Which melts away, with the mild breath o‚Äôth‚Äô ayre.
      Valour from beauty sever‚Äôd, slowly moves.
          Meere outsides please: had _Paris_ seene
          Faire _Helens_ heart, how foule ‚Äôt had beene,
      How ill requiting to the _Trojan_ Loves,
      Ne‚Äôre, through the midst of _Nereus_ broyles, had hee
          Or the winds anger, borne away
          O‚Äôth‚Äô Grecian bed that beauteous prey.
      But Nature‚Äôs Lord, the mutuall yoke, we see,
      Of things hath ord‚Äôred well, that black with white,
          Sad things with joyfull cov‚Äôred lye.
          And from this various mixture, hee
      The best would choose, from Heav‚Äôn must learne the right.




  _Ad C√¶sarem Pausilipium._

  Regnum sapientis.

  _Ode 3. Lib.¬†4._

      To C√¶sar Pausilipius.

      _The kingdome of a wise man._

      _Ode 3. Lib.¬†4._

  Lat√® minaces horruimus Lethi
  Regnare Thracas. Latius imperat,
    Qui solus, exemptusque vulgo
      Certa sui tenet arma voti.
  Imbelle pectus parce fidelibus
  Munire parmis; neu latus aspero
    Lorica cinctu, neu decorum
      Arcus amet pharetraque collum.

      The large-commanding Thracians wee
      Have fear‚Äôd. More large command hath hee,
      Who all alone himselfe retyres,
      And keepes sure guard o‚Äôre his desires.
      Thy unwarlike breast, with shield of proofe
      Forbeare to fortifie; throw off
      From thy unpractic‚Äôd sides the shirt
      Of Mayle, so hard about thee girt.
      Let not the Quiver and the bow
      Such homage to thy soft neck doe.

  An Cimber, an te lectus ab ultimis
  Pictus Britannis ambiat, an Geta,
    Nil allabores; ipse miles,
      Ipse tibi pugil, ipse Ductor.
  Exile regnum, _Pausilipi_, sumus:
  Sed se obsequentem qui sibi subdidit,
    Hic grande fecit, si suasmet
      Ipse roget peragatque leges.

      Whether‚Äôt bee _Dane_, or _Pict_, ta‚Äône out
      From farthest _Brittaine_, hems th‚Äôabout
      Or _Goth_, ne‚Äôre labour much to know
      Thine owne Commander, Champion too.
      Wee are--‚Äôtis true a kingdome small;
      But, _Pausilipius_, hee that shall
      His flatt‚Äôring selfe, t‚Äô himselfe subdue,
      A businesse great doth undergoe;
      If his owne lawes hee can perswade,
      And doth performe them being made,

  Armata Regem non faciet cohors,
  Non tincta vulgi purpura sanguine,
    Aut nobili stellatus auro
      Frontis apex, teretique gemm√¢.
  Rex est, profanos qui domuit metus:
  Qui c√πm stat unus, castra sibi facit;
    Casumq; fortunamque pulchro
      Provocat assiduus duello.

      An host, makes no Kings title good,
      Nor Robes deepe dy‚Äôd in peoples blood.
      A high brow set with starrs of gold,
      Or Jems more glorious to behold.
      Hee who hath tam‚Äôd all coward feares,
      And his owne Guard himselfe prepares,
      Who practic‚Äôd, in faire combate, first
      Dares Chance and Fortune do their worst;

  Non ille vultum fingit ad improbi
  Decreta vulgi, non popularia
    Theatra, non illum troph√¶a,
      Non volucri movet aura plausu.
  Beatus, √† quo non humilem gravis
  Fortuna vocem, non tumidam levis
    Expressit umquam curiosis
      Dum tacitus premit ora fatis.

      That man‚Äôs a King. Hee doth not faine
      His lookes to th‚Äô votes o‚Äôth‚Äô vulgar straine,
      The popular stage, and publike showes
      Ne‚Äôre moves him, nor the ayre that blowes
      With swift applause; Hee‚Äôs blest whose sprite
      Fall Fortune sad, or fall she light,
      Hath ne‚Äôre exprest, to th‚Äôstanders¬†by,
      A low complaint, or haughty cry;
      But, lest the curious Fates displease--
      Hee should, holds modestly his peace.

  Ad prima si quis vulnera non gemit,
  Solo peregit bella silentio:
    Celare qui novit sinistros,
      Ille potest ben√® ferre casus.
  Ille, & caducis se licet undi;
  Suspendat auris pontus, & in caput
    Unius & flammas, & undam, &
      Vertat agens maria omnia Auster,
  Rerum ruinas, mentis ab ardu√†
  Sublimis aul√†, non sine gaudio
    Spectabit, & lat√® ruenti
      Subjiciens sua collo c√¶lo

      At‚Äôs first wounds, who nor grones, nor quakes,
      A Conquest with his silence makes:
      Hee that mischance knowes how to hide,
      The worst of ills, can best abide.
      Hee, though the Sea should every where
      Hang up its waves i‚Äôth‚Äô flitting ayre;
      And the rough winds on him, should presse
      Flames mix‚Äôd with billowes, nay whole Seas,
      From the high Court of‚Äôs lofty mind
      I‚Äôth‚Äô midst o‚Äôth‚Äô ruine, sport can find;
      Sets to his neck to th‚Äô falling skye,

  Mundum decoro vulnere fulciet;
  Interq; c√¶li fragmina, lugubre
    Telluris insistet sepulchrum, ac
      Incolumis morientis √¶vi
  Heres, ab alto prospiciet, magis
  H√¶c magn√¶ quam sint qu√¶ pedibus premit,
    Qu√†m qu√¶ relinquet; jam tum Olympi
      Non dubius moriturus hospes.

      And props the world most valiantly:
      To the now gasping Age safe heyre,
      Leans on the Earth‚Äôs sad sepulchre,
      Whence, ‚Äômidst the fragments of the skye,
      Hee sees most clearly from on hye,
      How much more great those things appeare,
      Hee treads on, then indeed they are,
      Being then prepar‚Äôd, and ready drest
      To dye _Olympus_ certaine guest.

  Qu√≤ c√πm volentem fata reduxerint,
  Nil interest, an morbus, an hosticus
    Impellat ensis, qu√≤ supremum
      Urget itur. Semel advehemur
  Quam navigamus semper in insulam
  Seu lata magnis stravimus √¶quora
    Regis carinis; seu Quirites,
      Exigu√¢ vehimur phaselo.
  Illo beatum margine me meus
  Exponat asser. Cur ego sistere
    Aeterno reformidens quietus
      Littore, si peritura linquam?

      Where, when by th‚Äô Fates hee‚Äôs gladly brought,
      Whether disease, it matter‚Äôs not,
      Or enemies sword, doth thrust him¬†on,
      When his last journey he must run.
      To th‚Äô Port wee are but once brought in
      To which w‚Äôhave alwayes sayling bin:
      Whether, as mighty Princes, wee
      In gallant ships have spread the Sea;
      Or, as the common sort of men,
      In smaller Barks, have carryed been.
      May my poore bottome to that brinke
      Mee happy bring; why should I shrinke--
      Safe on th‚ÄôAeternall shore to stand,
      If with such trash I can shake hand?




  _Ad Q. Delliam._

  Non tam populari exemplo, qu√¢m potius rationis ductu
  vitam esse instituendam.

  _Ode 10. Lib.¬†4._

      To Q. Dellius.

      _That our life ought not to bee instituted so much by
      popular example, as by the guiding of reason._

      _Ode 10. Lib.¬†4._

  Delli, si populo duce
    Vita degenerem carpimus orbitam,
  Erramus, procul arduis
    Virtus se nimium seposuit jugis.
  Illuc qu√≤ via tritior,
    Hoc est certa min√πs. Longus inutili
  Error nectitur ordine:
    Et mores populum, non ratio trahit.

      Wee erre (my _Dellius_) if wee take
        That baser path of life, the people make;
      In highest and remotest Hills
        Vertue sequesters up her selfe, and dwells.
      There where the way more beaten lyes,
        Lesse certaine, and more slipp‚Äôry alwayes ‚Äôtis.
      From fruitlesse order, errours grow;
        Custome, not reason, drawes the people now.

  Casu vivitur, & viam
    Non metam premimus, qu√† pr√¶euntium
  Per vestigia civium
    Insan√¶ strepitus plebis, & improb√¶
  Voces invidi√¶ vocant.
    Exemplis trahimur & trahimus retr√≤,
  Soli nemo sibi est malus,
    Nulli vita sua est: dum vaga postero
  Tubam turba premit gradu,
    Sunt primi exitio s√¶p√® sequentibus.

      Men live by Chance, our time we spend
        I‚Äôth‚Äô way, like Truants, and forget the end,
      Where ‚Äômid‚Äôst the throng of passers¬†by,
        The noyse of the mad rout, the hatefull cry
      Of envy, calls, wee‚Äôre drawne amaine
        B‚Äôexample; others wee draw back againe;
      No man is ill to himselfe alone,
        Nor no mans life is onely call‚Äôd his owne.
      Whil‚Äôst that the rambling rout treads o‚Äôre
        With after steps, the heeles of them before,
      They that goe formost are design‚Äôd
        A mischiefe oft to those that come behind.

  Me Parnassus & integer
    Plebeiis Helicon c√¶tibus eripit
  Sublimem; und√® vagantium
    Errores animorum, & mal√® desidis
  Vulgi damna patent. juvat
    Ex alto intrepidum colle jacenti√†
  Despectare pericula, &
    Cantum non propriis vivere casibus.

      _Pernassus_, and chaste _Helicon_
        Sublimes and takes mee from the vulgar throng:
      From whence, the false mistakes I view
        And wandring mindes of the too slothfull crew;
      And from on hye I fearelesse see,
        With sport, the dangers that below me lye;
      Thus warily with joy I live,
        And by, other mens mischances I can thrive.




  _Ad Sigismundum L√¶tum._

  Glori√¶ inanis despicientiam & silentium commendat.

  Ode 11. l.¬†4.

      To Sigismundus L√¶tus.

      _Hee Commends the despising of vaine-glory, and silence._

      Od. 11. Lib.¬†4.

  L√¶te, quid cassis sequimur fugacem
  Gloriam telis? fugit illa Mauri
  More, vel Parthi, regeritque ab ipso
        Vulnera tergo.
  Hospes unius negat esse tecti
  Garrulus vulgi favor: h√Æc inani
  Aure rumores legit, inde veris
        Falsa remiscet.

      Why fleeting glory follow wee,
        _L√¶tus_, with weapons all in vaine?
      When like a Moore, or Parthian, shee
        Flyes at her backe with wounded Trayne.
      The Talking-peoples love, denyes
        Under one roofe a guest to fix:
      With‚Äôs empty care, one takes up lyes,
        And them with truths, doth subt‚Äôly mix,

  H√Æc velut nidum positurus h√¶sit,
  Mox ubi vano vacuum tumultu
  Pectus illusit, tacitis in altum
        Subsilit alis,
  Vera laus sciri fugit. ipse pulcher
  Se su√¢ Titan prohibet videri
  Luce: qui totus potuit latere,
        Major habetur.

      Another sticks, and thinkes to build
        His nest: but when he plainly sees
      His empty breast with noise beguild,
        Aloft with silent wings, hee flees.
      True praise would not be knowne; the Sun
        Forbids from being seen below
      By his own light: and hee that can
        Ecclipse himselfe, doth brighter show.

  Qui premit sacram taciturnitate
  Pectoris gazam; ben√® non silenti
  Tutus in vulgo ben√® suspicaci
        Regnat in aul√¢.
  Pr√¶terit mutas ben√® cymba ripas;
  Qu√¶ simul raucis strepu√™re saxis,
  In latus cautam sapiens memento
        Avertere proram.

      Hee that in silence, of his mind
        The sacred Treasury containes;
      Safety i‚Äôth‚Äô vulgar noyse doth find:
        In‚Äôs doubtfull Court, and wisely raignes.
      Still banks thy Pinnace well may passe.
        But when with hoarse rocks they do roare,
      Remember wisely to forecast
        And turn‚Äôt aside with wary Oare.




  _Ad Ianum Libinium._

  Solitudinem suam excusat.

  _Ode 12. Lib¬†4._

      To Ianus Libinius.

      _Hee excuses his retyrednesse._

      _Ode 12. Lib.¬†4._

  Quid me latentem sub tenui lare
  Dudum moretur, c√πm mihi civium
    Amica certatim patescant
      Atria, s√¶pe rogas _Libini_.
  Me plenus, extra quid cupiam? meo
  In memet ipsum clausus ab ostio,
    In se recedentis reviso
      Scenam animi vacuumq; relustro
  Vit√¶ theatrum, sollicitus mei
  Spectator, an qu√¶ fabula prodii
    Matura procedam, & supremo
      Numinis excipienda plausu.
  Omnes recenset numen, & approbat
  Vel culpat actus: quo mea judice
    Si scena non lev√® peracta est,
      Sim populo sine teste felix.

      What ‚Äôtis detaines me here, and why--
      I hide my selfe from every eye.
      How in so poore a house I spend
      My houres, y‚Äôhave often ask‚Äôd me, friend;
      When the free Courts of free-borne men,
      Fall out, which first shall let me¬†in.
      I enjoy my selfe, what need I more?
      Of every sense I lock the dore;
      And close shut up, a taske I find
      In the retyring house o‚Äôth‚Äô mind:
      The Theatre of my life I view
      My owne spectator and iudge too--
      Whether the tale I first begun
      In well digested Acts I‚Äôue spun;
      In every scene, if every clause
      Goes neatly off, with heav‚Äôns applause:
      Each Action scan‚Äôd, is there set free
      Or sentenc‚Äôd by authoritie--
      If there, with _well Done_ I escape,
      I‚Äôme blest without the peoples clap.

  Odi loquacis compita glori√¶
  Plebeia: quam c√πm fama faventibus
    Evexit auris, s√¶pe misso
      Invidi√¶ stimulata telo,
  Aut invident√ªm territa vocibus,
  Par√πm obstinatis & mal√® fortibus
    Dimittit alis. Illa nudam
      Plangit humum, lacerosq; saxis
  Affligit artus. Me meli√πs tegat
  Privata virtus, & popularia

  Semota laudem si meruit, vetat
  Audire virtus. tuti√πs invidi
    Longinqua miramur: propinquis

      I hate the common road of praise,
      Or what the gaping vulgar raise,
      Which with a pleasant gale a while
      Fame hurries, but doth soone beguile:
      Now Envie‚Äôs sting it feeles, ere long
      Th‚ÄôArtillery of some spightfull tongue:
      Thus chac‚Äôd, with weak‚Äôned wings it dyes;
      Or torne, on the bare ground it lyes.
      A private fame, a meane house, where
      I live conceal‚Äôd from popular ayre,
      Best fits my mind, and shelters¬†me:
      Vertue t‚Äôher owne praise deafe should¬†be.
      Our emulation, things a farre off command,
      But Envy haunts things that are neere at hand.




  _Ad C√¶sarem Pausilippium._

  Adversa constanti animo ferenda esse.

  _Ode 13. Lib.¬†4._

  Si qu√¶ flent mala lugubres
    Auferrent oculi, Sidoniisego
  Mercarer ben√® lacrymas
    Gemmis, aut teretum merce monilium,
  At ceu rore seges viret,
    Sic crescunt riguis tristia fletibus.
  Urget lacryma lacrymam;
    Fecundusq; sui se numerat Dolor.
  Quem fortuna semel virum
    Udo degenerem lumine viderit,
  Illum s√¶p√® ferit; mala
    Terrentur tacito fat√¶ silentio.
  Ne te, ne tua fleveris
    Qu√¶ tu, care, vocas, _Pausilipi_, mala,
  Quam pellunt lacrym√¶, fovent
    Sortem: dura negant cedere mollibus.
  Siccas si videat genas,
    Dur√¶ cedet hebes sors patienti√¶.


      To C√¶sar Pausilippius.

      _That adversity is to bee endured with a constant mind._

      Ode 13. l.¬†4.

      If mournfull eyes could but prevent
      The evils they so much lament
      Sidonian Pearles, or Gems more rare,
      Would be too cheap for ev‚Äôry teare.
      But moyst‚Äôned woes grow fresh, and new,
      As Come besprinkled with the dew.
      Teare followes teare, and fruitfull griefe
      Hath from it selfe, its owne reliefe.
      The man whom Fortune doth espy
      With drooping spirit, and moyst‚Äôned eye,
      Shee, often strikes; ill Fate, amaine
      Runs Scarr‚Äôd no notice being ta‚Äône.
      Bewayle not then thy selfe, deare friend,
      Or evills that on thee attend;
      What they expell, teares cherish oft;
      Hard things deny to yeild to soft.
      Mischance is conquered, when she spies
      A valiant patience with dry eyes.




  _Ad Crispum L√¶vinium._

  Rogatus cur s√¶p√® per viam caneret, respondet.

  _Ode 44. Lib¬†4._

      To Crispus L√¶vinius.

      _Being asked why hee sung so often as hee travailed,
      hee answers._

      _Ode 44. Lib.¬†4._

  Cum meam nullis humeros onustus
  Sarcinis tecum patriam reviso
  L√¶tus, & parvo mihi cumque dives
        Canto viator.
  Tu siles m≈ìst√πm: tibi cura Musas
  Demit, & multi grave pondus auri.
  Qu√¶que te quondam male fida rerum
        Turba relinquet.
  Dives est qui nil habet; illa tant√πm
  Qu√¶ potest cert√¢ retinere dextr√¢,
  Seque fert secum vaga qu√≤, migrare
        Jussit egestas.

      As cheerefully I walke with thee,
      My shoulders from all burdens free.
      Our native soyle again to see
            Rich to my selfe I sing,
      Whil‚Äôst care strikes thee, and thy Muse dumb,
      The heavy weight of thy vast summe,
      Or what estate in time to come
            The faithlesse rout may bring.
      Hee‚Äôs rich that nothing hath; Hee that
      In‚Äôs certaine hand holds his estate,
      That makes himselfe his constant mate
            Where need commands him¬†go;

  Quid mihi, qui nil cupiam, deesse
  Possit? umbro si placet una _Pindi_
  Vallis: √¥ sacrum nemus, √¥ jocosa
        Rura Cam≈ìna!
  Qu√¶ meos poscet via cunq; gressus,
  Delphici mecum, mea regna, colles
  Itis, & fessum comitante circum-

  Me Gothus s√¶vis religet catenis,
  Me Scythes captum rapiat; solut√¢
  Mente, vobiscum potero tremendos
        Visere Reges.

      What can I want, that nought desire?
      Then _Pindus_ vale, I reach no higher:
      O sacred Grove! O pleasant quire
            In those coole shades below!
      What paths soe‚Äôre my steps invite
      Ye Delphian hills, my sole delight
      Doe goe with mee; in weary plight,
            And veyle me with good grace.
      Let th‚Äô_Goth_ his strongest chaines prepare,
      The _Scythian_ hence mee captive teare,
      My mind being free with you, I‚Äôle stare
            The Tyrants in the face.




  _Ad Munatium._

  Nihil in rebus humanis non t√¶dio plenum esse.

  _Ode 15. Lib.¬†4._

      To Munatius.

      _That nothing in humane affaires is not full of tediousnesse._

      Ode 15. l.¬†4.

  Nil est, _Munati_, nil, iter√πm canam,
  Mortale, nil est, immedicabilis
    Immune t√¶d√Æ. Clarus olim
      Sol proavis atavisque nobis,
  Par√πm salubris, nec macul√¢ reus
  Damnatur un√¢; quicquid in arduo
    Immortale mortales _Olympo_
      Vidimus, invidi√¶ caduc√¢
  Fuscamus umbr√¢. non placet incolis
  Qui Sol avitis exoritur jugis;
    Aut prisca qu√¶ dudum paternam
      Luna ferit radiis fenestram.

      Nothing _Munatius_, nothing I sing‚Äôt againe,
      That‚Äôs mortall, nothing from th‚Äôuncured paine
          Of tediousnesse is free. The Sun
          Which bright to our forefathers shone
      To us, but little healthfull, doth appeare,
      And though not guilty of one spott, not cleare:
          Whatsoe‚Äôre immortall thing we see
          In high _Olympus_, silly wee
      Doe over-cast with Envy‚Äôs shade; here one
      From his owne native Hills the rising Sun.
          Disclaimes; or th‚Äôancient Moone, that strikes
          Her beames through‚Äôs fathers glasse, dislikes.

  C√¶lo quotannis, & patriis leves
  Migramus arvis; hunc tepid√¶ vocant
    Brum√¶ Batavorum, huic aprici
      Ausoni√¶ placu√™re soles.
  Frustr√†; fideles si dominum retr√≤
  Morbi sequuntur, nec tacitus Dolor
    Absistit, aut Veiente curru,
      Aut Venet√¢ comes ire cymb√¢.

      Each yeare we change our ayre, and soyle, so light;
      Him, _Hollands_ warmer Climate doth invite:
          Another differs, and doth cry
          _Ausonia_‚Äôs clearer Suns please mee.
      In vaine all this, if faithfull sicknesses
      Wait close behind; if secret griefes ne‚Äôre cease,
          All‚Äôs one, whether in Chariot
          Thou goest, or in Venetian boat.

  Tandemque nobis exulibus placent
  Relicta; certam cui posuit domum
    Virtus, huic nunquam patern√¶
      Fumus erit lacrymosus aul√¶.
  Virtus agresti dives in otio
  Sese ipsa claudit finibus in suis
    Plerumque, & insonti quietum
      In pale√¢ solium reclinat.

      Poore exiles! then, things left doe please us most,
      Who a sure building can from vertue boast,
          To him the smoke of‚Äôs father‚Äôs Hall
          Doth never hurt his eyes at all.
      Vertue oft-times, rich in a rustick ease
      Confines her selfe to her owne private blisse;
          And in the guiltlesse straw, her throne
          With great delight can leane upon.

    _Indica mihi quem diligit anima mea, ubi pascas,
    ubi cubes in meridie._

  Ode 19. Lib.¬†4.

  Dicebas abiens: Sponsa vale; simul
  Vicisti liquidis nubila passibus.
    Longam ducis, Jesu,
      In desideriis moram.
  Ardet iam medio summa dies polo,
  Jam parcit segeti messor, & algidas
    Pastor cum grege valleis,
      Et picta volucres petunt.
  At te qu√¶ tacitis destinet otiis
  O Jesu regio? quis mihi te locus
    C√¶cis invidet umbris,
      Aut spiss√¢ nemorum coma?
  Scirem quo jaceas cespite languidus,
  Quis ventus gracili pr√¶flet anhelitu,
    Quis rivus tibi grato
      Somnum pr√¶tereat sono;
  Ah! n√® te nimio murmure suscitent
  Nostr√¶ diluerent flumina lacrym√¶,
    Et suspiria crudis
      Miscerentur Etesiis.

      Od. 19. Lib.¬†4.

      Thou said‚Äôst, farewell my Spouse, & went‚Äôst away
      More fleet then Clouds with liquid paces stray:
        Oh what a longing, Jesu thus
          With thy delay thou mak‚Äôst in¬†us?
      ‚ÄôTis now high noone, the scorching Sun doth burne
      I‚Äôth‚Äô mid‚Äôst o‚Äôth‚Äô pole, the mower spares the corne,
        The Shepheard, with his flocks, is glad--
          And painted birds, to seeke coole shade.
      But Jesu! where art thou? what region‚Äôs blest
      By holding thee so long in silent rest?
        What darksome shade denyes my love?
          Or with thick boughs what shady Grove?
      Knew I on what green Turfe thou dost repose
      Thy fainting limbs; what wind with soft breath blowes‚Äô
        What streame, with bubling, passing by
          Disturbs thy sleep, or wakens thee;
      Oh! lest the too much noise should raise thee, I
      Would let fall streams of teares should qualifie;
        My warmer sighes thou mix‚Äôd should‚Äôst find
          With the cold blasts o‚Äôth‚ÄôEasterne wind.




  _Ex sacro Salomonis Epithalamio._

  _Ode 21. Lib.¬†4._

      Out of _Salomon_‚Äôs sacred marriage song.

        _My beloved spake and said unto mee, rise up my love,
        my Dove, my faire one, and come away; for loe the winter
        is past, the raine is over and gone: the flowers appeare
        on the earth, the time of singing of birds is come,
        and the voice of the Turtle is heard in our Land.
        The fig tree putteth forth, &c._

      _Ode 21. Lib.¬†4._

  Fallor? an Elysii l√¶v√¢ de parte Sereni
      Me mea vita vocat!
  Surge soror, pulchris innectito lora columbis;
      Pulchrior ipsa super
  Scande rotas, Libaniq; levem de vertice currum,
      Has, age flecte domos.
  Ad tua decidu fugiunt vestigia nimbi,
      Turbidus imber abi√Æt:
  Ipsa sub innocuis mitescunt fulmina plantis,
      Ipsa virescit hiems.

      Do I mistake? or from Elyzium cleare
          My life‚Äôs call doe I heare?
      Sister arise, and harnesse thy sweet paire
          Of Doves, thy selfe more faire;
      Mount and drive hither, here let thy Chariot stop,
          From _Libanus_ hye top;
      At thy approach the falling showres doe fly,
          Tempestuous stormes passe¬†by,
      The lightning‚Äôs quench‚Äôd under thy harmlesse feet,
          Winter turnes Spring to see‚Äôt.

  Interea sacris aperit se scena viretis

  Altera floret humus, alterq; vagantia l√¶tus
      Sidera pascit ager.
  Hic etiam trepidi pendent √® rupibus h√¶di,
      Pr√¶cipitesq; capr√¶;
  Hinnuleique suis, passim dum flumina tranant,
      Luxuriantur aquis.

      While in the sacred Green, a bow‚Äôre we see
          Doth spread it selfe for thee.
      The Earth new Turff‚Äôs it selfe for thee to tread,
          The straying starrs fresh fields make glad.
      Here with their dams, of Kids th‚Äôamazed flocks
          Hang on steep sides of Rocks;
      Here as they swim, the wanton Hinds do play
          In the coole streames all day.

  It Leo cum Pardo viridis de colle Saniri
      Mitis uterque regi,
  Cumque suo passim ludunt in montibus agno
      Exsuperantque juga.
  Plurimus hos circum tacito pede labitur amnis,
      Pumicibusque cavis
  Per violas laps√¶ per declives hyacinthos,
      Exspatiantur aqu√¶.

      The Lion with the Libard downe is l‚Äôed
          Tame and well governed;
      Each with his Lamb about the Mountaines skip,
          O‚Äôre Hills they lightly trip.
      By these a spacious brooke doth slowly glide,
          Which with a spreading tyde
      Through bending Lilyes, banks of Violets
          From th‚Äôhollow Pumice sweats.

  Len√® fluunt rivi, muscosis len√® susurrus
      Murmurat √® scopulis.
  In vitrio pisces saliunt hilares crystallo,
      Dulc√® queruntur aves.
  Nec ver√≤, si m≈ìsta placent saletia c√¶lo
      Flebile murmur abest:
  Nam sibi dum vestro regemunt ex orbe palumbes,
      Huc sonus ille venit.
  Sic dum se viduo solatur Carmine turtur,
      Gaudia nostra placent.

      The rivers gently flow, and a still sound
          From mossie Rocks doth bound.
      The sporting fish dance in the christall Mayne,
          The Birds sweetly complaine,
      The ayre, if dolefull comforts please, doth ring
          With mournfull murmuring.
      For when the Doves eccho each others cry
          That sound doth hither fly.
      As they with widowed notes themselves do please,
          Just so, our joyes increase.

  Cetera non desunt, pronis vindemia pendet

  H√Æc etiam vulg√≤ violas, albentia vulg√≥

  Ipsa tibi, leti succos oblita priores,

  Ips√¶ matur√¢ labentur ab arbore ficus,
      Percutientq; sinum.
  Intere√† falcem vindemia nescit, aratrum
      Saucia nescit humus.
  Ips√¶ sponte virent segetes, innoxius ipse
      Messibus albet ager.
  Pr√¶bent Hospitium platani: pr√¶bet formosos
      Graminis herba toros.

      No want appeares; th‚Äôofficious Vine doth stand
          With bending clusters to our hand.
      Here, thou shalt pick sweet Violets, and there
          Fresh Lillyes all the yeare:
      The Apple ripe drops from its stalke to thee,
          From tast of death made free.
      The luscious fruit from the full Figtree shall
          Into thy bosome fall.
      Meane while, the Vine no pruning knife doth know,
          The wounded earth no plow.
      The Corne growes green alone, and th‚Äôunhurt land
          Doth white with harvest stand.
      The grasse affords a stately bed, the Plane
          Spreads thee to entertaine.

  C√¶dua P√£ch√¶os sudant opobalsama nimbos;
      Et genialis odor
  Aspirat quoties, nutantibus hinc atque illinc
      Ingruit aura comit.
  Surge; quid indignos ducis per t√¶dia soles?
      Surge, age, cara soror.
  Ecce tuis ips√¶ iam circum fr√¶na columb√¶
      Ingemu√™re moris.
  Huc age, formosas formosior ipsa columbas
      Hospita flecte furor.

      Arabian mists sweat from the gummy tree
          Of Balme, and all for thee;
      Which through the ayre, a rich perfume doe throw,
          Fann‚Äôd with each neighb‚Äôring bough.
      Arise my Sister deare, why dost thou stay,
          And spend th‚Äôunwilling day?
      Behold thy harness‚Äôd Doves, at thy delay
          Doe sigh, come, drive away.
      Put on, and hither drive thy beauteous paire
          Of Doves, thy selfe more faire.

  Si tibi pollicitum numen, si fata fuissent

  Quem Pietas quem non moveat non tristibus unquam

       What though the Gods have promis‚Äôd she shall bee
          Enfranchis‚Äôd to Eternity?
      Yet (valiant Sir) so great a losse still cryes
          For a just tribute from your eyes;
      View but her pious mind, that tow‚Äôre of state
          Not shaken by sad stownes of Fate,
      Her humble innocent soule, her guiltlesse feare,
          Her modesty chiefe Regent there;
      The prudent thrift of her presaging mind
          Her constant zeale, pure and refin‚Äôd;
      _And who can then forbeare t‚Äôembalme her Hearse_
          _With the daily precious dew of teares?_

  Provida sed longam magnis virtutibus √¶vum

      Tis not in Fate to promise length of dayes,
          To things of such esteeme and praise;
      Nor can the starrs suffer so ripe a birth
          To be long sullied with dull earth.
      Load not the Heavens then with unjust complaints,
          For taking back one of their Saints.
      The courage of her richly temp‚Äôred breast
          Made her for them a fitter guest:
      Such jewells of her mind sparkle about her
          The starres themselves can‚Äôt shine without her.

      Thus _Tanaquil_; thus _Claudia_‚Äôs virgin band
          Steer‚Äôd the unwilling Barke to land.
      Thus shee, that durst her Husbands fate abide,
          And _Cloelia_ over _Tiber‚Äôs_ tyde;
      Too early crop‚Äôd, survive in Poesie,
          And keepe perpetuall jubilie.
      ‚ÄôTis not in Art to fetch her back againe,
          Or charme the spirits with _Orpheus_ straine,
      To breake the bars of Adamant or scale
          The Rampiers of th‚ÄôElysian wall,

  Errantem campo in magno, quem gemmea circum

          Which may befriend the covetous eye;
      Through these to th‚Äôhidden mysteries I peep,
          And (if the spirits nor dream, nor sleep)
      I saw, or else me thoughts, I there had seene
          Her, wandring o‚Äôre a Spacious Greene,
      With walls of Diamond, gates of purest glasse,
          No Chrystall more transparent was:
      Each blade of grasse was gold, each tree was there,
          A golden Periwig did weare.
      The swelling banks of Violets did curle
          Themselves with Gems, and Orient Pearle;
      The glorious nothing, of the _Trigon_ glasse--
          And all _Apelles_ Art, which passe.

      Her and her tender darling, then I spy,
          I‚Äôth‚Äô mid‚Äôst of that blest company;
      With looks more fresh and sweet, then are the Roses
          Of which her Garlands shee composes--
      Two flowry Chaplets, which with Gems set round
          Her owne and Nephew‚Äôs temples crown‚Äôd.
      But here a veyle was drawne, I must not prie
          Nor search too farre with mortall eye,
      Nor would you more. It may suffice that shee
          Hath chang‚Äôd fraile flesh for blest Eternitie.




  _Ad Albertum Turscium._

  De suis somniis & lyricis.

  _Ode 32. Lib.¬†4._

      To _Albertus Turscius_.

      _Of his Dreames, and Lyricks._

      _Ode 32. Lib.¬†4._

  _Tursci_, seu brevior mihi
      Seu pernox oculos composuit sopor,
  Pennas Somnia l√¶vibus
      Affigunt humeris; jamque virentia
  Latus prata superuolo,
      Qu√† se cumque novum moll√® tumentibus
  Campis explicuit nemus,
      Herbos√¶que patet scena superbi√¶:
  Mox & nubibus altior,
      Mistus flumineis ales oloribus;
  Vivos despicio lacus,
      Et dulci volucrem carmine mentior.

      VVhether a shorter sleep, or whether
        A long one (_Turscius_) joyns mine eyes together
      In my soft dreames, me thinks, I see
        To my light shoulders wings set on, and I
      With joy transported, upward soare,
        The flowry Meddowes, and the pastures o‚Äôre;
      Where the greene Grove its coole shade yeilds
        To th‚Äôstately grasse plotts, and ripe swelling fields:
      Straight, ‚Äômid‚Äôst the river Swans, up hyer
        A winged fowle above the cloudes I‚Äôaspire;
      The lively Lakes below, I sleight,
        And with sweet straines a bird I counterfeit.

  Jam tunc nubila, jam mihi
      Blandis dissiliunt fulmina cantibus;
  Et qu√¶ plurima circuit
      Collum, punice√¢ vincior Iride.
  Idem jam vigil, & meus,
      Non ingrata simul somnia dispuli,
  C√πm ter mobilibus lyram
      Percussi digitis, immemor & ducis
  Nil sectator Horatii,
      Sublimis liquidum nitor in a√´ra;
  Et nunc littera, nunc vagas
      Siccis trajiciens passibus insulas,
  Nil mortale mei gero, &
      Jam nil sollicito debeo ponderi.

      See, now me thinkes, the cloudes in throngs
        The lightning leaps too, at my ravishing songs;
      _Iris_ about my neck hangs round,
        And with her divers colour‚Äôd bow, I‚Äôme bound.
      Being now my selfe, and newly wak‚Äôd,
        My not unwelcome dreames, just now off shak‚Äôd;
      Thrice o‚Äôre my Lute, I scarce had run
        With nible finger neat division;
      Remembring _Horace_, Thee, my guide,
        When my high Genius through th‚Äôayre doth ride;
      Now o‚Äôre the scatt‚Äôred Islands, then
        O‚Äôre Seas, with dry feet passing back again;
      Nothing that‚Äôs mortall of mee, now
        I beare, and nought to my dull bulke I owe.

  _Tursci_, s√¶p√® tamen mones
      Olim ne veteri clarior Icaro
  Veris fabula casibus
      Mutem Parrhasii nomina Balthiri.
  Frustra; nam memor Icari,
      Addo stultiti√¶ consilium brevi:
  Nam, seu dormio, me torus;
      Seu scribo, stabili sella tenet situ.

      Yet _Turscius_ thou hast often told,
        And warn‚Äôd mee, lest then _Icarus_ of old
      By a true fall indeed, I make
        A lowder tale, and change the name o‚Äôth‚ÄôLake.
      In vaine: Remembring Him, I had
        A care, and counsell, to my folly, add:
      For when I sleep, in bed I lye,
        And if I write, my secure chaire holds mee.




  Ad Quintum Tiberinum.

  Ode 34. Lib.¬†4.

  Divitem numquam, _Tiberine_, dices,
  Cuius Eois potiora glebis
  Rura, fortun√¶ sine f√¶ce pulcher
        Rivus inaurat;
  Quem per insigneis geniale ceras
  Stemma claravit; vaga quem per urbes
  Quem per & gentes radiante vexit
        Gloria curru.
  Pauper est, qui se caret; & superb√®
  Ipse se librans, sua rura latam
  Addit in lancem, socioq; fallens
        Pondus in auro,
  Ceteris parvus, sibi magnus uni,
  Ipse se nescit, pretioque falsa
  Plebis attollit, propriaq; se mi-
        ratur in umbr√¢.
  Splendidam ver√¢ sine luce gazam,
  Turgidum plen√¢ sine laude nomen
  Mitte; te solo, _Tiberine_, disces
        Esse beatus.


      To _Quintus Tiberinus_.

      _Ode 34. Lib.¬†4._

      Thou shalt not _Tiberinus_, call
      Him rich, whose every Acre shall
      Outvie the Easterne glebe, whose field
      Faire Fortune‚Äôs clearest streame doth gild.
      Nor him, whose birth, and pedigree
      Is fam‚Äôd abroad by‚Äôs Heraldrie;
      Hee who by fleeting glory‚Äôs hurld
      In his rich Chariot through the world:
      He‚Äôs poore that wants himselfe, yet weighs
      Proudly himselfe; in this scale layes
      His lands, in th‚Äôother broad one,¬†by,
      The false weight of his gold doth lye,
      Great to himselfe, to others small,
      That never knowes himselfe at all,
      As the false people raise him higher,
      Himselfe in‚Äôs shadow hee‚Äôl admire.
      The fairest Gemme without true light,
      Without true praise great titles, flight:
      Blest _Tiberinus_, and most free
      In thy selfe alone thoul‚Äôt learne to bee.




  Ad Paulum Coslovium.

  _Ode 35. Lib.¬†4._

      To _Paulus Coslovius_.

      _Ode 35. Lib.¬†4._

  Iam pridem tepido veris anhelitu
  Afflarunt reduces arva Favonii;
    Jam se florida vernis
      Pingunt prata coloribus:
  Stratus frugiferis Vilia puppibus
  Grato pr√¶ter abit rura silentio,
    Quamvis proximus omni
      Collis personet alite;
  Quamvis & viridi pastor ab aggere
  Dicat gramine√¢ carmina fistul√¢.
    Et qui navita debet
      Plenis otia carbasis.

      The Westerne winds, with the warm breath o‚Äôth‚ÄôSpring,
      Returne, and o‚Äôre our fields their soft gales fling;
        The flowry-garnish‚Äôd Meadowes¬†by,
          With freshest colours painted lye.
      The River, which the gainfull ships so throng,
      With welcome silence gently glides along,
        Although the neighbouring Hill doth ring
          With the shrill notes of birds that sing;
      Although the Swaine, on the green bank that sits
      Old Sonnets with his Oaten Pipe repeats,
        Although the Seaman doth not faile
          At length to strike his full blowne sayle.

  √Üquat Palladiis, _Paulle_, laboribus
  Interpone vices. Cras simul aureo
    Sol arriserit ore
      Summorum juga montium,
  Scandemus viridis terga Luciscii,
  Qu√† cels√¢ tegitur plurimus ilice,
    Et se pr√¶tereunt√ªm
      Audit murmura fontium.
  Illinc √® medio tota videbitur
  Nobis Vilna jugo; tota videbitur
    Qu√¶ Vilnam sinuosis
      Ambit Vilia flexibus.

      To thy _Palladian_ labours interpose
      Such changes _Paullus_; when the Sun forth showes
        And with his golden presence smiles
          On the hye tops of highest Hills,
      Wee‚Äôl mount the back of green _Luciscus_, where
      Hee‚Äôs thickest set with tallest Okes, and heare
        The bubbling noise of streames that flow
          From Fountaines that close by him goe.
      Thence from the midst o‚Äôth‚Äôhill all _Vilna_ shall
      Our prospect be; our eye shall lower fall--
        On _Vilia_‚Äôs cooler streames, that wind,
          And with embraces _Vilna_ bind.

  Illinc picta procul qu√¶ radiantibus
  Fulgent fana tholis, & geminam super
    Despectabimus arcem,
      Magni regna Pal√¶monis.
  Ut longo faciles Pacis in otio
  Se tollunt populi! nam tria tertio
    Surrex√™re sub anno
      Priscis templa Quiritibus;
  Et qu√† conspicuis se Gediminia
  Jactant saxa jugis, & Capitolium,
    Et qu√¶ tecta superbis
      Intrant nubila turribus.

      From thence, farre off, the Temples wee‚Äôl behold,
      And radiant Scutcheons all adorn‚Äôd with gold;
        Then wee‚Äôl looke o‚Äôre that double towre,
          Th‚Äôextent of great _Pal√¶mon_‚Äôs pow‚Äôre.
      How in a settled peace, and kingdomes rest
      The easie people raise themselves, so blest!
        Three Temples in three yeares w‚Äôhave seen
          To th‚ÄôCitizens have reared been;
      Where _Gediminian_ Rocks themselves extoll
      With their plaine tops, and then the Capitol,
        Those buildings, whose proud turrets stretch
          Themselves to th‚ÄôCloudes, and stars doe reach:

  Auget magna, Quies: exiguus labor
  In majus modico provenit otio.
    Hinc & terga virent√ªm
      Lat√® prospice collium.
  Qu√¶ nunc mobilibus nutat Etesiis,
  Segni cana stetit sub nive populus:
    Qui nunc defluit, alt√†
      H√¶sit sub glacie latex:
  Qui nunc purpureis floret ager rosis,
  Immoto sterilis delituit gelu:
    Verno qu√¶ strepit ales,
      Hiberno tacuit die.
  Erg√≤ rumpe moras, & solidum grav√Æ
  Cur√¶ deme diem, quem tibi candidus
    Spondet vesper, & albis
      Cras Hor√¶ revehent equis.

      Great things to greater growth doe thus increase,
      And with least paines, improve themselves by peace.
        Here, tops of Hills, themselves behold,
          In all their flowry pride unfold.
      The Poplar now that shakes, when th‚ÄôEast winds blow
      Stood cloth‚Äôd in gray, under the ling‚Äôring snow:
        The Springs that now so nimbly rise,
          Were all of late lock‚Äôd up, in Ice:
      The fields that now with blushing Roses spread,
      Lay barren, and in hardest frost all hid:
        The birds which chirping sit i‚Äôth‚ÄôSpring;
          When Winter comes, forget to sing.
      Breake off delayes then, and from grievous care
      A constant day, set by; which th‚Äôev‚Äôning faire
        Doth promise, and the next dayes Sun
          With his white Steeds will freely run.

  _Ad Paulum Iordanum Vrsinum Bracciani Ducem._
  Bracciani agri am≈ìnitatem commendat, ad quam per ferias Septembres

  _Ode 1. Lib. Epod._

          [Decoration]

          To _Paulus Iordanus Vrsinus_, Duke of _Bracciano_.
          Hee commends the pleasantnesse of the Countrey, where
          in the feasts of _September_, he retyred from _Rome_.

          _Ode 1. Lib. Epod._

  Huc √¥ quietis apta Musis otia,
    Levesque Ludorum chori;
  Huc feriant√ªm Ph≈ìbe Musarum pater,
    Huc hospitales Grati√¶;
  Huc delicatis ite permisti Jocis
    Non inverecundi Sales:
  H√Æc otiosi mite Bracciani solum
    Vago coronemus pede.

      Appeare ye spritefull Quire with choicest sports,
        All pastime fit for _Ph≈ìbus_ Courts;
      And Thou great Master of the Revels, joyne
        The Graces, to thy Daughters nine;
      Witt pure and quaint, with rich conceits and free
        From all obsc√¶ne scurrilitie:
      Here free from care, nimbly let‚Äôs dance a round
        Upon _Bracciano_‚Äôs softer ground.

  Clemens supino clivus assurgit jugo,
    C√¶lumq; paulatim subit,
  Et solida subter terga scopulorum arduo
    Securus insessu premit:
  Arcisq; jactat inter alta turrium
    Insigne propugnacula,
  Timenda quondam C√¶sarum turmis ducum,
    Timenda magno Borgi√¶,
  C√πm per minant√ªm militum aratos globos
    Metuenda jaceret fulmima,
  Ageretque profugum C√¶sarem, & quassum metu;
    Adusque promissum _Nihil_.

      A gentle Cliffe from a steep Hill doth rise
        That even to Heaven, mounts by degrees,
      And safe, with uncouth passage, leanes upon
        The solid backs, of Rocks and stone:
      Whence ‚Äômid‚Äôst the Bulwark‚Äôd Forts, we may descry
        A displayd Banner from on hye,
      Which to th‚ÄôImperiall force a terrour was,
        A terrour to great _Borgias_,
      When through the brasen troops of‚Äôs threatning foes,
        His fearfull thunder-bolts he throwes,
      Pursuing routed _C√¶sar_, whom he brought
        To that he promis‚Äôd him, to _nought_.

  H√Æc ille magnus fr√¶nat Etruscas opes
    _Ursinus_ Heroum decus,
  H√¶res avit√¶ laudis, & princeps caput
    Magn√¶q; laus Oenotri√¶.
  Circ√πm coruscis scena quercetis viret,
    C√¶lumque verrit frondibus,
  Suoque colles vestit, & patentibus
    Sese theatris explicat.
  Admota muris pon√® Nympharum domus
    Aprica pr√¶bet littora:
  Ripamque Baccho jungit, & vallum prop√®.
    Lentis flagellat fluctibus.

      Great _Ursin_ here puts reynes toth‚Äô_Tuscan_ pow‚Äôre
        The grace of _Heroes_ and the flow‚Äôre;
      Heire to his father‚Äôs worth, chiefe guide and stay
        And praise of great _Oenotria_.
      A Bow‚Äôre growes green, set round with trembling Okes
        Which fanns the Heavens with gentle strokes.
      It clothes the Hills, and spreads it selfe all over
        To th‚Äôopen Theaters a cover.
      Close joyn‚Äôd to th‚Äôwalls, the Nymphs coole Arbour stands,
        Which to the Sunny shore commands;
      By these a banke of Vines, which th‚Äôneighbour Trench
        With milder waves doth daily drench.

  Majore nusquam stagna Neptuno sonant,
    Aut √¶stuantis Larii,
  Aut qui severo tangit Albanus lacu
    Inenatabilem Styga:
  Aut qu√¶ procellis gaudet, & magno fremit
    Superba ponto Julia:
  Nec major usquam spumat, & rupes truci
    Benacus assultat salo.
  Intonsa curvo monte circumstant juga,
    Mitesque despectant aquas.

      Nowhere the Lakes with fuller Sea doth roare,
        Either of _Larius_ that boyles o‚Äôre,
      Or rough _Albanus_ whose troubled waves doe mix
        With the unnavigable Styx:
      Not stormy _Julia_, when her swelling pride
        Most rageth in her highest tyde:
      _Benacus_ doth not raise more froth, when he
        Assaults the rocks with fiercest Sea.
      With rugged tops the bending mountaines round
        Upon the slow calme streames looke downe.

  Nivosus illinc terga Romanus movet,
    C√¶loque diducit minas:
  Illinc caducis ilicem quassat comis
    Sublime Cymini caput:
  Crudumque Boream frangit impotentibus
    Depr√¶liaturum Notis,
  Terrisque lat√® regnat, & c√¶li minis
    Opponit hibernum latus.

      _Romanus_ here his snowy back up-reares.
        And drawes downe envy from the starres:
      The lofty head of _Cyminus_ here shakes
        The Oke with trembling leaves which quakes,
      And holds off _Boreas_, when his rawer blasts
        ‚ÄôGainst the weake Southerne winds he casts,
      Commands the Country farre, and out he sets
        His Winter sides against Heavens threats.

  Amica sternit interim lacum quies,
    Fluctusque fluctu nititur,
  Et ipsa secum pigra luctatur Thetis,
    Aqu√¶que colludunt aquis:
  Quas vel carin√¢, vel citata turgido
    Findit phaselus linteo:
  Pinn√¢que lat√® vitreum cogens pecus
    Velente lino truditur,
  Set√¢que piscem ducit, & raris procul
    Lacum coronat retibus.

      Meane while a pleasant calme doth smooth the Lake,
        The waves ‚Äôgainst one another breake,
      Mild _Thetis_ selfe, with her own selfe finds sport,
        And waters doe the waters court:
      Through which a ship doth cut, with pleasant gales,
        Or nimble Barke with swelling sayles:
      The large-fin‚Äôd Chrystall cattell as they goe
        Are forced whether they will or no
      With ready dragnet; then with lines of haire
        They round the Lake, or Nets more rare.

  Hinc alta lucet divitis Poll√¶ domus,
    Hinc pinguis Anguilaria:
  Trebonianas hinc amica vineas
    Vadosa plangunt √¶quora:
  Hinc delicati fundus Aurel√Æ nitet,
    Lymph√¶ salutar√Æs pater:
  Und√†que morbos arcet, & vivacibus
    Lucem fluentis eluit.

      Rich _Polla‚Äôs_ stately house there shines, and here
        Full stored Fish-ponds doe appeare:
      The friendly Foords which toward the Sea doe lye
        Water _Trebonian_ Vineyards¬†by;
      Here neat _Aurelius_ farme looks gay, chiefe Lord
        And Master of that healthfull Foord,
      Whose water cures diseases, whose quick springs
        Doe purge out all infectious things.

  At qu√† superbum fontibus nomen dedit
    Suumque Flora marginem,
  Vivis perennes decidunt saxis aqu√¶,
    Camposque decursu lavant,
  Patremque long√® Tybrin, & regem sonant,
    Rom√¶que servitum fluunt.
  Sincera circ√πm regna natur√¶ nitent;
    Et artis immunes loci:
  Adhucque virgo sulcus, & montes adhuc
    Molleis inexperti manus,
  Meramque Bacchus Tethyn, & Bacchum Thetis,
    Et pinguis invitat Ceres.

      Where _Flora_ makes the banks, and gives the name
        To Fountaines, proud of so much fame;
      From lively stones perpetuall waters flow,
        And wash the fields wheresoe‚Äôre they goe,
      Their father _Tyber_, and their King they found
        And flow to _Rome_, with homage bound.
      Nature doth purely there advance each part,
        Not any place is help‚Äôd by Art:
      As yet the virgin furrow, th‚ÄôHills yet stand
        Untouch‚Äôd, by any tender hand.
      Chast _Tethys_, _Bacchus_ courts, _Thetis_ doth woo
        _Bacchus_ againe, and _Ceres_ too.

  Hinc ille l√¶tus surgit, & tenacibus
    Inserpit ulmis Evius,
  Udoque cornu turget, & fluentibus
    Crinem racemis impedit.
  Non Lesbos illi, non odorati magis
    Vineta rident Massici,
  Aut qu√¶ Falernis educata solibus
    Sublucet uv√¶ purpura.

      Hence _Evius_ cheerfull rises, and doth twine
        With th‚ÄôElme, that closely clings toth‚Äô Vine,
      With‚Äôs plenteous horne he swells, his locks hang by--
        With flowing Clusters tangled lye.
      Not _Lesbos_ him, nor the sweet smelling grace,
        Of rich _Campania_‚Äôs fruitfull race
      Delights; the purple Grape not so faire showes,
        In the _Falernian_ sun that growes.

  Sed nec Falisci glaream malit soli,
    Nec pinguis uber Rh√¶ti√¶;
  Nec flava tant√πm culta felicis Cypri,
    Grai√°mve dilexit Rhodon:
  Quant√πm suis superbit, & sese suis
    Miratur in canalibus.
  Circ√πm beatis imperat campis Ceres.
    Lateque rura possidet:
  Et arva flavo messium fluctu tument,
    Motuque culmorum natant.

      Hee‚Äôl not preferre _Faliscus_ sandy ground,
        Nor _Rh√¶tia_, that doth so abound;
      The yellow Tilths of happy _Cyprus_, hee
        Ne‚Äôre lov‚Äôd so much, nor _Rhodos_¬†by:
      As in his owne -- in his owne channells hee
        Hugging himselfe, doth proudly lye.
      Sole Empresse _Ceres_ of the fertile lands
        Whose large possessions shee commands:
      The fields with yellow waves doe ebbe and flow,
        The ripe eares swim, when winds doe blow.

  Innube rarus inquinat c√¶lum vapor,
    Aut tensa nimbis vellera:
  Aut √® Boreis bella ventorum plagis,
    Raucusque silvarum fragor
  Auditur usquam: non protervis insonant
    Exercitati Syrtibus,
  Euris & Austris contumaces Africi,
    Et perduellibus Notis.
  Tant√πm serenus Vesper, & tenerrima
    Etesiarum flamina.

      No vapour, here, Heavens cleared face doth staine,
        No clowdy fleece stretch‚Äôd out with raine:
      The Northerne blasts are still, and all at peace,
        And the hoarse noise o‚Äôth‚Äô woods doth cease:
      The stubborne _Africke_ winds that use to stray
        About th‚Äôunruly sandy Sea,
      Are all hush‚Äôd up, and no Alarum sound
        To th‚Äôother winds, entrenched round;
      Onely the Evening faire, a gentle gale
        Of winds that each year never faile:

  Albique soles, & serena lucidis
    Aspirat aura montibus:
  Puramque c√¶lo provehunt Hor√¶ facem,
    Et Ph≈ìbus Horarum pater
  Peculiari luce colles irrigat,
    Pron√°que perfundit die.
  Ramis tepentes ingruunt Favonii
    Jocantis aur√¶ sibilo,
  Et temperatis provocant suspiriis,
    Leniq; somnum murmure.

      The bright Sun darting through th‚Äôenlightned Ayre
        His beames, doth guild the Moutaines cleare,
      The houres drive on heav‚Äôns torch, that shine so bright,
        And _Ph≈ìbus_ father of the light--
      With a peculiar influence bedewes
        The Hills all o‚Äôre, when night ensues.
      The warme _Favonian_ winds with whistling gale
        Doe merrily the boughs assaile,
      And with their temperate breath, and gentle noise,
        Sweet pleasing slumbers softly raise.

  At non loquaces interim nidi tacent,
    Matresque nidorum vag√¶.
  Sed aut maritis turtur in ramis gemit,
    Et saxa rumpit questibus,
  Aut l√¶ta lat√® cantibus mulcet loca
    Famosa pellex Thraci√¶.
  Silvisq; coram plorat, & crudelibus
    Accusat agris Terea:
  Qu√¶cumque m≈ìsta vocibus dicunt aves,
    Respondet argutum nemus,
  Affatur alnum quercus, ornum populus,
    Affatur ilex ilicem,
  Et se vicissim collocuta redditis
    Arbusta solantur sonis.

      The prateling Nests meane while no silence keep,
        Their wandring guests ne‚Äôre sleep.
      To‚Äôs mate, the Turtle ‚Äômong‚Äôst the branches grones,
        And with complaints breakes hardest stones,
      The Nightingale, the pleasant Groves about
        Refresheth, with her warbling note,
      Bewayles her losse to th‚Äôwoods, i‚Äôth‚Äô cruell fields
        ‚ÄôGainst _Tereus_ her cryes shee yeilds:
      And what the mournfull birds doe so complaine,
        The shrill woods answer back againe.
      The Oke, the Alder tells; the Poplar tree
        The Ash; and that, the Elme stands¬†by.
      The Groves rejoyce with th‚ÄôEccho they afford
        And tell them backe--ev‚Äôn word for word.

  Huc √¥ Quirit√ªm ductor, huc Oenotri√¶
    O magne regnator plag√¶
  _Jordane_, tandem plenus urbis & fori,
    Rerumque magnarum satur,
  Sepone curis temet, & domesticis
    Furare pectus otiis.
  Hic vel tuarum lene tranabis vadum
    Opacus umbris arborum,
  Tuosque colleis inter, & tuas procul
    Perambulabis ilices:

      _Jordanus_ here, hither thy selfe command,
        Great Ruler of th‚Äô_Oenotrian_ land.
      Withdraw thy selfe from cares, from all resort
        So cloy‚Äôd with‚Äô Citie, and with Court,
      So full of great affaires, at length thy breast
        Convey to thy domestick rest.
      Here thou may‚Äôst passe thy Foord, in gloomy shade,
        On each side, by thine owne trees made,
      And here between thy Mounts, with tall Okes set,
        A large walke thou shalt get:

  Vel cum Decembri campus, & prima nive
    Vicina canescent juga;
  Nunc impeditas mollibus plagis feras,
    Silvamq; pr√¶cinges metu:
  Nunc incitato capream rumpes equo,
    Teloque deprendes aprum;
  Jactoq; cervos collocabis spiculo,
    Furesq; terrebis lupos.
  Quid si Latin√¶ laus _Alexander_ plag√¶,
    Sacr√¶que sidus purpur√¶,
  Tecum paterno feriabitur solo,
    Seseq; curis eximet;
  Tuique cives, hospitesq; civium
    Toto fruemur gaudio.

      Or in _December_, when the fields looke white,
        And th‚ÄôHills, with the earlyest snow doth light;
      Sometime th‚Äôentangled game, with twining nett
        I‚Äôth‚Äô wood, with feare thou shalt besett:
      Sometimes with courser fleet, pursue full sore,
        The Buck thou mayst, sometimes the Bore;
      With thy thrown dart the red Deer thou shalt stick.
        And th‚Äôfrighted ravenous Wolves shalt strick,
      And if that Starre o‚Äôth‚Äô sacred dignity
        The glory of all _Italy_,
      Will also from his cares, himselfe make free,
        And keepe his Festivals with thee;
      Each Citizen of thine, and every guest
        With the compleatest joy is blest.




  _Ad fontem Sonam._

  In patrio fundo, dum Rom√¢ rediisset.

  Ode 2. Lib. Epod.

  Fons innocenti lucidus magis vitro
    Pur√¢que purior nive,
  Pagi voluptas, una Nympharum sitis,
    Ocelle natalis soli.
  Longis viarum languidus laboribus
    Et mole curarum gravis
  Thuscis ab usque gentibus redux, tibi
    Accline prosterno latus:
  Permitte siccus, qu√† potes, premi; cav√¢
    Permitte libari manu.
  Sic te quietum nulla perturbet pecus,
    Ramusv√® lapsus arbore:
  Sic dum loquaci prata garritu secas,
    Et l√¶tus audiri salis;
  Assibilantes populetorum com√¶
    Ingrata ponant murmura
  Tibi, lyr√¶q; Vatis: haud frustr√† sacer
    Nam si quid _Urbanus_ probat,
  Olim fluenti leu√® Blandusi√¶ nihil
    Aut Sirmioni debeas.


      To the Fountaine Sona,

      _When hee returned._

      _Ode 2. Lib. Epod._

      O Fount more cleare then spotlesse glasse,
        More pure, then purest snow e‚Äôre was,
      The Nymphs desire, and Countries grace,
        Thou joy of this my Native place.
      Tyr‚Äôd with a tedious journey,¬†I,
        And press‚Äôd with cares that grievous lye,
      From the farre _Tuscan_ Land made free
        Thus low I bow my selfe to thee:
      Oh, if thou canst, vouchsafe to bee
        Press‚Äôd, and with hollow palme drawne dry.
      So let thy peace no wandring beast
        Disturb, no broken bough, thy rest:
      So when thou cutt‚Äôst with prattling noise
        The Meads, and leap‚Äôst, men heare thy voice;
      May th‚Äôwhistling leaves of Poplar trees
        With their unwelcome murmurs cease--
      To thee, and thy Priests Lute: if nought
        _Urban_ approves, in vaine is thought
      T‚Äô_Blandusia_ thou canst nothing owe;
        Nor to milde flowing _Sirmio_.

      _Ode 3. Lib. Epod._

  At ille, _Flacce_, nunc erit beatior
    Qui mole curarum procul
  Paterna liquit rura, litigantium
    Solutus omni jurgio;
  Nec solis √¶stum frugibus timet suis,
    Nec sidus hiberni Jovis,
  Rixasq; vitat, & scelesta curi√¶
    Rapacioris limina.
  Ergo aut profanis hactenus negotiis
    Amissa plorat sidera;
  Aut in reduct√¢ sede dispersum gregem
    Errantis animi colligit,
  Postquam beat√¶ lucra conscienti√¶
    Quadrante libravit suo.

      But, _Flaccus_, now more happy he appeares,
        Who, with the burthen of his cares,
      Farre off hath left his father‚Äôs ground, set free
        From the fierce wrangling Lawyer‚Äôs fee;
      No scorching heat, nor blasts of Winter _Jove_,
        Doth hurt his fruit, or him can move:
      Hee shuns all strifes, and never doth resort
        The sinfull gates o‚Äôth‚Äô greedy Court.
      But either doth bewayle those dayes and nights,
        Lost by him in prophane delights;
      Or else retyr‚Äôd, strives to collect and find
        The dispers‚Äôd flock of‚Äôs wandring mind;
      Having first fairly pois‚Äôd the recompence
        And gaines of a good conscience.

  Idem, propinqu√¢ nocte, stellatas vigil
    C√πm vesper accendit faces,
  Ut gaudet immortale mirari jubar,
    Terr√¢que majores globos,
  Et per cadenteis intueri lacrymas
    Rimosa lucis atria,
  Qu√¶ Christe tecum, virgo qu√¶ tecum colat
    Perennis h√¶res s√¶culi!
  Volvuntur aureis interim stella√¶ rotis,
    Pigrumque linquunt exulem,
  Per ora cujus uberes eunt aqu√¶,
    Somnos quod avertat graveis.

      At evening, when the harbinger of night
        The torches of the sky doth light,
      How he admires th‚Äôimmortall rayes breake forth,
        And their bright Orbes, more large then earth;
      How through his trickling teares, he heips his fight,
        Unto the open Courts of light,
      Which with thy selfe, √¥ Christ, thy selfe in pray‚Äôr
        He‚Äô Adores, t‚ÄôEternall life an heire!
      The Starres with golden wheeles, are hurried¬†by,
        And let their prostrate exile lye,
      Over whose face, the plenteous teares doe stray,
        Which chase all drowsie sleepe away;

  At quando lotum Gangis aut Indi fretis
    Jam Ph≈ìbus attollit caput,
  Mentis profundus, & sui totus minor
    Irata flectit numina:
  Vel cum sereno fulserit dies Jove,
    Aprilibusque feriis,
  Assueta c√¶lo lumina, in terras vocat
    Lateq; prospectum jacit,
  Camposq; lustrat, & relucentem su√¢
    Miratur in scen√¢ _Deum_.

      Assoone as _Ph≈ìbus_ head begins t‚Äôappeare,
        Lately in _Indus_ streames made cleare,
      From depth of soule, lesse then himselfe he lies,
        And bends the angry pow‚Äôrs with cryes:
      Or when the Sun shines cleare, the aire serene,
        And _Aprill_ Festivals begin,
      His eyes, so us‚Äôd to Heaven, he downe doth throw,
        On a large prospect here below:
      He viewes the fields, and wondring stands to see
        In‚Äôs shade the shining Deitie.

  En omnis inquit, herba non morantibus
    In astra luctatur comis:
  Semota c√¶lo lacrymantur, & piis
    Liquuntur arva fletibus;
  Ligustra canis, & ros√¶ rubentibus
    Repunt in auras brachiis;
  Astrisque panda nescio quid pallido
    Loquuntur ore lilia,
  Et ser√≤ blandis ingemunt suspiriis,
    Et man√® rorant lacrymis.
  Eg√≥ne solus, solus in terris piger
    Tenace figor pondere?

      See how (saies he) each herb with restlesse leaves
        To th‚Äô starres doth strive and upward heaves:
      Remov‚Äôd from heaven they weep, the field appeares
        All o‚Äôre dissolv‚Äôd in pious teares:
      The white-flowr‚Äôd Woodbine, and the blushing Rose
        Branch into th‚Äôaire with twining boughs;
      The pale-fac‚Äôd Lilly on the bending stalke,
        To th‚Äôstarres I know not what doth talke;
      At night with fawning sighes they‚Äôexpresse their fears
        And in the morning drop downe teares.
      Am I alone, wretch that I am, fast bound
        And held with heavy weight, to th‚Äôground?

  Sic & propinquas allocutus arbores,
    Et multa coram fontibus
  Rivisque fatus, qu√¶rit Auctorem _Deum_
    Formosa per vestigia.
  Quod si levandas mentis in curas vigil
    Ruris suburbani domus,
  Quales Lucisci, vel Nemecini Lares,
    Udumv√® Besdani nemus
  Rudeis adornet rustic√¢ mensas dape
    Siccos sub Augusti dies;

      Thus spake he to the neighbouring trees, thus he
        To th‚ÄôFountaines talk‚Äôd, and streames ran¬†by,
      And after, seekes the great Creator out
        By these faire traces of his foot.
      But if a lightsome Country house that‚Äôs free
        From care, such as _Luciscu‚Äôs_ bee,
      Or _Nemicini‚Äôs,_ if _Besdan_‚Äôs fruitfull field
        Can Grace to his rude table yeild,
      To his plaine board with country dainties set,
        In _August_‚Äôs dry and parching heat;

  Jam tunc sub ipsum limen, aut domestic√¢
    Lenis sub umbr√¢ populi,
  Expectat omnis hospitem suum penses,
    Et concha sinceri salis,
  Pressiq; meta lactis, & purus calix,
    Et hospitalis amphora,
  Et fraga, raris verna qu√¶ dumis legit,
    Jucunda panis pr√¶mia.
  Non me scari tunc, non Lucrinorum gravis
    Sagina mulorum juvet:
  Sed cereus palumbus, aut turtur niger;
    Aut anser amnis accola,
  Et eruditam qu√¶ fugit gulam faba,
    L√¶tumque nec simplex olus,
  Et qu√¶ suprema colligitur, ac gravi
    Patella nil debet foro.

      Even at his dore, under a private shade
        By a thick pleasant Poplar made,
      Provision of all sorts, expect their guest,
        A shell with salt, pure and the best,
      New bread, for which, ‚Äômidst the thin bryars, the Mayd
        Picks Strawberries, and‚Äôs gladly payd.
      Cheese newly press‚Äôd, close by, the friendly Cann
        With Cup cleane wash‚Äôd, doth ready stan‚Äô.
      With me the _Lucrine_ dainties will not downe,
        The Scare, nor Mullet that‚Äôs well growne;
      But the Ring-dove plump, the Turtle dun doth looke,
        Or Swan, the sojourner o‚Äôth‚Äô brooke,
      A messe of Beanes which shuns the curious pallet,
        The cheerfull and not simple sallet;
      Clusters of grapes last gathered, that misse
        And nothing owe to th‚Äôweighty presse.

  Post h√¶c vel inter l√¶ta quercetis juga,
    Vel inter amneis juverit
  Vitare tristeis post meridiem Notos
    Sub √¶sculo vel ilice;
  Nigrumv√® littus, aut opaca lubricis
    Tranare stagna lintribus,
  Jact√¢que fruge ludibundum ducere
    Tremente piscem line√¢.
  Remugit ingens interim tauris nemus,
    Umbrosa balant flumina;
  Et aut in antris garriunt acanthides,
    Aut in rubis luscinia.

      Then after noone he takes a kind of pride
        To th‚ÄôHills to walke, or River side,
      And ‚Äômidst the pleasant Okes, a shade doth find,
        T‚Äôavoyd the blasts o‚Äôth‚Äô Southern wind;
      To th‚Äôdarksome shore, by the deep poole he goes,
        And through, with nimble Boat he rowes;
      Sometimes the sporting fish, his baite thrown¬†in,
        Hee plucks up with his trembling line.
      Meane while th‚Äô spacious woods with ecchoing note
        Doe answer to the Bulls wide throat,
      The shady rivers bleat; the Nightingale
        I‚Äôth‚Äô bushes chirps her dolefull tale.

  Hinc per rubeta pastor errantes capras
    Vocante cogit fistul√¢:
  Illinc herili messor √® campo redux
    Alterna plaudit carmina;
  Et pressa sectos plaustra per sulcos gemunnt
    Ruptura ruris horrea.
  At nec tacemus pon√® considentium
    Dulcis manus sodalium;
  Nec infacet√¢ sermo differtur mor√¢,
    Sed innocentibus jocis,
  Multoq; tinctus, sed verecundo sale,
    Innoxium trahit d√Æem.
  H√¶c si videret f√¶nerator Alphius,
    Olim futurus rusticus,
  Quam collocarat Idibus pecuniam,
    Nollet Kalendis ponere.

      With‚Äôs hastning pipe the sheapheard drives away
        His flocke, which through the thickets stray:
      To which as from the field they passe along,
        Each mower sings by course, his song;
      O‚Äôre yeilding furrowes, carts full press‚Äôd with corne
        Groane, and are like to breake the barne.
      Our worke once done, we doe not silent sit,
        When knots of our good fellowes meet;
      Nor is our talke prolong‚Äôd with rude delay;
        In harmlesse jests we spend the day;
      Jests dip‚Äôd in so much salt, which rubbing shall
        Onely make fresh our cheeks, not gall.
      If that rich churle, this had but seen, when hee
        A Country man began to¬†be,
      The money which i‚Äôth‚Äô Ides hee scraped in
        Next month hee‚Äôd not put out agen.

  _Epig._ 4. _Ex Lib. Ep._

  Veniat delectus meus in hortum suum. _Cant._¬†5.

  Pulcher Amor sumpsit rudis instrumenta coloni,
    Et sua deposuit tela suasque faces:
  Et manibus stivam rapuit; castique laboris
    Ad sua ruricolas junxit aratra boves.
  Ilicet, ut facili subvertit vomere corda,
    Castaque virginibus Gratia crevit agris;
  Flos, ait, unus abest: sunt cetera millia florum;
    Ut nullus possit, _Christe_, deesse, Veni.

      _Let my beloved come into his Garden._ Cant.¬†5.

      Love takes the tooles of a rude Country clowne,
        His owne Artill‚Äôry, and his torch layes down;
      With staffe in‚Äôs hand, Oxen to th‚ÄôPlow he set
        For tillage, and such honest labour fit;
      Straight, as he turn‚Äôd up hearts with easie share,
        And grace i‚Äôth‚Äô virgin-furrowes did appeare,
      ‚ÄôMongst thousand others, one flower, quoth he, is mist:
        That none may wanting be, come thou, O Christ.

  Qualis erat, tuus ille? tuus pulcherrimus ille?
    Dicebat nuper barbara turba mihi.
  Arripio dextr√¢ pennam, l√¶vaque tabellam,
    Et noto, _Christe_, tuo quicquid in orbe noto.
  Pingo rosas, aurum, gemmas, viridaria, silvas,
    Arva, lacus, celeri sidera pingo manu;
  Et tabulam monstrans, Noster pulcherrimus, inquam,
    Qualis erat, vultis discere? talis erat.


      Who is thy Beloved? _Out of Cant._¬†5.

      What is that Spouse of thine? that fairest Hee?
        The barb‚Äôrous people said, of late, to mee.
      A Pen I tooke, and in a Tablet drew
        Whatsoe‚Äôre, O Christ, in thy blest orbe I view.
      Roses, and Gold I paint, Gems, Groves, Corne-land,
        Green Gardens, Lakes, and Stars with nimble hand;
      Would you needs learne, what might my fairest bee?
        Looke o‚Äôre this tablet, pray, O such was Hee.

  Non generant similes P√¶stana rosaria flores,

  Non h√¶c purpureis mater Corcyra viretis,

  C√πm nullas habeant natales lilia terras,
    Qui neget √® cast√¢ lilia nata manu?


      Ep.¬†48.

      _To ---- bearing Lillyes in her hand._

      These Lillyes which on virgin stalks doe bend,
        From whence do they their chaster leaves extend?
      The _P√¶stan_ beds such flowres did ne‚Äôre bring forth,
        Nor _Pharian_ fields e‚Äôre gloried in such worth:
      _Alcinous_ purple banks, ne‚Äôre teem‚Äôd with these,
        Nor rich _Carystos_ watred by the Seas.
      Since then these flow‚Äôres no native place do know,
        Who can deny from her chast hand they grow.

      With hairs unkemb‚Äôd Repentance late did mourn,

      Shee‚Äôs said, to let loose raynes t‚Äôuntamed griefe,
        To‚Äôaffoord her moyst‚Äôned bosome, no reliefe,
      But when th‚Äôdesks agen, thy sicknesse tam‚Äôd,
        Thou mountd‚Äôst, she‚Äôs said her careless haire t‚Äôhave kemb‚Äôd
      T‚Äôhave bridled in her conquer‚Äôd griefe, and smile,
        Of teares, her open‚Äôd bosome to beguile.
      Who cannot then be glad, thou being safe?
        When teares rejoyce, and griefe it selfe doth laugh.

  Ah sitio, clamas, Princeps pulcherrime rerum:
    Non habeo pro te dulcia vina, siti.
  Tu tamen, ah sitio, clamas: dabo pocula, Sponse:

      Yet oh I thirst, thou cry‚Äôst: a Cup to thee
        Woes mee! I‚Äôle give: but mix‚Äôd with gall‚Äôt must¬†be.

ERRATA (Noted by transcriber)

_As printed:_

  _Introduction:_ The editor‚Äôs name, printed ‚ÄúRoestvig‚Äù, is more
  correctly R√∏stvig.

  _Latin:_ The use of ≈ì and √¶ in words such as ‚Äúm≈ìstus‚Äù is in the
  original. Accents are variously acute¬†¬¥, grave¬†` or circumflex¬†^,
  with no apparent difference in meaning. Some do not even mark long
  syllables.

  _English:_ Variation between -w- and -vv- is as in the original.

  _Typography:_ In both languages, titles were randomly Italic or Roman.
  Italicization (or de-italicization) of ‚Äôs in possessives is also
  random.

_Introduction_

  an interesting combination of Stoic and Platonic ideas
    [_‚Äúof / of‚Äù at line break_]

_Odes_

  _All headers were in the form ‚ÄúOde 2, Lib. 1‚Äù with the poem number
  given before the Book number. They have been conventionalized for
  this Errata list._

  Lib. 1 Ode 1
  Cum infest√¶ Thracum Copi√¶ Pannoni√¢ excessissent.
    [_‚ÄúCo./pi√¶‚Äù for ‚ÄúCo-/pi√¶‚Äù at line break_]
  The threats of cruell Warre now cease:, [_punctuation unchanged_]

  Lib. 1 Ode 2
  [title] de advers√¢ fortun√¢  [adverfa]
  Unmanly howlings, _Lycuas_, leave,
    [_error for Lycas or Lycus (English title has ‚ÄúLycas‚Äù; Latin has
    ‚ÄúLycus‚Äù)_]

  Lib. 1 Ode 13
  Fortune a double ball doth often throw. [doulble]

  Lib. 2 Ode 5
  Regna procul, populosque vastos  [porcul]

  Lib. 2 Ode 8
  ... that fortune flings
    [_final ‚Äús‚Äù missing at end of long line_]

  Lib. 2 Ode 24
  And _Nereus_ with his Quicksands Boyling o‚Äôre:  [Nerens]

  Lib. 2 Ode 25
      [_The title of this Ode is printed in anomalous small capitals
      on both the Latin and the English sides_]
    Donec Lucicer aureus  [_text unchanged: probably ‚ÄúLucifer‚Äù_]
    Silvarumq; super colla comantium,  [comantnium]
    Magnorumq; salit terga cacuminum, ac  [cacumium] ac
      [_These words appear in consecutive indented lines_]

  Lib. 3 Ode 6
  I kingdome, _Marcus_, of my selfe I find
    [_Text unchanged: error for ‚Äò1 kingdome‚Äò or ‚ÄòA kingdome‚Äô?_]

  Lib. 3 Ode 12

    [_comma at end_]

  Lib. 4 Ode 3

  Lib.¬†4 Ode 44
  _Ode 44. Lib.¬†4._
    [_Number shown as printed on both Latin and English sides. The
    error may have been in the source text._]
  But Jesu! where art thou? what region‚Äôs blest  [where at]

  Lib. 4 Ode 15
  Immune t√¶d√Æ. Clarus olim  [_first word illegible_]

  Lib. 4 Ode 30
  _Ad Ianussium Skuminum._ : To _Ianusius Skuminus_.
    [_inconsistent spelling (ss:s) in original_]
  H√¶c ego si nullos fallunt insomnia maneis,  [insomia]
  Her owne and Nephew‚Äôs temples crown‚Äôd.  [Nepew‚Äôs]

  Lib. 4 Ode 32
  With nimble finger neat division;  [nible]
  And if I write, my secure chaire holds mee.  [_comma at end_]

  Lib. 4 Ode 34
  Splendidam ver√¢ sine luce gazam  [fine luce (f for long s)]

    the river (modern Vilnia)_]

  Epode 1
  His beames, doth guild the Moutaines cleare  [_spelling unchanged_]

  Epode 3

_Long ‚Äús‚Äù_

  Lib. 1, Odes 2 and 13 (Latin pages 10, 12):
  M≈ìstum sol hodi√® caput ...  [M≈ìstum fol ...]

_At the beginning of p. 10 there appears to have been an accident
with the Italic type trays. Almost all long s‚Äôs (≈ø) on p.¬†10 (signature
5v), and many on p.¬†12 (signature 6v), are misprinted as f, except in
the -st- and -ss- ligatures. The last two lines of Ode 1.2, top of
p.¬†12:_

    Quod fi de≈øuerit ≈øalix
    Fafces pauperibus ≈øubjiciet focis.

_Note the s-for-f error. In Italic fonts--used for all Latin poems
in this text--long ‚Äús‚Äù is generally _easier_ to distinguish from ‚Äúf‚Äù
than it is in Roman fonts._

_Page Numbering_

  In Lib. 1 Ode 2, English, page 13 is misprinted as page 31.
  In Lib. 4 Ode 12, Latin, page 68 is misprinted as page 98.
  In Lib. 4, Ode 30, page numbers 95-96 are repeated, and the setback
    in numbering continues to the end of the text. The folio numbers
    (in duodecimo, or sets of 24 pages) remain correct.
