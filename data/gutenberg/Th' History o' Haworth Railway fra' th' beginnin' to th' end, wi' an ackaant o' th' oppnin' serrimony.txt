PREFACE TO THE TENTH EDITION.


The Author of this well-known, amusing, and celebrated pamphlet was born
on the 22nd March, 1836, at a place midway between Keighley and Haworth,
called Hoylus End in a simple cottage near the Whins Delf, at the
terminus of the quaint old hamlet known as Hermit Hole, in the Parish of
Bingley.  He began early in life to write songs and uncouth rhymes, and
even as a boy He wrote satires so caustic that they are remembered even
to the present day.

However, the Haworth Railway cropped up, and this found him ample food
for his pen; and as this is the Tenth Edition of the work it is clear
that it is still in popular favour.




Thâ€™ History oâ€™ Haworth Railway,
FRAâ€™ THâ€™ BEGINNING TO THâ€™ END.

CHAPTER I.


Before I commence mi short history oâ€™ Haworth Railway, it might be as
weel to say a word or two abaat Haworth itseln.  Itâ€™s a city atâ€™s little
nawn, if onny, in thâ€™ history oâ€™ Ingland, tho thareâ€™s no daat but itâ€™s as
oud as Methuslam, if net ouder, yet wiâ€™ being built so far aat oâ€™ thâ€™
latitude oâ€™ civilised nashuns, nobodyâ€™s scarcely nawn owt abaat it wal
lately.  Thâ€™ faanders of it is sed to be people fra thâ€™ Eastern
countries, for they tuk fearful after em in Haworth iâ€™th line
oâ€™soothsayers, magishuns, anâ€™ istralegers; but whether they cum fra thâ€™
East or thâ€™ West, thay luk oud fasunâ€™d enuff.  Nah thâ€™ city is situated
in a vary romantic part oâ€™ Yorkshur, anâ€™ within two or three miles oâ€™th
boundary mark for thâ€™ next county.  Sum foak sez it wur thâ€™ last place
â€™at wur made, but itâ€™s a mistak, for it looks oud fashunâ€™d enuff to be
thâ€™ first â€™at wur made.  Gurt travellers sez it resembles thâ€™ cities oâ€™
Rome anâ€™ Edinburgh, for thareâ€™s a deal a up-hills afore yo can get tut
top onâ€™t; but iâ€™ landing yoâ€™d be struck wi wonder anâ€™ amazementâ€”wat wi
thâ€™ tall biggens, monnements, dooms, hampitheaters, and so on, for
instance Church, or rather thâ€™ Cathedrall, is a famous biggen, anâ€™ stands
majestekely oâ€™th top oâ€™ thâ€™ hill.  It hez been sed at it wur Olever
Cramwell that wur struck wiâ€™ thâ€™ appearance oâ€™thâ€™ Church an thâ€™ city,
alltagether, wal he a mack a consented to have it thâ€™ hed-quarters for
thâ€™ army anâ€™ navy.

Thâ€™ faander oâ€™thâ€™ Church is sed to be one Wang be Wang, one oâ€™thâ€™ Empros
oâ€™ China as com ower in a balloon an browt wiâ€™ him all his relations but
his grandmuther.  Thâ€™ natives at that toime wur a mack a wild; but iâ€™
mixing up wiâ€™ thâ€™ balloonites thay soin becum civilized and bigd thâ€™
Church atâ€™s studden fra that toime to nah, wiâ€™thâ€™ exepshun oâ€™ one end,
destroyed at sum toime, sum sez it wur be war.  Some sez West End an thâ€™
Saath End wur destroyed, but its a mack a settled on by thâ€™ wiseuns it
wur witchcraft; but be it as it may, Haworth an thâ€™ foak aâ€™ together is
as toff as paps, an hez stud aat weel, an no daht but it wod a flerished
before Lundun, Parris, or Jerusalem, for centries back, if they hed a
Railway, but after nearly all Grate Britten anâ€™ France had been furnished
wiâ€™ a railway, thâ€™ people iâ€™ Haworth began to feel uneazy anâ€™ felt
inclined no longer to wauk several miles to get to a stashun if they wur
baan off like.  Anâ€™ besides, they thout it were high time to begin anâ€™
mak sum progress iâ€™ thâ€™ world, like their naburs iâ€™ thâ€™ valley.  So they
ajetated fer a line daan thâ€™ valley as far as Keighla, anâ€™ after abaat a
hundred meettings they gat an Akt past for it iâ€™ Parliament.  So at last
a Cummittee wur formed, anâ€™ they met one neet oâ€™ purpose ta decide wen it
wod be thâ€™ moast convenient for â€™em ta dig thâ€™ first sod ta commemorate
anâ€™ start thâ€™ gurt event.  Anâ€™ a bonny rumpus thur wur, yoâ€™ mind, for yoâ€™
maâ€™ think ha it wur conducted when thay wur threapinâ€™ wiâ€™ one another
like a lot a oud wimen at a parish pump, wen it sud be.  One sed it mud
tak place at rush-buren, another sed next muck-spreadinâ€™ toime, a third
sed it mud be dug et gert wind day it memmery oâ€™ oud Jack K---  Well,
noan et proposishuns wud do fur the lot, and there wur such opposishun
wal it omust hung on a threâ€™ad whether thâ€™ railway went on or net, wal at
last an oud farmer, one oâ€™thâ€™ committee men, wiâ€™ a voice as hoarse as a
farm yard dog, bawls aat, â€œI propoase Pancake Tuesday.â€  So after a
little more noise it wur propoased anâ€™ seconded et Grand Trunk Railway
between thâ€™ respective taans of Keighla anâ€™ Haworth sud be commemorated
wiâ€™ digginâ€™ thâ€™ furst sod â€™o Pancake Tuesday iâ€™thâ€™ year oâ€™ our Lord 1864;
anâ€™ bi thâ€™ show oâ€™ hands iâ€™thâ€™ usual way it wur carried bi one, and that
wur Ginger Jabus, anâ€™ thâ€™ tother cud a liked to a bowt him ower, but
Jabus wornt to be bowt that time, for he hed his heart anâ€™ sowl iâ€™thâ€™
muvment, an he went abaat singingâ€”

   Come all ye lads oâ€™ high renown
   â€™At wishes well your native town,
   Rowl up anâ€™ put your money down
         And let us hev a Railway.

   Wiâ€™ Keighla foak we are behind,
   Anâ€™s hed to wauk agin wur mind;
   But soin thâ€™ crookt-leggâ€™d ens thay will find
         Weâ€™ll keep em wiâ€™ a Railway.

Well, hasumever, public notice wur made nawn, bi thâ€™ bellman crying it
all ower thâ€™ tawn, which he did to such a pitch wal heâ€™d summat to do to
keep his hat fra flying off, but he managed to do it at last to a nicety,
for thâ€™ news spread like sparks aat of a bakehouse chimla; anâ€™ wen thâ€™
day come they flockt in fra all parts, sum oâ€™th crookt-leggâ€™d ens fra
Keighla com, Lockertown and thâ€™ Owertown foak com, and oud bachelors fra
Stanbury and all parts at continent oâ€™ Haworth; foak craaded in on all
sides, even thâ€™ oud men anâ€™ wimen fra Wicken Crag anâ€™ thâ€™ Flappeters, anâ€™
strappinâ€™ foak they are yo mind, sum as fat as pigs, wiâ€™ heeads as red as
carrits, anâ€™ nimble as a india-rubber bouncer taw; anâ€™ wat wur thâ€™ best
onâ€™t it happened to be a fine day; or if it hed been made accordinâ€™ to
orders it cudent a been finer.  Shops wur all closed, anâ€™ everybody, oud
anâ€™ young hed a haliday aat oâ€™thâ€™ doors, for they were all flade oâ€™
missinâ€™ thâ€™ Grand Proceshun, which formed itseln at thâ€™ top oâ€™ Wuthren,
when it wur messured it turned aat to be two miles six inches longâ€”it
moved as follows:â€”


                          ORDER Oâ€™THâ€™ PROCESHUN.


  Thâ€™ Spring heead Band wiâ€™ thair hat bruads turned up so as they mud se
                             thair way clear,

 Lord oâ€™thâ€™ Manor iâ€™ full uniform a fut back bearinâ€™ thâ€™ Coat of Arms for
   Haworth a gert wild cratur wiâ€™ two tails on, one oâ€™ thâ€™ authur end.

Thâ€™ Members oâ€™thâ€™ Corporashun one abreast, singinâ€™ â€œa nuttinâ€™ we will go,
                               brave boys.â€

                         Big Drums anâ€™ Triangles.

    A Mahogany Wheelbarroâ€™ anâ€™ a silver spade on a cart trailâ€™d bi six
          donkeys, anâ€™ garded bi ten lazy policemen _all sober_.

                        A pair oâ€™ crakt bag-pipes.

   Thâ€™ Contractor in a sedan carried bi two waggoners iâ€™ white smocks.

 All thâ€™ young maidens fra fowerteen to thirty-nine, six abreast drest iâ€™
                    sky blue, anâ€™ singinâ€™ throo combs.

                   Twenty oud wimen nittinâ€™ stockings.

 Twenty navvies iâ€™ thair shirt sleeves wheelinâ€™ barrows wi work tools in.

       Taan skavengers wiâ€™ shouldered besums decorated wiâ€™ ribbons.

 Bellman anâ€™ Pinder arm iâ€™arm drest iâ€™ full uniform, anâ€™ thâ€™ latter na an
                then bawlinâ€™ aat waats baan to tak place.

 All scholars in thâ€™ female line lakinâ€™ at duck under water kit, anâ€™ thâ€™
       males lakinâ€™ a frog-loup, an jumpinâ€™ oâ€™ one anotherâ€™s backs.

       Taan chimla sweeps mounted oâ€™ donkeys wiâ€™ thair face white.

 All thâ€™ furiners fra thâ€™ continent oâ€™ Haworth, and crookt leggâ€™d en fra
                           Keighla followed up.

 Bulk oâ€™thâ€™ inhabitants waukinâ€™ one abreast, wiâ€™ hats off anâ€™ singinâ€™ as
                                follows:â€”

   Gather fra Stanbury lads wiâ€™ yor carrot heds,
   Come daan fra Lockertaan lads bi thiâ€™ railway;
   Come wiâ€™ yor wives, yor dowters, anâ€™ relatives,
   Shout, lads, shout for the Worth Valley Railway.
                  Railway, railway.

   Cum anâ€™ hear Oufield mak his oration,
   Yoâ€™ll say in yor conshunce he spack it rait fairly,
   Heâ€™ll say â€™at poor Haworth never yet hed fairashun,
   But heâ€™ll speak of the thing that will flurish it rarely.
                  Railway, &c.

   Saw ye Ike Ouden wiâ€™ his mehogany wheelbarrow,
   Cum dig the furst sod wiâ€™ his spade oâ€™ silver,
   He wheelâ€™d it daan thâ€™ plank as strayt as a arrow,
   Anâ€™ tipt it as weel as a navvy or delver.
                  Railway, &c.

   Saw yo the church so anshunt in history,
   Read yo the Latin words high in the steeple,
   Hear yo the sounds that arose from the belfry,
   It seemâ€™d to be shaating along wiâ€™ the people.
                  Railway, &c.

Thâ€™ Railway wur iâ€™ iverybodyâ€™s maath, wat wi singinâ€™ anâ€™ shaatinâ€™, them
â€™at cud do northur wisperâ€™d in one anutherâ€™s earsâ€”Railway.  But gettinâ€™
to whear thâ€™ ceremuny wur to tak place, thâ€™ proceshun halted anâ€™ formed
itseln into a raand ring, anâ€™ cheers wur geen wiâ€™ shakinâ€™ hats anâ€™
handkerchiefs, which lasted wal thair showders anâ€™ arms warked wal theyâ€™d
hardly strength to shut thair maaths anâ€™ don thair hats on.  But
hasumever they managed to get reight agean, anâ€™ then a parson callâ€™d Ned
Oufield gat up anâ€™ made thâ€™ following narashunâ€”

Fellow countrymen anâ€™ citizens oâ€™ Haworth, it gives me gurt plezzure to
see such a gurt event as this tak place iâ€™thâ€™ city oâ€™ Haworth, namely,
digginâ€™ thâ€™ first sod oâ€™ watâ€™s callâ€™d Grand Trunk Line between Keighla
anâ€™ your native element, anâ€™ reight pleased I am to offishiate as
chairman on this occashun.  Prehaps sum on you maint naw wat I mean wiâ€™
yer native element; but I mean yer oud mountain side, ha naw yo like yer
forefathers, yo love it dearly tho yer ancestors wur nowt but barbarians
in thâ€™ fourth and fifth centries, yet thay wur thâ€™first to embrace
christianity, which thay did in thâ€™ year 600 be thâ€™ Latin inscripshuns on
thâ€™ church steeple (loud cheers).  And although yo been behind wiâ€™ yor
Railway, ye been up iâ€™ different arts anâ€™ sciences.  Wot nashun my
friends can boast of a majishun like yor owd Jack K---?  (Loud Cheers).
He wor a credit to yoâ€™ all, an yoâ€™ wur sadly indetted to him; he
proffesied twenty year sin â€™at this event wod cum to pass (a voiceâ€”ha
wish he wur alive he sud be contractor), anâ€™ if hâ€™ed been livinâ€™ to this
day its a hundred to one but thâ€™ Railwaw wud hev been made to sum weere
else ner Keighla, for ha feel convinced et Keighla is not worthy of
amalgamashun wiâ€™ a rispectable city like Haworth.  (Hear, hear.)  For
look wat insulting langwidj theyâ€™ve used to yo at different times.
(Groans.)  First, they sed yo mucked church to mak it grow bigger.  Then
yo walkâ€™d raand taans post office at Keighla anâ€™ thout it wur thâ€™
cemetery, anâ€™ to mak up for thâ€™ lot, they call us wild craturs anâ€™ mock
wur pleasant dialect, wich is better English ner thairs.  (Groans, which
lasted for ten minits.)  Yes, my fella citizens, yoâ€™ve hed to put up wiâ€™
a deal oâ€™ slang fra theas uncultivated rascals.  (We have.)  Anâ€™ wats wur
case nur all, youâ€™ve hed to wauk, wet and dry, throâ€™ thick anâ€™ thin, iâ€™
all sorts oâ€™ weather, to Keighla, wen youâ€™ve wanted to go on thâ€™
continent or to London.  But soin yo can wauk slap to thâ€™ train in a
jiffey.  (Loud cheers.)  Mr. Oufield then thenkt his fella taansmen anâ€™
wimen anâ€™ ended his speech wiâ€™ expressinâ€™ his delight in thâ€™ loyalty
oâ€™thâ€™ people for thâ€™ railway, anâ€™ as thâ€™ time wur fast waxinâ€™ he beggâ€™d
leave to sit daan, which he did iâ€™thâ€™ midst oâ€™ laad enthusiastic
shaatinâ€™.

This beinâ€™ done, anâ€™ iverybody gotten thair maaths shut agean, Ike Ouden
gat up anâ€™ made a speech, an a grand en it wur yo mind, for if thâ€™
arkangel â€™ad dropt strayt daan fra heven anâ€™ let oâ€™th top oâ€™th platform,
it cudnâ€™t a suited thâ€™ foak better, for he began as follows:â€”

Fella citizens anâ€™ taansmen oâ€™ Haworth, wen I see before me so many
smilinâ€™ faces anâ€™ so many distingwisht citizens, I awn I felt a pang as
to my unfitness for appearinâ€™ afore yo on this occashun; but yor
cummittee wor so urgent in thair appeal to me that I wur certainly
induced to akcept thâ€™ honor o digginâ€™ thâ€™ first sod oâ€™thâ€™ Grand Trunk
Railway, which will be thâ€™ gratest blessinâ€™ â€™at iver will be iâ€™ Haworth.
But yet itâ€™s nut for me to say wat is kalkulated or unkalkulated for thâ€™
people oâ€™ Haworth to do iâ€™ thâ€™ 19th centry, yet I may ventur to say â€™at
this glorious moovement na baan to tak place will shortly prove thâ€™
greatest blessinâ€™ iver witness in â€™t city oâ€™ Haworth (Loud applause).
Look at thâ€™ export anâ€™ import of thâ€™ city, anâ€™ compare thâ€™ spavenâ€™d horse
anâ€™ cart wiâ€™ thâ€™ puffin willyhams anâ€™ all thâ€™ fine carriages.  Look at
thâ€™ difference between wen it tuk a week to go to Liverpool anâ€™ a month
to London in a oud coach, anâ€™ hev to mak wur wills afore we went.
(Enthusiastic cheering.)  Yes, my friends, we stood good chance oâ€™ beinâ€™
robbâ€™d anâ€™ plundered if net summat war.  Besides, wat an immense
diffâ€™rence it will mak to Haworth, wen shoo can export her awn
manufacturs to all thâ€™ civilised anâ€™ uncivilised world, anâ€™ by means oâ€™
steam find thair way into rejuns niver trod but bi feet oâ€™ wild craturs
anâ€™ beasts oâ€™ prey.  But to makt story short ah mean to say it will be a
grate comfort anâ€™ a blessing to both thâ€™ lame anâ€™ lazey, anâ€™ speshally to
thâ€™ latter.  But as thâ€™ time wur gettinâ€™ on fastish, as it ollus does wen
thareâ€™s owt to be done, so Mr. Ouden finisht his speech as follows:â€”

   Put yor shoulders to work anâ€™ neâ€™er be danted,
      Think yer behint anâ€™ thereâ€™s no time to dally,
   For na is the time yor assistance is wanted
      Iâ€™ makkin yor railway along the Worth Valley.

Thâ€™ Spring-head Band then played sum oâ€™ thair favorite tunes, â€˜Oud Rosen
the bow,â€™ â€˜Jesseyâ€™s Pig,â€™ anâ€™ ended wiâ€™ â€˜God save thâ€™ Queen,â€™ anâ€™ all
departed to thair homes wiâ€™ smiling faces.



CHAPTER II.


    Double, double, toil anâ€™ trouble.

Nah then lads for wark, nowt but warkâ€™ll do, anâ€™ theas â€™at canâ€™t wark mun
plan.  This wur thâ€™ cry all up an daan Haworth next morning, anâ€™ for
weeks all wor vary bizzy.  One man made a wheelbarra itâ€™h chamber, but it
wor soa big wal it cudnâ€™t be gotten aat withaat takkin thâ€™ haase side
daan.  Anuther invented a koulinâ€™ machine to koul thâ€™ muck up both sides
to save wheelbarras anâ€™ work toils for thâ€™ navvies.  Some started a
practicinâ€™ for porters a thâ€™ railway, wiâ€™ oppeninâ€™ anâ€™ shuttinâ€™ thâ€™ oven
doors wiâ€™ a bang, shaatinâ€™ aat aâ€™thâ€™ same time â€˜All aat for Haworth.â€™
One man wur trying thâ€™ dodge on, anâ€™ thâ€™ cat wur iâ€™thâ€™ ovan, anâ€™ poor
thing expectinâ€™ â€™at it wur iâ€™thâ€™ wrong place jumpt aat just at thâ€™ time
â€™at he wur wistling to start, anâ€™ wur catcht bi thâ€™ tail anâ€™ thâ€™ poor
thing lost it, for it wur cut off as clean as a wistle.  A crookt leggâ€™d
pedlâ€™r come fra Keighla one day wiâ€™ winter edges, anâ€™ thay tuk him for a
sapper anâ€™ miner â€™at hed com to mezhur for thâ€™ railway, anâ€™ mind yo they
did mak sammat on him, thay thout â€™at thâ€™ winter edges wur th' apparatus
to mezhur by.  But hasumever thâ€™ reightens cum at after, anâ€™ a sore
disaster thay hed yo mind, for thay laid plan oâ€™thâ€™ railway daan at green
swarth anâ€™ a oud kaa belanginâ€™ to Blue Beard swallowâ€™d thâ€™ job, thay
tried to save â€™em but all iâ€™ vain; a sor do wur this for both folk anâ€™
thâ€™ railway, for it put em a year or two back anâ€™ foak wur raginâ€™ mad
abaat thâ€™ kaa, anâ€™ if it hednâ€™t a been a wizenâ€™d oud thing thayâ€™d a
swallowâ€™d it aliveâ€”thâ€™ nasty, greedy oud kaa.

   Thay hed a meeting thâ€™ tother neet,
   Fair oâ€™thâ€™ top oâ€™ wuthering street,
   To see what things thayâ€™d got complete,
   Concerning Haworth railway.

   Wen Penny Wabbac tuk the chair,
   He lukt to be iâ€™ grate despair,
   He sez, good foak, are yoâ€™ aware,
   Watâ€™s happened to the railway?

   Wiâ€™ persperashun on his bra,
   He sez, good foaks, Iâ€™ll tell yoâ€™ nah;
   Oud Blue Beardâ€™s nasty wizenâ€™d kaa
   Hez swallowâ€™d plan oâ€™thâ€™ railway.

   Wiâ€™ theas remarks poor Wabbac sat,
   Wen Jonny Broth doft off his hat,
   His een they blazed like some wild cat
   Wiâ€™ vengence for the railway.

   He sed, mi blud begins to boil,
   To think â€™at we sud work and toil,
   And even thâ€™ cattle cannot thoyle
   To let us hev a railway.

   On hearing this the Haworth foak
   Began to think it wur no joak,
   An wisht â€™at greedy kaa ma choak
   â€™At swallowâ€™d plan oâ€™ thâ€™ railway.

But hasumiver thay gat ower this, anâ€™ wur net long at after afore they
hed more disasters, such as tunnils shutterinâ€™, and chapels sinkinâ€™, and
law suits, anâ€™ so an, wal Haworthers thout bet hart at both thâ€™ foak anâ€™
thâ€™ grund wur soft daan at Keighla, anâ€™ threttenâ€™d to coam sum oâ€™thâ€™
crookt leggâ€™d ens thair heads if they insinuated; anâ€™ thâ€™ Volunteers
threttenâ€™d to tak thair part if thair wur owt to do; anâ€™ farther ner
that, they vowed â€™at they wur ready to go to war wiâ€™ onny nashun that sud
insult awther them or thâ€™ railway under the present difficulties.

   For sighs anâ€™ tears anâ€™ doubts anâ€™ fears
      Prevails with greatest folly,
   For thâ€™ sinagog hez cockt its clog,
      Anâ€™ thâ€™ parsonâ€™s melancholy.

   Tunnils sink anâ€™ navvies drink,
      Anâ€™ chapels are upsetting;
   For railway shares nobody cares,
      Anâ€™ iverybodyâ€™s fretting.

   The iron horse they curse of course,
      Anâ€™ fane wud it abondon,
   Anâ€™ loyerâ€™ fees thair pockets ease,
      A thousand pounds iâ€™ Londen.

   Misfortunes speed as rank as weed,
      Anâ€™ puts on such a damper,
   Wal thâ€™ foaks declare iâ€™ great despair,
      Itâ€™s up wiâ€™ thâ€™ iron tramper.

   The Volunteers prick up thair ears,
      Anâ€™ mack a famos rattle;
   They want to run to Wimbledon,
      Or onny field oâ€™ battle.

   Thair black cravats anâ€™ toppenâ€™d hats
      Are causinâ€™ grate attraction;
   â€™Gainst Bonepart they want to start,
      Iâ€™ regular fightinâ€™ action.

   The raw recuits hev got thair suits,
      Thay brag to one another,
   To thâ€™ first campaign thayâ€™l tak thâ€™ train
      Without the slightest bother.

But hasumiver, itâ€™s gotten to thâ€™ last stage na, anâ€™ foak is very
impashent for it to come up, anâ€™ thay are preparinâ€™ to give it a grand
recepshun; one oud woman hes a peggy tub full oâ€™ meal anâ€™ saar swillings
for thâ€™ ingen, anâ€™ thay are preparin for thâ€™ passengers fra Keighla.

   Thayr standinâ€™ iâ€™ groups anâ€™ livinâ€™ iâ€™ hopes,
      Anâ€™ more disappointments thay dread,
   Wiâ€™ thayr ears touchinâ€™ thâ€™ graand, thayâ€™ve harkened for thâ€™ saand,
      Wal thayâ€™ve omust gone wrong iâ€™ thair head.

   Sez Dick oâ€™ Grate Beckers, just keep up yor peckers,
      Yoâ€™ hevnâ€™t much longer to wait,
   For blue milk anâ€™ porridge, yoâ€™ll get better forridge,
      Wen thâ€™ railway gets fairly agait.

   For itâ€™s labour iâ€™ vain to harken for thâ€™ train
      Wen allâ€™s goinâ€™ on varry steady;
   So pray yo be calm, its takkin no harm,
      Thayâ€™ll bring it as soin as itâ€™s ready.

   For thâ€™ rails are all laid, anâ€™ thairâ€™s nowt to be made,
      Nobbut thâ€™ navvies to clear off all thâ€™ muck;
   Then all â€™ll be going, for the Cowinhead mooin
      Is baan to be browt on a truck.

   So Sham oâ€™ Blue Bills, wiâ€™ thi pints and thi gills,
      Itâ€™s baan to be better for thee,
   To Keighla anâ€™ back tha ma go in a crack,
      Wen thaâ€™s baan on a bit of a spree.

   Anâ€™ John oâ€™ Pot Anns, tha mun alter thi plans,
      For tha niver can get â€™em iâ€™ force;
   For Iâ€™m happy to tell at astead oâ€™thâ€™ canal
      Theyâ€™re baan to try thâ€™ big iron horse.

   Thareâ€™s oud Jim oâ€™ Tyas is baan to be wise,
      Anâ€™ thâ€™ foak sez at heâ€™s takkin a hig;
   Heâ€™ll see it first tried afore he will ride,
      Heâ€™s daan abaat thâ€™ paper mill brig.

   He sez heâ€™ll be sure, it dropt in before,
      Anâ€™ it might do again for a pinch;
   For he sez theyâ€™ll be kapt if some on ems trapt,
      So heâ€™s blest if heâ€™ll trust it an inch.

   Thareâ€™s oud Mally Brook hez been daan to look,
      Anâ€™ shooâ€™s sore disappointed thay say;
   Shooâ€™s omost gone crakt for shoo says it weant act,
      For they nobbut can run it one way.

   Shoo sez at high class atâ€™s laid daan all thâ€™ brass,
      Just na theyâ€™re beginning to craw;
   To mak up for thâ€™ trouble theyâ€™re baan to charge double,
      For bad spekulashun it law.

   So to settle em daan, Sir Christopher Braan
      Hez tould â€™em it wur his intent,
   If thayâ€™d nobbut be quiet till things wur all reight,
      Heâ€™d give them a trip to Chow Bent.

Yes, and besides a trip to Chow Bent, they gat several more trips
promised bi thâ€™ diffrent distingwisht citizens oâ€™ Haworth.  One man
promised to give â€™em a trip to Bullockâ€™s Smithy, anuther to Tinsley
Bongs, wal thay wur gettinâ€™ quite up oâ€™ thersels anâ€™ thâ€™ railway.  Or
else thayâ€™d been for many a year anâ€™ cudnâ€™t sleep a wink at neet for
dreaminâ€™ abaat thâ€™ railway ingens, boilers, anâ€™ so on, anâ€™ mony a time
thayâ€™ve wakenâ€™d iâ€™ ther sleep shakkinâ€™ thâ€™ bed post, thinkinâ€™ thay wur
settinâ€™ thâ€™ ingen on or stoppinâ€™ it.  But thayâ€™d gotten reight anâ€™ thout
thay wur baan to hev no more trouble; but alas, it wur a mistak, for thâ€™
morninâ€™ of thâ€™ 14th oâ€™ November an oud skyologer went aat a
weather-gazinâ€™ anâ€™ planet-rulin, anâ€™ woful news anâ€™ bad omens he browt
back wi him, for he sed at thâ€™

   Stars wur shoiting in anâ€™ aat,
   Anâ€™ gravel ratches wur abaat,
   Anâ€™ thâ€™ folk, he sed thay little knew
   Wat mischief it began to brew.
   Anâ€™ news he spread abaat the taan
   Wat lots oâ€™ rain wud tumble daan
   Anâ€™ like his anshent sires he spoke
   The shockin news withaat a joak.

   For soin the rain iâ€™ torrent fell,
   And o what awful news to tell,
   It lookt as claads wur baan to shutter,
   For every dyke, anâ€™ ditch, anâ€™ gutter,
   A regeler deluge did resemble.
   Which made the Haworth folk to tremble.
   Sum tried to stop its course wiâ€™ stones,
   Anâ€™ sum dropt on their marrow bones,
   Anâ€™ hoped that if the world wur draaned,
   The railway wud be saafe anâ€™ saand.

   But prayers like theas hed no avail,
   For thâ€™ waters deluged all the vale;
   Anâ€™ thâ€™ latest news â€™at I heerd
   Thâ€™ railwayâ€™s nearly disappearâ€™d;
   But if itâ€™s fun withaat a flaw,
   Wha, folks, Iâ€™m like to let you know.



CHAPTER III.


    â€œWork, Boys, and be Contented.â€

Ha, itâ€™s all varry weel for thâ€™ poit to sing that, but if he hed a
railway at stake he wud happen alter his tune, anâ€™ espeshully if he wur
an eye witness nah, for thâ€™ storm wur raginâ€™ at thâ€™ heyest, anâ€™ thâ€™ folks
wur waiting wiâ€™ pashent expectashun to know whether it wur baan to be at
an end or nut, for thâ€™ flooid wur cuminâ€™ daan thicker an faster, anâ€™
thare lookâ€™d to be monny hundred mile oâ€™ watter in thâ€™ valley.
Hawsumever thay musterâ€™d all thâ€™ energy thay could, for thay wur
determined to know thâ€™ worst, so thay went to see if thay could find thâ€™
oud weather-gazer, at hed proffesied thâ€™ flooid; anâ€™ after a good deal oâ€™
runninâ€™ abaat, thay fan him peepinâ€™ throo summat at shap of a tunnil, sum
sed he wur lookinâ€™ at mooin, others sed he wur lookinâ€™ into futurity,
hawsumever thay axt him to cum daan anâ€™ look at thâ€™ railway, anâ€™ tell â€™em
whether thâ€™ flooid wur baan to tak it away or not, but thâ€™ saucy oud
haand refused at first, for he sed at he wur flaid at sum on em wodnâ€™t be
able to stand thâ€™ shock if he tellâ€™d em thâ€™ warst, so the oud lad sed,

   If my advice yo want, poor things,
      Anâ€™ cannot do withaat it,
   Go arm yorseln to thâ€™ teeth, he sed,
      Anâ€™ doant be long abaat it;
   Both rakes anâ€™ powls anâ€™ props anâ€™ ropes
      Yo cannot get ta sooin,
   Anâ€™ take the Cowinheadersâ€™ plan
      When thay discovered thâ€™ mooin.
   Doant gape abaat, but when armâ€™d
      Tak each a different rowt,
   Anâ€™ let yor cry be ivery man,
      Thâ€™ poor railwayâ€™s up the spout.

It wurnt long afore thay gat armâ€™dâ€”sum wiâ€™ clothes props, muk forks,
ropes anâ€™ so on, anâ€™ thare wur sum competition yo mind, for thay wur all
tryin wich cud mak best movement so as thay cud immortalise thair names
it thâ€™ history of Haworth, for thare wur wun Joe Hobb, a handloom weaver,
browt his slay boards, and as he wur goinâ€™ daan thâ€™ hill he did mak sum
manÅ“vures yo mind, for talk abaat fugal men iâ€™ thâ€™ army wen thay throw
thair guns up into thâ€™ air anâ€™ catches em agean, thay wur nowt ta Joe,
for he span his slay boards up anâ€™ daan just like a shuttlecock.  But wal
this wur goinâ€™ on thâ€™ storm began to abate, and thâ€™ water seemed to get
less, but still thay kept at it.  Wal at last a chap at thay called Dave
Twirler shaated aat at he saw summat, and thay lookâ€™t way at he pointed,
and thare behold it wur won oâ€™thâ€™ ribs oâ€™thâ€™ railway stickinâ€™ up, here a
dead silence tuk place which lasted for abaat three haars, for nobody
durst oppen thair maath, flaid at thâ€™ wind wud mak thâ€™ current stronger,
anâ€™ sum oâ€™thâ€™ wimmen held thair tungs to that pain and misery wal thair
stockings fell down ower thair clog tops; but hasumever thâ€™ silence wur
brokken by a Haworth Parish chap â€™at they call Bob Gimlet, he happenâ€™d to
be thare anâ€™ he said, na lads, look daan thâ€™ valley, for I think I see
thâ€™ skeleton at ony rate, anâ€™ Bob wur reight, for it wur as plain to be
seen as an elephant in a shop winder.

   Anâ€™ this wur a fact, it wur thâ€™ railway thay saw,
   Anâ€™ at thâ€™ first oâ€™thâ€™ spectre thay all stood in awe,
   For it wur smashed all iâ€™ pieces ashamed to be seen
   As tho it hed passed throo a sausidge masheen,
   Wiâ€™ horror sum fainted while others took fits,
   Anâ€™ theas â€™at cud stand it wir piking up thâ€™ bits.

   But after a while when thay all becum calm,
   Thay gathered together like bees in a swarm,
   Resolved to pick up all thâ€™ fragments anâ€™ thâ€™ wood,
   Anâ€™ splice â€™em together as weel as thay cud,
   Hasumever thay started a putting it streight,
   Anâ€™ wi spelking and braying thay soin made it reight.

   Six months nah elapsed, anâ€™ thâ€™ gert job wur done,
   Anâ€™ thâ€™ next thing to argue wur wen it sud run;
   So thay sent Joe a Stirks araand wi his bell,
   Anâ€™ gave him strict orders at he wur to tell
   At thâ€™ inspector hed been anâ€™ examined it throo,
   Anâ€™ cum to thâ€™ conclusion at thâ€™ railway wud do.

   So to wark wiâ€™ a vengeance, the bellman set to
   To warn up a meeting at thâ€™ Black Bull,
   It wod a dun yo all good to hear Joey shaat,
   For thay heard him distinctly for miles all abaat,
   For iâ€™ less ner ten minits, thay flockt so fast,
   While Jonny Brothâ€™s horses thay cudnt get past.

   So thay framed on wiâ€™ thâ€™ meeting anâ€™ thâ€™ chairman spak first,
   Anâ€™ tellâ€™d â€™em at thâ€™ railway wur finishâ€™d at last,
   Anâ€™ declared at thâ€™ inspector hed passed when he cum
   Both viaducts anâ€™ bridges as saand as a plum;
   As for sinkinâ€™ agean thay wud do nowt oâ€™thâ€™ sort,
   For thay sailed throo thâ€™ arches iâ€™ Marriner Boat.

   So he hoped iâ€™ this meeting thay all wud agree,
   Anâ€™ settle when thâ€™ oppening oâ€™thâ€™ railway sud be,
   He thout for his part tho he nobbut wur one,
   At first day oâ€™ April wur tâ€™ fittest to run,
   Wen a voice sed, sit daan or Iâ€™ll pelt thee wi spoils,
   Duz ta think at wur baan to be April foils?

   Then up on to thâ€™ platform jumpâ€™d Red Dicky Brook,
   Along wi his uncle, Black Tom at Dyke Nook,
   Determined to sattle anâ€™ bring things araand,
   As thâ€™ railway wur finished, both proper anâ€™ saand;
   So thay pitched on a day, it wur April the fourth,
   To oppen thâ€™ grand railway fra Lundon to Haworth.

   It wur carried as usual, bi thâ€™ showinâ€™ oâ€™ hands,
   Amidst great rejoicinâ€™ an playinâ€™ oâ€™ bands,
   Both oud men anâ€™ wimen had a smile on thair face,
   For all wur dead certain it wur baan to takâ€™ place,
   So thay fled to thair homes like bees to a hive,
   Impashent anâ€™ ankshus for thâ€™ day to arrive.

   Hasumever thâ€™ day at wur menshunâ€™d before,
   Anâ€™ folk wur all flockinâ€™ fro maantan anâ€™ thâ€™ moor,
   Anâ€™ little thay thout wen thay set off that morn,
   Another disaster wud laff â€™em to scorn,
   For Joe Stick wur sent out to tell â€™em to stop
   For poor Haworth Railway hed gotten iâ€™ pop.

   Na this wur a damper anâ€™ thâ€™ biggest iâ€™thâ€™ lot,
   An thâ€™ folks thay declared it wur Keighla plot,
   But one Jack oâ€™ Ludges sed heâ€™d stop â€™em thair prate,
   Heâ€™a learn â€™em iâ€™ Keighla to insinuate,
   Thayâ€™st hev no excurshuns for nowt but thair lip,
   And Shipla anâ€™ Bradford shud hev the first trip.

   He sed heâ€™d been quiet, but heâ€™d na interfere,
   Heâ€™d wauk up to Derby an tell â€™em up thear,
   Ha thay hed been skitted sin first they begun,
   Anâ€™ na wen thâ€™ wur finished thay wurnâ€™t to run;
   But ha he went on I never did hear,
   But one thing Iâ€™m certain he must a been thear.

   For thâ€™ tenth day of April bills wur put aat,
   That thâ€™ railway wud oppen whithaat any daat,
   Anâ€™ a famous excurshun fra Bradford wod run,
   An call at all thâ€™ stashuns wi thâ€™ excepshun oâ€™ won,
   For nowt aat oâ€™ Keighla to Haworth sud ride,
   For that day all thaâ€™ luggage wur left oâ€™ won side.

   Scarce Keighla crookt leggâ€™d ens hed heard oâ€™ the news
   Anâ€™ wur just baan to give â€™em the greatest abuse,
   Wen a order cum aat fra sum unknawn scource,
   That Keighla crookt leggâ€™d ens cud go up of course,
   Thay thout it wur best, anâ€™ wud cause the least bother,
   For one sud be welcum as weel as another.

   Hasumever thare hopes hes not been iâ€™ vain,
   For thâ€™ dayâ€™s arrived anâ€™ yonderâ€™s train,
   Anâ€™ thaasands oâ€™ folks are flocking to thâ€™ spot,
   Thâ€™ gent fra his hall, thâ€™ peasant fra his cot,
   For all are determined as thâ€™ weather is fine,
   To hev an excurshun up thâ€™ Worth Valley Line.

   They land up iâ€™ Haworth, anâ€™ sports â€™at is seen,
   Wur niver yet equalled it reign oâ€™ the Queen.
   Such processions wi music yo never saw thâ€™ like,
   Thay wur bands fra all nashuns excepting Black Dyke,
   Anâ€™ Sham oâ€™ Blue Bells sed heâ€™d kick up a shine,
   For na they hed oppenâ€™d the Worth Valley Line.

   Thare wur Jim oâ€™thâ€™ Damems, anâ€™ Will oâ€™thâ€™ Gooise Coit,
   Anâ€™ thâ€™ lads at wur in that puddin exploit,
   Thare wur Ned daan fra Oakworth, anâ€™ Ike fra Loin-ends,
   Along wi thair aristocratical friends,
   They repaired to Black Bull, of saand puddinâ€™ to dine,
   That day at thay oppenâ€™d thâ€™ Worth Valley Line.

   Iâ€™ all nooks anâ€™ corners anâ€™ chimla tops,
   Wur floatinâ€™ gert banners wi mighty big props,
   Anâ€™ stampt on each flag in figurs so nice,
   Sum an inscripshun anâ€™ sum a device;
   But thâ€™ nicest iâ€™thâ€™ lump at swung on a band
   Wur, welcum to Haworth fra ivery land.

   Yor welcum, yor welcum, all men upon earth,
   Yor welcum to the Valley of Worth,
   Fra thâ€™ Humber to thâ€™ Mersey, fra thâ€™ Thames daan to thâ€™ Tyne,
   Yor welcum to travel the Worth Valley Line.



CHAPTER IV.


    â€œThe last Scene of all that ends this strange, eventful history.â€

_Fra thâ€™ Corrispondant oâ€™thâ€™ Hoylus End Mercury_.

   Good folks, youâ€™ve inkwired at home and abroad,
   Ha weâ€™re gettinâ€™ on wi wur famous railroad;
   And wen Iâ€™ve tellâ€™d yo thâ€™ disasters weâ€™ve hed,
   Yoâ€™ve greevâ€™d monny a time wal yoâ€™ve tain to yor bed,
   But ha yo will gape wen yo read farther daan,
   Wat famons big stirrins weâ€™ve hed up iâ€™thâ€™ taan.

   I know yoâ€™d be mad as soin as yo heard,
   Abaat that oud kaa at belonged to Blue Beard,
   For I like as I saw yo just hod of its tail,
   And braying it rump wi thâ€™ end oâ€™ yor flail;
   For I wisht monny a time at yoâ€™d been here,
   For swallowing thâ€™ plan yoâ€™d a geen it wat cheer.

   Ha iver, good folk, Iâ€™ll try to be breef,
   For I know yoâ€™re iâ€™ pain and Iâ€™ll give yo releefâ€”
   So to tell yo the truth in a plain honest way,
   Thâ€™ railroad is finishâ€™d an oppenâ€™d to-day;
   Anâ€™ Iâ€™ve tain up mi pen, for ill yoâ€™d a tainâ€™t
   If I hednâ€™t a geen yo a truthful ackaant.

   Hasumever, this morning as I tellâ€™d yo before,
   I wur wakkenâ€™d wi hearin a awful uproar,
   Wat wi thâ€™ prating oâ€™ women anâ€™ shaating oâ€™thâ€™ folk,
   Anâ€™ thâ€™ bells â€™at wur ringin, it wur past ony joke,
   For ivery two minits thay shaated huray,
   We are na baan to oppen thâ€™ Haworth Railway.

   So I jumpâ€™d up iâ€™ bed, anâ€™ I gat on the floor,
   I slipt on mi cloas anâ€™ ran aat door,
   Anâ€™ thâ€™ first at I met, it wur one Jimmy Peg,
   Heâ€™d cumâ€™d up fra Bockin an brout a gert fleg,
   Anâ€™ just at his heels wur thâ€™ Spring-headed band,
   Playing a marchâ€”I thout it wur grand.

   So I fell into thâ€™ step for I knaw how to march,
   For Iâ€™ve been stiffenâ€™d up wiâ€™ guvernment starch;
   Anâ€™ first smell oâ€™ music it makes me fair dance
   Anâ€™ I prick us mi ears like a trooper his lance,
   Hasumever, I thout as Iâ€™d gotten the scent,
   Iâ€™d follow this music wharever it went.

   Then I marchâ€™d up erect, wal I cum to thâ€™ grand stand,
   Anâ€™ that wur at thâ€™ stashun whare thâ€™ train hed to land
   Thare wur flags of all nations, fra thâ€™ Union Jack
   To Bacchus anâ€™ Atlas wiâ€™ thâ€™ globe on his back,
   For thâ€™ Inspector and Conductor, and all sorls oâ€™ fray,
   Wur expected directly to land at thâ€™ railway.

   So I stared until both een wur varry near bleared,
   Anâ€™ waited anâ€™ waitedâ€”at last it appeared,
   It wur filled full oâ€™ folk as eggs full oâ€™ meat,
   Anâ€™ it tuk four engines to bring it up reight,
   Two hed long chimlas anâ€™ tuther hed noan,
   But thay stuck weel together like a dog to a boan.

   They wur gruntinâ€™ anâ€™ growlinâ€™ wur thâ€™ folk at gat aat,
   So I made sum inquiries wat it wur abaat;
   For iâ€™ all mi born days I neâ€™er heard nowt so called,
   For three or four times thay sed it hed stallâ€™d
   Wal sum oâ€™thâ€™ crookt-leggâ€™d ens bethout of a scheam,
   Anâ€™ thay went back to Keighla for a hamper oâ€™ steam.

   Anâ€™ my word anâ€™ honner, it did mak a gert din,
   For I stud by and heard it anâ€™ saw it cum in;
   I expected it cummin as quiet as a lamb,
   But no daat aâ€™thâ€™ noises wur nobbut a sham;
   But watâ€™s thâ€™ use oâ€™ tellin yo ha it did cum,
   Iâ€™d forgotten yoâ€™d ridden to Wibsey begum.

   Thare wur fifty iâ€™ number invited to dine,
   All us at hed acted reight loyal to thâ€™ line;
   Sa I thout that Iâ€™d go, for I knew weel enuff
   â€™At thâ€™ puddings this time wud be made oâ€™thâ€™ reight stuff
   And noan oâ€™ that stuffment that gav thâ€™ Keighla band,
   Toan awf on it rubbish and tother awf sand.

   For twelve stone oâ€™ flour (3lbs. to a man)
   Wur boiled iâ€™ oud Bingleechinâ€™s kaa lickin pan,
   Wi gert lumps oâ€™ sewet at thâ€™ cook hed put inâ€™t,
   At shane like a ginney just new aat oâ€™thâ€™ mint;
   Wi nives made a purpos to cut it iâ€™ rowls,
   Anâ€™ thâ€™ sauce wur iâ€™ buckets, an mighty big bowls.

   They wur chattin anâ€™ tawkin anâ€™ sucking ther spice,
   Anâ€™ crackin at dainties thay thout â€™at wur nice,
   Wal thâ€™ oud parson gat up and pulled a long face,
   Anâ€™ mutterâ€™d sum words â€™at thay call sayinâ€™ thâ€™ grace,
   But I niver goamâ€™d that, cos I knew for a fact
   It wur nobbut a signal for thâ€™ puddin attack.

   And Iâ€™ll tell yo wat, folk, tho yo maint beleeve,
   But yo tawk abaat Wibsey folk heytin horse beef,
   Yo sud a seen Locker taaners brandishinâ€™ thair nives,
   Anâ€™ choppin and cuttin thair wallopin shives,
   Anâ€™ all on em shaating thay liked thâ€™ puddin thâ€™ best,
   For nowt wur like thâ€™ puddin for standin the test.

   And while thay wur cuttin anâ€™ choppin away,
   The gallant Spring-headers wur orderâ€™d to play,
   But thay didnâ€™t much like it for every one
   Wur flaid at thayâ€™d play wal thâ€™ puddin wur done;
   But as luck wur they ticed em, wi a gert deal to do,
   To play Roger the plowman and Rozzen the Bow.

   Hasumiver thay played anâ€™ thay drummed up agean,
   Anâ€™ thâ€™ drummer he struck wi his might and his mane,
   Anâ€™ Iâ€™m like to confess I wur niver war flaid,
   For thay put such a stress on to all â€™at thay played,
   But I kept mysel quiet, cos I knewâ€™t wur a sin,
   To stop such grand music, if thâ€™ roof tumbled in.

   Ike Ouden wur chairman at com to preside,
   Anâ€™ Will Thompson oâ€™ Guiseley wur set by his side;
   Na Willâ€™s a director oâ€™thâ€™ Midland line,
   Anâ€™ as dacent a chap as sat daan ta dine,
   Along wi Jim Sugden at held the vice chair,
   Wur one Billy Brayshaw, Bradford Lord Mayor.

   Thare wur Jonathan Craven, Mic Morrell and me,
   And a lot more lads at wur on fur a spree;
   Thare wur Nedwin oâ€™ Georgeâ€™s and Pete Featherstone,
   They sat side by side like Darby and Joan!
   Anâ€™ I hardly can tell yo, but yor noan to a shade,
   But I knaw thay wur Ingham and little Jack Wade.

   Na thâ€™ dinner bein ower thay shifted all thâ€™ tins,
   Then thâ€™ chairman stud up like a man on his pins,
   And proposinâ€™ a bumper to Englandâ€™s gooid Queen,
   He telled what a kind-hearted monark shooâ€™d been,
   At shooâ€™d trained up her family in her own loyal way,
   â€™At thâ€™ Crown Prince wur thâ€™ best rider iâ€™ Haworth to-day.

   Thâ€™ toast it being honnered, then the chairman went on,
   And tellâ€™d wat gert wonders oud England hed dun;
   As for invading armies shooâ€™d nothing to fear
   As long as thâ€™ bold 42nd wur thear,
   But heâ€™d leave that aside, for heâ€™d summat to say
   Abaat his attachment to Haworth Railway,

   So, he says, be silent all thâ€™ folk iâ€™ this hall,
   So, as any one on yo can hear a pin fall,
   And John oâ€™ Bill Olders, just shut up thi prate,
   For Iâ€™ve summat to say an I mun let it aat;
   For I mun hev silence whatever betide,
   Or Iâ€™ll cum aat oâ€™thâ€™ loom and sum on ya hide.

   Three years hes elapsed anâ€™ weâ€™re going on thâ€™ fourth,
   Sin we first started thâ€™ railway fra Keighley to Haworth;
   Wat wi dreaminâ€™ by neet anâ€™ workinâ€™ by day,
   Itâ€™s been to poor Haworth a dearish railway,
   Anâ€™ monny a time Iâ€™ve been aat a patience,
   Wi thâ€™ host oâ€™ misfortunes and miscalculations.

   Thâ€™ first do at we hed wur thâ€™ kaa swallowing thâ€™ plan,
   Anâ€™d then wur bad luck anâ€™ misfortunes began;
   For before Ginger Jabus cud draw us anuther,
   All went on wrong anâ€™ weâ€™d a gert deal oâ€™ bother;
   He must haâ€™ been dreamin, a silly oud claan,
   For three fields oâ€™ Doodleâ€™s he never put daan.

   But Jack Metcauf put up wiâ€™ that for he sed heâ€™d allah
   â€™At thâ€™ misfortune wur caused wi thâ€™ greedy oud kaa;
   So be set all his navvies agate in a hig,
   Anâ€™ thay upset a chapel at thâ€™ Paper Mill Brig;
   Na thâ€™ folk droppâ€™d thair lugs an wur daan oâ€™thâ€™ Railway,
   But we gat ower that bit wiâ€™ hevinâ€™ to pay.

   Nah Ike finished off in his dashinâ€™ oud way,
   Anâ€™ thâ€™ folk wur all shaatinâ€™, hear, hear! and hurra,
   For heigher and heigher the band it wur playinâ€™,
   Anâ€™ nobody cud hear a word thay wur sayinâ€™,
   For thâ€™ clappinâ€™ anâ€™ shaatinâ€™ it lasted awhile,
   For I clapped wal mi hands wur as sore as a bile.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
