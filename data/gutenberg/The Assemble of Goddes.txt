[Transcriber's note: Until recently this work was attributed to John
Lydgate, but now most scholars consider that the author is unknown. The
first mention of Lydgate's authorship of this work was made by Stephen
Hawes in 1505 as one of Lydgate's seven major works. But many scholars
have doubted over the years that this poem was written by Lydgate,
because the style used doesn't greatly resemble the style of Lydgate's
other works, and the vocabulary is somewhat more modern than Lydgate is
known to have used. Modern scholars believe that this work was written
between 1478 and 1483 (about forty years after Lydgate's death).
Analysis of style and vocabulary have led scholars to conclude that the
author might have been a woman. For further information about this poem
please see The Assembly of Gods, edited by Jane Chance, published by
Medieval Institute Publications, Kalamazoo, Michigan, 1999, ISBN:
1580440223, which is also available online at
http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/asint.htm.

The book from which this e-book was transcribed is a fascimile reprint
of the third printing of this book, made by Wynkyn de Worde circa 1500.
The book was printed in blackletter font known as Wynkyn de Worde's type
3, and uses many abbreviations, which I have expanded and rendered
inside parenthesis, eg., {x}. The abbreviations used in this book are:

  *Macron over the letter. The most common one, usually meaning
    missing "n" or "m" after the letter. But in some cases might also
    mean missing "e," "er" or "re" after the letter. This happens
    usually when p, q or r have macrons.
  *Little e over Middle-English thorn, meaning "the."
  *Little t over Middle-English thorn, meaning "that."
  *Little u over Middle-English thorn, meaning "thou."
  *Little t over w, meaning "with."
  *Middle-English yogh, representing "gh."
  *Superscripted 9 after letter, meaning missing "us." Used only at
    the end of the word.
  *Superscripted 2 after letter, meaning missing "e," "er" or "re."
    Used only at the end of the word.
  *Stretched s, looking like integral sign, meaning missing "e" or "i"
    before letter s.
  *Dot over the letter, meaning missing "e," "er" or "re" after the
    letter. Usually used with d, t, e and u. Combination q+d with dot
    means "quod."
  *Strike through letter, meaning missing "e," "er" or "re" after the
    letter. Usually used with p, v and s. Striked through p might also
    mean missing "ro" or "or" after p.

Occasionally there were some letters printed upside down. I have
rendered them inside brackets, e.g., [x]. The poem uses two types of
punctuation--a dot, meaning longer pause, and a slash, meaning shorter
pause or comma. I have corrected many errors and noted them on a right
margin. Also this printing was missing three lines and one line had
several letters missing from the middle of the line. I have marked them
on a right margin and the correct reading supplied from the modern
edition. There were a couple of places where the word "nota" or "note"
was printed, but the actual notes weren't found in this reprint. There's
a fair chance that those notes were never printed. The original page
images are available with html edition.]




The assemble of goddes
by
John Lydgate


Printed at Westminster
by Wynkyn de Worde about the year
1500


Cambridge
at the University Press
1906




The work here reprinted formed part of the famous volume of black-letter
tracts (formerly marked AB. 4. 58), which came to the University Library
in 1715 by the gift of King George the First with the rest of the
library of John Moore, Bishop of Ely. No other copy of this edition is
recorded to be in existence.

The types used are Caxton's type 3 (for the title) and Wynkyn de Worde's
type 3, with final m and n etc. from type 1 (in the rest of the book).
This type 3 is not known to have been used before 1499.

Mr Sayle remarks that the woodcut illustration is taken from Caxton's
second edition (ab. 1483-4) of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.

    Â¶ I was fayne to drawe to myne habytacle.
    Â¶ To rowne {with} a pylow me semyd best tryacle.
    Â¶ So leyde I me downe my dysease to releue.
    Â¶ Anone cam in Morpleus & toke me by {the} sleue

    Â¶ And as I soo laye halfe in a traunse
    Â¶ Twene slepyng & wakyng he bad me aryse.
    Â¶ For he sayd I must yeue attendaunce.
    Â¶ To the grete Courte of Mynes the Iustyse.
    Â¶ Me nought auayled ayene hym to sylogyse.
    Â¶ For hit is oft sayd by hem that yet lyues.
    Â¶ He must nedes go that the deuell dryues.

    Â¶ Whan I see noo better but I must go.
    Â¶ I sayd I was redy at his co{m}maundement.
    Â¶ Wheder that he wolde me lede to or fro.
    Â¶ Soo vp I arose and forth with hym went.
    Â¶ Tyll he had me brought to the parlament.
    Â¶ Where Pluto sate and kepte is estate.
    Â¶ And with hym Mynos the Iuge desperate.

    Â¶ But as we thyderwarde went by the way.
    Â¶ I hym besought his name me to tell.
    Â¶ Morpleus he sayde thou me call may.
    Â¶ A syr sayde I than where do ye dwell.
    Â¶ In heuen or in erthe eyther elles in hell.
    Â¶ Nay he sayde myn abydyng most commonly
    Â¶ Is in a lytyll corner called fantasy.

    Â¶ And as sone as he thyse wordes had sayd.
    Â¶ Cerberus the porter of hell {with} his cheyne.
    Â¶ Brought theder Colus i{n} ragges euyll arayd
    Â¶ Agay{n} whom Neptun{us} & Dyana dyd co{m}pley{n}t     Original has

    Â¶ {That} we may haue cause to preyse thy lord Pluto     co{m}pley{n}t

    Â¶ Then was there made a proclamacyon.
    Â¶ In Plutoos name co{m}maunded scylence.
    Â¶ Vpon the payn of strayt correccyon.
    Â¶ {That} Dyana & Neptun{us} might haue audience.
    Â¶ To declare her grefe of the grete offence.
    Â¶ To hem do by Colus wheron they co{m}pleined
    Â¶ And to begyn Dyana was constreyned.

    Â¶ Whyche thus begyn as ye shall here.
    Â¶ Saynge in this wyse. O thou lorde Pluto.
    Â¶ Wyth thy iuge Mynos syttyng {with} the in fere

    Â¶ Wherfore a remedy puruey in haste.
    Â¶ And lete hym be punysshed after his offence.
    Â¶ Cousyder the cryme and yeue your sentence.

    Â¶ And whan Dyana had made her compley{n}t

    Â¶ And so euenly dele twene thise partyey twein
    Â¶ That none of he{m} haue case on {the} other co{m}pleint

    Â¶ Thenne sayd mynos full indyfferently.
    Â¶ To Dyana & Neptunus is there ony more.
    Â¶ That ye wyll declare ageyn hym openly.
    Â¶ Nay in dede they sayd we kepe none in store /

    Â¶ Saaf vertu a litil before the felde had gete.
    Â¶ And ellis his aua{n}tage forsoth had be ful lyght
    Â¶ Not for then encombred so was neuer wyght.
    Â¶ As vertu & his men were with the ranke wede
    Â¶ That in {the} felde grew of sensualitees sede

    Â¶ But as soone as vyce of vertu had a syght.
    Â¶ He gan swage gonnes as he had be woode
    Â¶ That heryng vertu co{m}maunded euery wyght
    Â¶ To pauyce hym vnder the sygne of {the} rode.
    Â¶ And bad he{m} not drede but kepe styll where thy stode.
    Â¶ It was but a shour shold sone co{n}fou{n}de
    Â¶ wherfore he co{m}mau{n}ded the{m} sta{n}d & kepe her grou{n}d

    Â¶ And whan vyce cam nerer to the felde.
    Â¶ He callyd sore for bowes & bad hem shote faste
    Â¶ But vertu & hys meyny bare of with {the} sheld.
    Â¶ Of the blyssyd Trynyte ay tyll shot was past.
    Â¶ And wha{n} shot was done vyce cam forth at last.
    Â¶ Purposyng the felde wyth assaute to wyn.
    Â¶ But v{er}tu kept it long he myght not ent{er} theryn.

    Â¶ All that tyme Frewyll stode & hym bethought.
    Â¶ To which he my{gh}t leue & what p{ar}t he wold take.
    Â¶ At last sensualite had hy{m} so fer brought.
    Â¶ That he sayd playnly he v{er}tu wold forsake.
    Â¶ And in vyce hys quarell all his power make.
    Nota Iwis quod reason {that} is not for the beste.
    Â¶ Noforse sayd frewyll I wyll do as my lyst.

    Â¶ Vertu was full heuy when he see frewyll
    Â¶ Take part with vyce but yet neuerthelesse.
    Â¶ He dyde that he myght the felde to kepe styll.
    Â¶ Tyll vyce with frewyll so sore gan hy{m} oppresse.
    Â¶ That he was constrayned clerely by duresse.           Original has
    Â¶ A lytyll tyne abacke to make abew retret.             constranyed
    Â¶ All thyng consydered hit was the best feet.           instead of
                                                            constrayned
    Â¶ Fyrst to remembre how vyce parte was.
    Â¶ Ten ayen one strenger by lyklynesse.
    Â¶ And than how frewyll was with hym alas.
    Â¶ Whoo coude deme vertu but in heuynesse.
    Â¶ Moreouer to thynke how that slyper grasse.
    Â¶ That of sensualyte hys onkynde seede grew.
    Â¶ Vnder foot in standyng encombred vertew

    Â¶ Yet notwitstondyng vertue his men all.
    Â¶ Nobelly theym bare and faught myghtyly.
    Â¶ How be it {the} sleper grasse made many of he{m} fall.
    Â¶ And from thense in maner departe sodenly.
    Â¶ That seyng vyce his hoost began to shout & cry.
    Â¶ And sayd on in Pluto name on & all is oureÂ·
    Â¶ For this day shal Vyce be made a conquerour.

    Â¶ Thus Vertu was by myght of vyce & Frewyll
    Â¶ Dryuen out of the feld it was the more pyteÂ·
    Â¶ How by it yet Baptym kept his ground styll.
    Â¶ And {with} hym abode feyth hope & vnyte.
    Â¶ And konnynge also {with} a grete meyne.
    Â¶ Confessyon contrycyon were redy at her hond.
    Â¶ And Satysfaction Vyce to wythstond.

    Â¶ But al the tyme whyle Vertu was away.
    Â¶ A my{gh}ty conflycte kept they {with} Vycys rout.
    Â¶ And yet neuertheles for al that grete afray.
    Â¶ Hope stod vpryght & feyth wold neuer lout
    Â¶ And euermor{e} sayd Baptym syres put no dout.
    Â¶ Vertu shal return & haue his entent.
    Â¶ This feld shal be ours or let me be shent.

    Â¶ And whyl thyse pety captey{n}s sustend th{us} {the} feld
    Â¶ Wyth Vertu his reward come good p{er}seuerauns
    Â¶ An hugy my{gh}ty hoost & whan he beheld.
    Â¶ How Vertu hym withdrew he toke dysplesau{n}s.
    Â¶ And wha{n} he to hy{m} cam he sayd ye shal your cha{n}s
    Â¶ Take as it fallyth wherfore returne ye must.          Original has
    Â¶ Yet ones for your sake {with} Vyce shal I Iust.       fallyrh
                                                            instead of
    Â¶ Alas that euer ye shold lese your honour.             fallyth
    Â¶ And therwyth also {the} hygh p{er}petuel crown.
    Â¶ Which is for you kept in the celestyal tour.
    Â¶ Wherfore be ye called chrystys champyon.
    Â¶ How is it that ye haue noo compassyone.
    Â¶ On baptyme feyth & hope konnyng & vnite.
    Â¶ That sta{n}d so hard bestad & fyght as ye may see.

    Â¶ All the tresour erthely vnder {the} fyrmame{n}t
    Â¶ That euer was made of goddys creacyon.
    Â¶ To reward theym euenly were not equyualent.
    Â¶ For her noble labour in his affleccyon.
    Â¶ Wherfore take vpon you your Iurisdyccyon
    Â¶ Rescu yonder knyghtes & recontynu fyght.
    Â¶ And els a dew your crown for al your gret my{gh}t

    Â¶ Vith these & suche wordys as I haue you tolde
    Â¶ By good perseueraunce vttred in this wyse.
    Â¶ Vertu hym remembred & gan to vexe bolde.
    Â¶ And sayd yeue trew knyghtis to rescu I auyse
    Â¶ Let vs no lengar tary from this entrepryse.
    Â¶ Agayn to {the} felde soo Vertu retourned.
    Â¶ That caused he{m} be mery {that} lo{n}g afore had morned

    Â¶ Auaunt baner q{uo}d he in {the} name of Iesu
    Â¶ And with {that} his people set vp a gret shoute.
    Â¶ And cryed with a loude voce a Vertu a Vertu.
    Â¶ Then began Vyce his hoost for to loke a boute.
    Â¶ But I trow p{er}seuerau{n}ce was not long withoute
    Â¶ He bathed his swerd in his foos blood.
    Â¶ The boldest of hem all not ones hy{m} withstoode.

    Â¶ Constau{n}ce hym folowed & brought hy{m} his spere
    Â¶ But when p{er}seuerau{n}ce saw Vyce on his stede.
    Â¶ No man coude hym let tyll he came there.
    Â¶ For to byd hym ryde I trow it was no nede.
    Â¶ All Vertu his oost prayed for his good spede.
    Â¶ Agayn Vyce he rode with his grete shaft.
    Â¶ And hym ouerthrew for all his sotyll craft.

    Â¶ That seyng Frewill came to conscyence.
    Â¶ And gan hym to repente {that} he with hym had be.
    Â¶ Prayeng hym of cou{n}sell for his grete offence.
    Â¶ That he agayn Vertu had made his arme.
    Â¶ What was best to doo to humylyte:
    Â¶ Q{uo}d conscyence must {thou} go so he hym thyder sent
    Â¶ Dysguysed {that} he were not knowen as he wente.

    Â¶ And whan he thyder came humylyte hym toke.
    Â¶ A token & bad hym go to conffessyon.
    Â¶ And shew hym his mater with a peteous loke
    Â¶ Whiche done he hym sent to contrycyon.
    Â¶ And fro thensforthe to satysfaccyon.
    Â¶ Thus fro poost to pyler was he made to dau{n}ce.
    Â¶ And at the last he went forthe to penau{n}ce.

    Â¶ But now for to tel you whe{n} Vyce was ou{er}throw
    Â¶ A gret part of his oost about hym gan resorte.
    Â¶ But he was so febyll {that} he coude noman know.
    Â¶ And whan they se {that} they knew no comforte.
    Â¶ But caryed hym away be a preuy porte.
    Â¶ And as they caryed dyspeyre with hy{m} met.
    Â¶ With Vyce his rewarde he cam theym for to fet

    Â¶ Then came there downe goodly ladyes tweyn.
    Â¶ From the hyghe heuen aboue the fyrmamente.
    Â¶ And sayd the gret Alpha & Oo moost souereyn.
    Â¶ For that nobell tryumphe had hem thyder sent.
    Â¶ One of hem to dryue Vyce to grete tormente.
    Â¶ With a fyry strong {that} she bare in her hande.
    Â¶ And so he dede dyspere & all his hole bande.

    Â¶ The name of this lady was called Prestyence.
    Â¶ She neuer left Vyce ne none {that} wolde hy{m} folow.
    Â¶ Tyll they were co{m}mytted by {the} dyuyne sentence.
    Â¶ All to payne perpetuell & Infynyte sorow.
    Â¶ Right wysnes went to se {that} noma{n} shold he{m} borow.
    Â¶ Th{us} al entreted sharpely were they tyll Cerber{us}
    Â¶ Had hem beshut within his gates tenebr{us}.

    Â¶ And all {the} whyle {that} Prestye{n}ce {with} her scorge smert
    Â¶ To rewarde Vyce gan her thus occupy.
    Â¶ With all his hole bende after her desert.
    Â¶ That other gloryo{us} lady {that} came fro heue{n} on hy.
    Â¶ Hauyng in her honde the palme of vyctory.
    Â¶ Came downe to Vertu & toke hym to {that} p{re}sent.
    Â¶ Sayeng thus that Alpha & Oo hath hym sent.

    Â¶ And as ferre as I ryght coude vnderstonde
    Â¶ That ladyes name was Predestynacyon.
    Â¶ Vertu & his oost she blessyd with her honde.
    Â¶ And in heuyn graunted hem habytacyon.
    Â¶ Whereto eche of hem reseruyd was a crowne.
    Â¶ She sayd in token that they enherytours.
    Â¶ Of the glory were & gracious conquerours.

    Â¶ Wych done the ladyes ayen to gyder met
    Â¶ And towarde heuen vp they gan to fly
    Â¶ Embraced in armes as they had ben knyt.
    Â¶ Togyd{er} {with} a gyrdyl but so sodenly.
    Â¶ As {the}y wer{e} vanysshyd saw I neu{er} thy{n}g {with} ey.
    Â¶ And anone Vertu wyth al his company.
    Â¶ Kneled dou{n}n & tha{n}ked god of {that} vyctory.

    Â¶ Yet had I forget whan Vyce was ouerthrow.
    Â¶ To haue told you hou many of Vycys hoost.
    Â¶ Gan to seke pease & darked dou{n}n ful low.
    Â¶ And besought mercy what so euer it coste.
    Â¶ To be her mene to Vertu els {the}y we{re} but lost.
    Â¶ And some in lyke wyse to feyth & hope sought.
    Â¶ What to do for pease they sayd they ne rou{gh}te.

    Â¶ Some also Baptym sewed to be her mene.
    Â¶ Som to one som to other as thei he{m} gete my{gh}te.
    Â¶ But al to Confessyon we{n}t to make he{m} clene
    Â¶ And as {the}y came to co{n}sye{n}ce he they{m} bad go ly{gh}te.
    Â¶ Er tha{n} old attropes of he{m} had a sy{gh}t.
    Â¶ For yf he so theym toke lost they we{re} for euer
    Â¶ He sayd Vyce to forsake better late thy{n} neuer.

    Â¶ Som eke for socour drew to circu{m}cision.
    Â¶ But by hy{m} coud they gete but smal fauoure.
    Â¶ For he in that company was had but in derysyo{n}
    Â¶ Neuer{the}lesse to feyth he bad he{m} go laboure.
    Â¶ Prayng they{m} for olde acqueynta{n}ce they{m} socoure
    Â¶ Wel q{uo}d feth for his sake I shal do {that} I may doo
    Â¶ But fyrste for the best way baptym go ye to.

    Â¶ For by hym sonest shal ye recouer grace.
    Â¶ Which shal to Vertu bryng you by processe.
    Â¶ Wherfore in ony wyse loke ye make good face.
    Â¶ And let noman know of your heuynes.
    Â¶ So they were by baptym brou{gh}t out of destres
    Â¶ Turned al to Vertu & whan this was done.
    Â¶ Vertu cu{m}mau{n}ded Frewyl before hym come.

    Â¶ To whom thus he sayd I haue grete merueyl
    Â¶ Ye durst be so bold Vyces party to take.
    Â¶ Who bad you do so & yaue you that counseyl.
    Â¶ Iustly vnto that ye shal me preuy make.
    Â¶ Then sayd Frewyll & swemfully spake.
    Â¶ Knelyng on his kne wyth a chere benygn.               Original has
    Â¶ I pray you syr let pyte your eres to me enclyne.      benyng
                                                            instead of
    Â¶ And I shall yow tel the verrey soth of all.           benygn
    Â¶ How it was & who made me that way drawe.
    Â¶ For soth sensualyte his p{ro}pre name they call.
    Â¶ A sayd reason then I know wel that felowe.
    Â¶ Wyld he is & wanton of me stant hy{m} none awe.
    Â¶ Is he so q{uo}d Vertu wel he shall be taught.
    Â¶ As a player shuld to draw another draught.

    Â¶ And {with} that came sadnesse wyt his sober chere.
    Â¶ Bryngyng Sensualite beyng ful of thought.
    Â¶ And sayd that he had take hym prysonere.
    Â¶ A welcome sayd Vertu now haue I {that} I sou{gh}t.
    Â¶ Blessed be the good lord as {thou} wold it is nought
    Â¶ Why arte {thou} so wanton he sayd for shame.
    Â¶ Or {thou} go at large {thou} shalt be more tame.

    But sto{n}d a part a whyle tyl I haue spoke a word
    Â¶ Wyth Frewyl a lytyl & then shalte {thou} knowe.
    Â¶ What shalbe thy fynau{n}ce & then he sayd in bord
    Â¶ Vnto Frewyl the bend of your bowe.
    Â¶ Begynnyth to slake but suche as ye haue sowe
    Â¶ Must nedes repe there is none waye.
    Â¶ Notwythstondy{n}g that lette what ye can saye.

    Â¶ What is your habilite me to recompense.
    Â¶ For the grete harme that ye to me haue do.
    Â¶ Forsoth sayd Frewyll in open audyence.
    Â¶ But oonly Macrocosme more haue I not loo.
    Â¶ Take {that} yf it pleyse you I wyl that it be soo.
    Â¶ Yf I may vnderstond ye be my good lorde.
    Â¶ In dede sayd Vertu to that wyll I accorde.

    Â¶ Then made Vertu Reason his leyftenaunte.
    Â¶ And yaue hi{m} a grete charge macrocosme to kepe
    Â¶ That done Sensualite yeld hym recreaunte.
    Â¶ And began for anger bytterly to wepe.
    Â¶ For he demed surely hys sorowe shold not slepe
    Â¶ Then made Vertu Frewyll bayl vnd{er} Reason.
    Â¶ The feld for to ocupy to his behoue that season.

    Â¶ And then sayd Vertu to Sensualyte.
    Â¶ Thou shalt be rewarded for thy besynesse.
    Â¶ Vnder this furme al fragylyte
    Â¶ Shalt {thou} forsake both more and lesse.
    Â¶ And vnd{er} the guydy{n}g {thou} shalt be of sadnesse.
    Â¶ All though it somwhat be agayn thy herte.
    Â¶ Thy Iugements gyuen {thou} shalt it not asterte.

    Â¶ And evyn {with} that came in dame Nature.
    Â¶ Sayeng th{us} to Vertu syr ye do me wronge.
    Â¶ By duresse & constreynt to put this creature.
    Â¶ Gentyll Sensualyte {that} hath me s{er}ued longe.
    Â¶ Clerely from his lyberte & set hym amonge.
    Â¶ They{m} that loue hy{m} not to be her vnd{er}loute.
    Â¶ As it were a cast away or a sho cloute.

    Â¶ And perde ye know well a rewle haue I must
    Â¶ Wythin Macrocosme forsoth I say not nay.
    Q{uo}d Vertu but se{n}sualyte shal not p{er}form your lust
    Â¶ Lyke as he hath do befor this yf I may.
    Â¶ Therfro hy{m} restreyn sadnesse shal assay.
    Â¶ How be it ye shal haue your hole lyberte.
    Â¶ Wythin Macrocosme as ye haue had fre.

    Â¶ And whan Vertu had to Nature sayd thus
    Â¶ A lytyll tyne his ey castyng hym besyde.
    Â¶ He se in a corner stondyng Morpleus
    Â¶ That hy{m} before warned of {that} berely tyde.
    Â¶ A syrs sayd Vertu yet we must abyde.
    Â¶ Here is a frend of ours may not be forgete.
    Â¶ After his deserte we shall hy{m} entreate

    Â¶ Morple{us} sayd Vertu I tha{n}ke you hertely
    Â¶ For your trew herte & your grete laboure.
    Â¶ That ye lyst to come to me soo redely.
    Â¶ Whan ye vnderstood {the} comy{n}g of that shoure.
    Â¶ I thanke god & you of sauy{n}g of my{n} honour.
    Â¶ Wherfore this preuylege now to you I gra{n}t
    Â¶ That {with}in Macrocosme ye shall haue your hau{n}t

    Â¶ And of fyue posternes {the} keys shall ye kepe.
    Â¶ Lettyng in & out at hy{m} whome ye lyst.
    Â¶ As long as in Macrocosme your fad{er} wyll crepe.
    Â¶ Blere whos ey ye wyll hardely {with} your myst
    Â¶ And kepe your werkes close there as in a chyst
    Â¶ Saaf I wold desyre you spare Pollucyon.
    For no thy{n}g may me plese {the} sou{n}eth to corrupcyon.

    Â¶ And wha{n} he had th{us} sayd {the} keyes he hy{m} toke.
    Â¶ And toward his castell {with} his people went
    Â¶ Byddy{n}g reason take good hede & about loke
    Â¶ That se{n}sualite by Nature were not she{n}t.
    Â¶ Kepe hy{m} short he sayd tyll his lust be spe{n}t
    Â¶ For better were a chylde to by vnbore
    Â¶ Than let hy{m} haue {the} wyll & foreuer be lore.

    Â¶ And wha{n} olde Attropos had seen & herd all this
    Â¶ How Vertu had opteyned astonyed as he stood.
    Â¶ He sayd to hy{m}selfe somwhat there is amys.
    Â¶ I trow well my patent be not all good.        Next line is missing
    Â¶ Sayeng to the goddys I see ye do but iape.    from the original.
    Â¶ After a worthy whew haue ye made me gape.     The line reads:
                                                    And ran to the palyse
    Â¶ How a deuyll way sholde I Vertue ouerthrow.   as he had be wood
    Â¶ When he dredeth not all your hole route.
    Â¶ How ca{m} ye make good your pate{n}t wold I know
    Â¶ Hit is to Impossable to bryng that aboute.
    Â¶ For stryke hym may I not {that} is out of doute.
    Â¶ A good Attropos sayd god Apollo.
    Â¶ An answere conuenyent shall thou haue herto.

    Â¶ The wordes of thy patent dare I well say
    Â¶ Stretche to no forther but were dame Nature
    Â¶ Hath Iurysdyccyon the{re} to haue the way Nota.
    Â¶ And largesse to stryke as longet to thy cure.
    Â¶ And as for Vertu he his no cryature.
    Â¶ Vnder the predycament conteyned of quantyte
    Â¶ Wherefore his dystruccyon longeth not to the.

    Â¶ A ha sayd Attropos then I see well.
    Â¶ That all ye goddys be but cou{n}terfete.              Original has
    Â¶ For oo God there is that can euerydell.               goodys and
    Â¶ Tourne as hym lest bothe drye & whete.                coue{n}terfete
    Â¶ In to whoos seruyce I shal assay to gete.             instead of
    Â¶ And yf I may ones to his seruyce come.                goddys and
    Â¶ Your names shal be put to oblyuyone.                  cou{n}terfete

    Â¶ Thus went Attropos fro the paleys wrooth.
    Â¶ But in the mene tyme whyle {that} he there was.
    Â¶ Glydyng by the paleys resydyuacyon gooth.
    Â¶ Towarde Macrocosme with a peynted fase.
    Â¶ Clad lyke a pylgryme walkyng a grete pase.
    Â¶ In the forme as he had ben a man of ynde.
    Â¶ He wede haue made reson & sadnesse both bly{n}de

    Â¶ With sensualyte was he soone aqueynted.
    Â¶ To whome he declared his mater pryuely.
    Â¶ Yet he was espyed for all his face peynted.
    Â¶ Then reson hy{m} co{m}mauded pyke hy{m} the{n}s lightly.
    Â¶ For his ease q{uo}d sadnesse so cou{n}seyll hym wyll I.
    Â¶ Soo was sensualyte ay kepte vnder foote.
    Â¶ That to resydyuacyon myght he doo no boote.

    Â¶ Then went he to Nature & asked her auyse.
    Â¶ His entent to opteynde what was best to doo.
    Â¶ She sayd euer syth Vertu of vyce wan {the} pryse.
    Â¶ Reson with sadnesse hath rewled the felde soo.
    Â¶ That I & sensualyte may lytyll for the doo.
    Â¶ For I may noo more but oonly kepe my cours.
    Â¶ And yet is sensualyte strenger kept & wours.

    Â¶ Th{us} hery{n}g resydiuacon fro the{n}s he went ageyn
    Â¶ Full of thought & sorow {that} he myght not spede.
    Â¶ Than reson & sadnesse toke wedehokes tweyn.
    Â¶ And all wylde wa{n}tonesse out {the} felde gan wede.
    Â¶ With all the slyper grasse {that} grewe of the sede.  Original has
    Â¶ That sensualyte before therin sew.                    thr instead
    Â¶ And fro thens forth kept it clene for vertew          of the

    Â¶ Than began new grase in the felde to spryng.
    Â¶ All vnlyke {that} other of colour fayr & bryght.
    Â¶ But then I aspyed a meruelous thyng.
    Â¶ For the grou{n}de of {the} felde gan wex hore & whyt.
    Â¶ I coude not conceyue how {that} be myght.
    Â¶ Tyll I was enformed & taught it to know.
    Â¶ But wher vertu occupyet must nedes wel grow

    Yet in the mene tyme while the felde thus grow.
    Â¶ And reson with sadnesse therof had gouerau{n}ce.
    Â¶ Many a preuy messenger thyder sent Vertew.
    Â¶ To know yf it were guyded to his plesau{n}ce.
    Â¶ Now prayer eft fastyng & often tyme penau{n}ce.
    Â¶ And whan he myght goo preuely almesdede.
    Â¶ And bad hy{m} to his power helpe where he se nede

    While {that} felde thus rewled reson with sadnesse.
    Â¶ Maugre dame Nature for all her carnall might
    Â¶ Came thyder Attropos voyd of all gladnesse.
    Â¶ Wrapped in his shete & axed of ony wyght.
    Â¶ Coude wysse hym the vay to the lorde of light.

    Â¶ But now the .iiii. must thou haue in mynde

    Â¶ Whiche is callid p{ro}perly {the} tyme of pylgremage
    Â¶ After some & some named it otherwyse
    Â¶ And call hit the tyme of daungerous passage
    Â¶ And some of werre that fully hit dyspyse
    Â¶ But what so it be named I wyll the auyse
    Â¶ Remembre it well and prynte it in thy mynde
    Â¶ Wherof the fygure mayst thou me behynde

    Â¶ And elles remembre thyselfe in thyne herte
    Â¶ How Vyce & Vertue dayly theym occupy
    Â¶ In maner one of hem hym to peruerte
    Â¶ Another to bryng hym to endeles glory
    Â¶ Thus they contynue fyght for the vyctory
    Â¶ Hit is no nede herof to tell the more
    Â¶ For in this short vysyon {thou} hast seen it before

    Â¶ And as for Attropos greuous compleynt
    Â¶ Vnto the goddys betokeneth noo more
    Â¶ But oonly to shew the how frendely constrey{n}t
    Â¶ On a stedfast herte weyeth full sore
    Â¶ Good wyll requyreth good wyll ayene therfore
    Â¶ Dyscorde to deth hathe ay byn a frende
    Â¶ For Dyscorde bryngeth many to her ende

    Â¶ Wherfore Dethe thought he wolde auenged be
    Â¶ On his frendes quarell yf that he myghte
    Â¶ For her gret vnkyndnesse is somoche as she
    Â¶ Was among hem all had so in despyte
    Â¶ And at that ba[n]ket made of soo lyte
    Â¶ Which caused hym among he{m} to cast in a bone
    Â¶ That fou{n}de they{m} gnawyng ynough euerichone

    Â¶ Thus ofte is seen on frende for a nother
    Â¶ Wyll say & doo and some tyme maters feyne
    Â¶ And also kynnysmen a cosyne or a brother
    Â¶ Wyll for his alyer he haue cause compleyne
    Â¶ And where that he loueth doo his besy peyne
    Â¶ His frendes mater as his owne to take
    Â¶ Whiche oft sythe causeth mychyll sorow awake

    Â¶ Be hit ryght or wrong he chargeth not a myte
    Ap towarde that poynt he taketh lytyll hede
    Â¶ So that he may haue his frowarde appetyte
    Performed he careth not how his soule spede (not{e}
    Â¶ Of God or Deuyll haue suche lytyll drede
    Â¶ How be it one there is that lord is of all
    Â¶ Whiche to euery wyght at last rewarde shall

    Â¶ And as for {the} batayl betwene Vertu holde
    Â¶ Soo playnly appereth to the inwardly
    Â¶ To make exposycyon therof new or olde
    Â¶ Were but superfluyte therefore refuse hit I
    Â¶ In man shall thou fynde {that} were kept dayly
    Â¶ Lyke as {thou} hast seen it fowty[u]e before thy face
    Â¶ The pycture me behynd{e} sheweth it i{n} lytyll space

    Â¶ And as for Macrocosme it is nomore to say
    Â¶ But the lesse worlde to the comon entent
    Â¶ Whiche applyed is to man both nyght & day
    Â¶ Soo is man the felde to which all were sent
    Â¶ On bothe partyes & they that thyder went
    Â¶ Sygnyfye nomore but after the condycyon
    Â¶ Of euery manes opynyon

    Â¶ And as for the noble knygt Perseueraunce
    Â¶ Which gate the felde when it was almost gone
    Â¶ Betokeneth nomore but the contynuaunce
    Â¶ Of vertuous lyvyng tyll dethe hath auergone
    Â¶ Who soo wyll doo rewarded is anone
    Â¶ As Vertue was with the crowne on hy
    whiche is noo more but euerlastyng glory

    Â¶ And as for Prestynacyon                       The line is cut short.
    Â¶ That eche of hem rewarded after his deserte   The line must be:
    Â¶ Is to vnderstonde nomore but dampnacyon       And as for Prescience
    Â¶ To vycyous people is the verey scourge smert  and Predestinacion
    Â¶ Rewarde for they fro Vertue wolde peruert
    Â¶ And endelesse Ioye is to hem that be electe
    Â¶ Rewarded & to all that folow the same secte

    Â¶ And as for the keyes of the posternes fyue
    Whiche were to Morple{us} rewarded for his laboure
    Â¶ Sygnyfye not elles but whyle man is on lyue
    Â¶ His fyue inwarde wyttes shall be euery hour
    Â¶ In his slepe occupyed in hele & in langour
    Â¶ With fantasyes tryfels Illusyons & dremes
    Â¶ Whiche Poetes call Morpleus stremes

    Â¶ And as for Residiuacyon is nomore to say
    Â¶ But after Confessyon tornyng ayene to synne
    Â¶ Whiche to euery man retornyth sauns delay
    Â¶ To vycyous lyuyng agayn hym to wynne
    Â¶ Whyle ony man lyueth wyll it neuer blynne
    Â¶ That cursed conclusyon for to bryng aboute
    Â¶ But Reason with Sadnes kepe it styll oute

    Â¶ Here hast thou properly the verrey sentence
    Â¶ Perde now declared of this vysyon
    Â¶ The pycture also yeueth clere intellygence
    Â¶ Therof beholden with good dyscresyon
    Â¶ Loke well aboute and take consyderasyon
    Â¶ As I haue declared whether hit soo be
    Â¶ A syr quoth Morpleus what tolde I the

    Â¶ Hast thou properly the verey sentence
    Â¶ Loke on yon wall yonder before
    Â¶ And all that tyme stood I in a wyre
    Â¶ Whiche way first myn hert wolde yeue more
    Â¶ To loke in a stody stood I therfore
    Â¶ Neuerthelesse at last as Morpleus me badde
    Â¶ I loked forwarde with contenaunce sadde

    Â¶ Where I beheld in portrayture
    Â¶ The maner of the felde euen as it was
    Shewed me before & euery creature
    Â¶ On bothe sydes beyng drawyng in small space
    Â¶ Soo caryously in soo lytyll a compace
    Â¶ In all this worlde was neuer thyng wrought
    Â¶ Hit were Impossyble in erthe to be thought

    Â¶ And when I had long beholde that pycture
    Â¶ What q{uo}d Morpleus how longe shalte thou loke
    Â¶ Daryng as a dastard on yon portrayture:
    Â¶ Come of for shame thy wytte stante a croke
    Â¶ I heryng that myn herte to me toke
    Â¶ Towarde the fourthe wall tornyng my vysage
    Â¶ Where I sawe Poetes & Phylosophers sage

    Â¶ Many one moo that at the banket
    Â¶ Serued the goddes as I sayde before
    Â¶ Som were made standyng & som in chayris set
    Â¶ Som lokyng on bokys as they had stodyed sore
    Â¶ Som drawyng almenakis & in her hondis bore
    Â¶ Astyrlabes takyng the altytude of the sonne
    Â¶ Among whome Dyogenes sate in a tonne

    Â¶ And as I was lokyng on that fourthe wall
    Â¶ Of Dyogenes beholdyng the ymage
    Â¶ Sodeynly Doctryne began me to call
    Â¶ And bad me tourne towarde hyr my vysage
    Â¶ And soo then I dyde with humble corage
    Â¶ Whan thynkest {thou} she sayd hast {thou} not thentent
    Â¶ Yet of these foure walles what they represent

    Â¶ The pycture on the fyrst {that} standeth at my bake
    Â¶ Sheweth the {the} present tyme of pylgremage
    Â¶ Of whiche before I vnto the spake
    Â¶ Whiche is the tyme of daungerous passage
    Â¶ The seconde dyscrettly agayne my vysage
    Â¶ The tyme expresseth of Deuyacyon
    Â¶ Whyle paynyme lawe had the domynacyon

    Â¶ The thryd wall standyng on my lyfe honde
    Â¶ The tyme representeth of Reuocacyon
    Â¶ And the fourthe standyng on my ryght honde
    Â¶ Determyneth the tyme of Reconsylyacyon
    Â¶ This is the effecte of thy vysyon
    Â¶ Wherfore the nedeth no more theron to muse
    Â¶ Hit were but veyne thy wyttes to dysuse

    Â¶ But duryng the tym of Reconsylyacyon
    Â¶ Thy tyme of pylgremage loke well {thou} spende
    Â¶ And then woll gracyous Predestynacyon                 Original has
    Â¶ Bryng the to glory at thy law ende                    well instead
    Â¶ And euen with that came to my mynde                   of woll
    Â¶ My fyrst conclusyon that I was aboute
    Â¶ To haue dreuen er slepe made me to lute

    Â¶ That is to say how Sensualyte
    Â¶ {With} Reason to acorde myght be brought aboute
    Â¶ Whiche caused me to knele downe on my kne
    Â¶ And beseke Doctryne determyne that doute
    Â¶ Oo Lord god sayd Doctry{n}e canst {thou} not withoute
    Â¶ Me that conclusyon bryng to an ende
    Â¶ Ferre is fro the wytte & ferther good mende

    Â¶ And euen with that Dethe gan appere
    Â¶ Shewyng hymselfe as though that he wolde
    Â¶ His darte haue occupyed within that herbere
    Â¶ But there was none for hym yong nor olde
    Â¶ Saue oonly I Doctrine hym tolde
    Â¶ And when I herde hyr with hym comon thus
    Â¶ I me withdrew behynde Morpleus.

    Â¶ Dredyng full sore lest he with his dart.
    Â¶ Through Doctrynes wordes ony entresse.
    Â¶ In me wolde haue had or claymed ony part
    Â¶ Which sholde haue caused me grete heuynesse
    Â¶ Within whiche tyme & short processe
    Â¶ Came thyder Reason and Sensualyte.
    Â¶ A quoth Doctryne ryght welcome be ye

    Â¶ Hit is not long sythe we of you spake
    Â¶ Ye must er ye goo determyne a doute
    Â¶ And euen with that she the mater brake
    Â¶ To theym & tolde hit euery where aboute
    Â¶ I wolde haue be thens yf I had moute
    Â¶ For fere I loked as blake as a cole
    Â¶ I wolde haue cropen in a mouse hole

    Â¶ What quoth Doctryne where is he now
    Â¶ That meu[i]d this mater straunge & dyffuse
    Â¶ He is a cowarde I make myn auow
    Â¶ He hyded his hede his mocyon to refuse
    Â¶ Blame hym not q{uo}d Reason alway {that} to vse
    Â¶ When he seeth Dethe soo nere at his honde
    Â¶ Yet is his part hym to withstonde

    Â¶ Or at the leste way elles fro hym flee                Original has
    Â¶ As longe as he may who dooth other wyse               fym instead
    Â¶ Is an ydeote quoth Sensualytee                        of hym
    Â¶ Who dredeth not Dethe wyse men hym dyspyse
    Â¶ What said Doctryne how long hathe this gyse
    Â¶ Be holden & vsed thus atwixe you tweyne
    Â¶ Ye were not wonte to acorde certeyne

    Â¶ Yes quoth Reason in this poynt alway
    Â¶ To euery man haue we yeuen our counsayll
    Â¶ Dethe for to flee as long as they may
    Â¶ Although wo otherwyse haue done our trauayl
    Â¶ Eche other to represse yet withoute fayll
    Â¶ In that poynt oonly dyscordeth we neuer
    Â¶ Thus condescended therin be we for euer

    Â¶ Aha sayd Doctryne then is the conclusyon
    Â¶ Clerely determined of the gret doute
    Â¶ That here wes meuyd & halfe in derysyon
    Â¶ She me then called & bade me loke oute
    Â¶ Come forthe she sayd & feere not this route
    Â¶ And euen with that Reason & Sensualyte
    Â¶ And Dethe fro thens were vanysshed all thre

    Â¶ Then loked I forthe as Doctryne me badde
    Â¶ When Dethe was gone me thought I was bolde
    Â¶ To shewe myselfe but yet was I sadde
    Â¶ Me thought my doute was not as I wolde
    Â¶ Clerely and openly declared & tolde
    Â¶ Hit sowned to me as a parable
    Â¶ Derke as a myste or a fayned fable                    Original has
                                                            myhe instead
    Â¶ And Doctryne my conceyte gan espy                     of myste
    Â¶ Wherfore sayd she standest thou soo styll
    Â¶ Wherin is thy thought arte thou in stody
    Â¶ Of thy questyon hast thou not thy fyll
    Â¶ To the declared tell me thy wyll.
    Â¶ Herdest thou not Reason & Sensualyte
    Â¶ Declared thy doute here before the

    Â¶ Forsothe quoth I I herde what they sayde
    Â¶ But neuerthelesse my wytte is so thynne
    Â¶ And also of Dethe I was so afrayde
    Â¶ That hit is out where hit vent ynne
    Â¶ And so that mater can I not wynne
    Â¶ Without your helpe & benyuolence
    Â¶ Therof to expresse the veray sentence

    Â¶ Well quod Doctryne then yeue attendaunce
    Â¶ Vnto my wordes & thou shalt here
    Â¶ Openly declared the concordaunce
    Â¶ Atwene Sensualyte & Reason in fere
    Â¶ If thou take hede hit clerely dooth apere
    Â¶ How they were knette in one opynyon
    Â¶ Bothe agayn Dethe helde contradyccon

    Â¶ Whiche concordaunce no more sygnyfyeth
    Â¶ To playne vnderstandyng but in euery mane
    Â¶ Bothe Sensualyte & Reason applyeth
    Â¶ Rather Dethe to flee then with hir to be tane
    Â¶ Loo in that poynt accorde they holly thane
    Â¶ And in all other they clerely dyscorde
    Â¶ Thus is trewly set thy doubtfull monacorde

    Â¶ I heryng that kneled on my kne
    Â¶ And thanked her lowly for her dyscyplyne
    Â¶ That she wouchesafe of her benygnyte
    Â¶ Of tho gret doubtes me to enlumyne
    Â¶ Well was she worthy to be called Doctryne
    Â¶ If it had be no more but for the solucyon
    Â¶ Of my demaunde & of this straunge vysyon

    Â¶ And as I with myne hede began for to bow
    Â¶ As me well ought to do her reuerence
    Â¶ She thens departed I can not tell how
    Â¶ But within a moment gone was she thens
    Â¶ Then sayd Morpleus let vs go hens
    Â¶ what sholde we here tarye lengere
    Â¶ Hast thou not herde a generall answere

    Â¶ To all thy materes that thou lyst to meue
    Â¶ My tyme draweth nere that I must rest
    Â¶ And euen therewith he toke me by the sleue
    Â¶ And sayd goo we hens for that sholde I best
    Â¶ As good is ynough as a grete fest
    Â¶ Thou hast seen ynough holde the content
    Â¶ And euen with {that} forthe with hym I went

    Â¶ Tyll he had me brought agene to my bedde
    Â¶ where he me founde and then pryuely                   Original has
    Â¶ He stale awaye I coude not vnderstande                pruyely
    Â¶ were he became but sodeynly                           instead of
    Â¶ As he came he went I tell you veryly                  pryuely
    Â¶ whiche done fro slepe I gan to awake
    Â¶ My body all in swet began for to shake

    Â¶ For drede of the syght that I had sene
    Â¶ wenyng to me all had be trew
    Â¶ Actuelly done where I had bene
    Â¶ That batyll holde twene Vyce & Vertew
    Â¶ But when I see hit hit was but a whew
    Â¶ A dreme a fantasy & a thyng of nought
    Â¶ To study thereon I had nomore thought

    Â¶ Tyll at the last I gan me bethynke
    Â¶ For what cause shewed was this vysyon
    Â¶ I knew not wherefore I toke pen & ynke
    Â¶ And paper therof to make mencyon
    Â¶ In wrytyng takyng consyderacyon
    Â¶ That noo defaute were found in me
    Â¶ whereon accused I ought for to be

    Â¶ For slouthe that I had left hit vntolde

    Â¶ Put it in wrytyng where thorugh manyfolde
    Â¶ wayes of accusacio{n} myght torne me to greuau{n}ce
    Â¶ All this I sawe as I lay in a traunce
    Â¶ But wheder it was with myne ey bodely
    Â¶ Or not in certayn god knoweth & not I

    Â¶ That to dyscerne I purpose not to dele
    Â¶ Soo large by my wyll it longeth not to me
    Â¶ were hit dreme or vysyon for your owne wele
    Â¶ All that shall hit rede here rad or se
    Â¶ Take thereof the best & let the worst be
    Â¶ Try out the corne clene from the chaff
    And then may ye say ye have a sure staff

    Â¶ To stande by at nede of ye wyll it holde
    Â¶ And walke by the way of Vertue
    Â¶ But alwey beware be ye yong or olde
    Â¶ That your Frewyll ay to Vertue more

    Â¶ The burden of the felde that ye dayly fyght
