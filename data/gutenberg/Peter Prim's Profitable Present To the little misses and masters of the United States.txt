Price plain, 12-1/2 cents--coloured 18-3/4 cents.
Come buckle my Shoe.
You lazy Elf!
Pray do it yourself.
_Philadel^a. Pub. and Sold by W. Charles._
Shut the door:
Let us keep ourselves warm
And not think of the storm.
I'm picking some sticks,
That my mother may make
A nice currant Cake.
You are come here too late.
'Tis all one to Ben,
He can go home again.
Who'll buy a fat Hen?
Her bones are so small
You may eat legs and all.
I can dig and can delve,
Take care of the Sows,
And bring home the cows.
