MORNING.


   â€™TIS the hour when white-horsed Day
   Chases Night her mares away;
   When the Gates of Dawn (they say)
      PhÅ“bus opes:
   And I gather that the Queen
   May be uniformly seen,
   Should the weather be serene,
      On the slopes.

   When the ploughman, as he goes
   Leathern-gaitered oâ€™er the snows,
   From his hat and from his nose
      Knocks the ice;
   And the panes are frosted oâ€™er,
   And the lawn is crisp and hoar,
   As has been observed before
      Once or twice.

   When arrayed in breastplate red
   Sings the robin, for his bread,
   On the elmtree that hath shed
      Every leaf;
   While, within, the frost benumbs
   The still sleepy schoolboyâ€™s thumbs,
   And in consequence his sums
      Come to grief.

   But when breakfast-time hath come,
   And heâ€™s crunching crust and crumb,
   Heâ€™ll no longer look a glum
      Little dunce;
   But be brisk as bees that settle
   On a summer roseâ€™s petal:
   Wherefore, Polly, put the kettle
      On at once.




EVENING.


   KATE! if eâ€™er thy light foot lingers
      On the lawn, when up the fells
   Steals the Dark, and fairy fingers
      Close unseen the pimpernels:
   When, his thighs with sweetness laden,
      From the meadow comes the bee,
   And the lover and the maiden
      Stand beneath the trysting tree:â€”

   Lingers on, till stars unnumberâ€™d
      Tremble in the breeze-swept tarn,
   And the bat that all day slumberâ€™d
      Flits about the lonely barn;
   And the shapes that shrink from garish
      Noon are peopling cairn and lea;
   And thy sire is almost bearish
      If kept waiting for his tea:â€”

   And the screech-owl scares the peasant
      As he skirts some churchyard drear;
   And the goblins whisper pleasant
      Tales in Miss Rossettiâ€™s ear;
   Importuning her in strangest,
      Sweetest tones to buy their fruits:â€”
   O be careful that thou changest,
      On returning home, thy boots.




SHELTER.


   BY the wide lakeâ€™s margin I markâ€™d her lieâ€”
      The wide, weird lake where the alders sighâ€”
   A young fair thing, with a shy, soft eye;
      And I deemâ€™d that her thoughts had flown
   To her home, and her brethren, and sisters dear,
   As she lay there watching the dark, deep mere,
      All motionless, all alone.

   Then I heard a noise, as of men and boys,
      And a boisterous troop drew nigh.
   Whither now will retreat those fairy feet?
      Where hide till the storm pass by?
   One glanceâ€”the wild glance of a hunted thingâ€”
   She cast behind her; she gave one spring;
   And there followâ€™d a splash and a broadening ring
      On the lake where the alders sigh.

   She had gone from the ken of ungentle men!
      Yet scarce did I mourn for that;
   For I knew she was safe in her own home then,
   And, the danger past, would appear again,
      For she was a water-rat.




IN THE GLOAMING.


   IN the Gloaming to be roaming, where the crested waves are foaming,
      And the shy mermaidens combing locks that ripple to their feet;
   When the Gloaming is, I never made the ghost of an endeavour
      To discoverâ€”but whatever were the hour, it would be sweet.

   â€œTo their feet,â€ I say, for Leechâ€™s sketch indisputably teaches
      That the mermaids of our beaches do not end in ugly tails,
   Nor have homes among the corals; but are shod with neat balmorals,
      An arrangement no one quarrels with, as many might with scales.

   Sweet to roam beneath a shady cliff, of course with some young lady,
      Lalage, NeÃ¦ra, Haidee, or Elaine, or Mary Ann:
   Love, you dear delusive dream, you!  Very sweet your victims deem you,
      When, heard only by the seamew, they talk all the stuff one can.

   Sweet to haste, a licensed lover, to Miss Pinkerton the glover,
      Having managed to discover what is dear NeÃ¦raâ€™s â€œsizeâ€:
   Pâ€™raps to touch that wrist so slender, as your tiny gift you tender,
      And to read youâ€™re no offender, in those laughing hazel eyes.

   Then to hear her call you â€œHarry,â€ when she makes you fetch and carryâ€”
      O young men about to marry, what a blessed thing it is!
   To be photographâ€™dâ€”togetherâ€”cased in pretty Russia leatherâ€”
      Hear her gravely doubting whether they have spoilt your honest
   phiz!

   Then to bring your plighted fair one first a ringâ€”a rich and rare oneâ€”
      Next a bracelet, if sheâ€™ll wear one, and a heap of things beside;
   And serenely bending oâ€™er her, to inquire if it would bore her
      To say when her own adorer may aspire to call her bride!

   Then, the days of courtship over, with your WIFE to start for Dover
      Or Dieppeâ€”and live in clover evermore, whateâ€™er befalls:
   For Iâ€™ve read in many a novel that, unless theyâ€™ve souls that grovel,
      Folks _prefer_ in fact a hovel to your dreary marble halls:

   To sit, happy married lovers; Phillis trifling with a ploverâ€™s
      Egg, while Corydon uncovers with a grace the Sally Lunn,
   Or dissects the lucky pheasantâ€”that, I think, were passing pleasant;
      As I sit alone at present, dreaming darkly of a Dun.




THE PALACE.


   THEY come, they come, with fife and drum,
      And gleaming pikes and glancing banners:
   Though the eyes flash, the lips are dumb;
      To talk in rank would not be manners.
   Onward they stride, as Britons can;
   The ladies following in the Van.

   Who, who be these that tramp in threes
      Through sumptuous Piccadilly, through
   The roaring Strand, and stand at ease
      At last â€™neath shadowy Waterloo?
   Some gallant Guild, I ween, are they;
   Taking their annual holiday.

   To catch the destinâ€™d trainâ€”to pay
      Their willing fares, and plunge within itâ€”
   Is, as in old Romaunt they say,
      With them the work of half-a-minute.
   Then off theyâ€™re whirlâ€™d, with songs and shouting,
   To cedared Sydenham for their outing.

   I markâ€™d them light, with faces bright
      As pansies or a new coinâ€™d florin,
   And up the sunless stair take flight,
      Close-packâ€™d as rabbits in a warren.
   Honour the Brave, who in that stress
   Still trod not upon Beautyâ€™s dress!

   Kerchief in hand I saw them stand;
      In every kerchief lurkâ€™d a lunch;
   When they unfurlâ€™d them, it was grand
      To watch bronzed men and maidens crunch
   The sounding celery-stick, or ram
   The knife into the blushing ham.

   Dashâ€™d the bold fork through pies of pork;
      Oâ€™er hard-boilâ€™d eggs the saltspoon shook;
   Leapt from its lair the playful cork:
      Yet some there were, to whom the brook
   Seemâ€™d sweetest beverage, and for meat
   They chose the red root of the beet.

   Then many a song, some rather long,
      Came quivering up from girlish throats;
   And one young man he came out strong,
      And gave â€œThe Wolfâ€ without his notes.
   While they who knew not song or ballad
   Still munchâ€™d, approvingly, their salad.

   But ah! what bard could sing how hard,
      The artless banquet oâ€™er, they ran
   Down the soft slope with daisies starrâ€™d
      And kingcups! onward, maid with man,
   They flew, to scale the breezy swing,
   Or court frank kisses in the ring.

   Such are the sylvan scenes that thrill
      This heart!  The lawns, the happy shade,
   Where matrons, whom the sunbeams grill,
      Stir with slow spoon their lemonade;
   And maidens flirt (no extra charge)
   In comfort at the fountainâ€™s marge!

   Others may praise the â€œgrand displaysâ€
      Where â€œfiery arch,â€ â€œcascade,â€ and â€œcomet,â€
   Set the whole garden in a â€œblazeâ€!
      Far, at such times, may I be from it;
   Though then the public may be â€œlost
   In wonderâ€ at a trifling cost.

   Fannâ€™d by the breeze, to puff at ease
      My faithful pipe is all I crave:
   And if folks rave about the â€œtrees
      Lit up by fireworks,â€ let them rave.
   Your monster fÃªtes, I like not these;
   Though they bring grist to the lessees.




PEACE.
A STUDY.


   HE stood, a worn-out City clerkâ€”
      Whoâ€™d toilâ€™d, and seen no holiday,
   For forty years from dawn to darkâ€”
      Alone beside Caermarthen Bay.

   He felt the salt spray on his lips;
      Heard childrenâ€™s voices on the sands;
   Up the sunâ€™s path he saw the ships
      Sail on and on to other lands;

   And laughâ€™d aloud.  Each sight and sound
      To him was joy too deep for tears;
   He sat him on the beach, and bound
      A blue bandana round his ears:

   And thought how, posted near his door,
      His own green door on Camden Hill,
   Two bands at least, most likely more,
      Were mingling at their own sweet will

   Verdi with Vance.  And at the thought
      He laughâ€™d again, and softly drew
   That Morning Herald that heâ€™d bought
      Forth from his breast, and read it through.




THE ARAB.


      ON, on, my brown Arab, away, away!
   Thou hast trotted oâ€™er many a mile to-day,
   And I trow right meagre hath been thy fare
   Since they roused thee at dawn from thy straw-piled lair,
   To tread with those echoless unshod feet
   Yon weltering flats in the noontide heat,
   Where no palmtree proffers a kindly shade
   And the eye never rests on a cool grass blade;
   And lank is thy flank, and thy frequent cough
   Oh! it goes to my heartâ€”but away, friend, off!

      And yet, ah! what sculptor who saw thee stand,
   As thou standest now, on thy Native Strand,
   With the wild wind ruffling thine uncombâ€™d hair,
   And thy nostril upturnâ€™d to the odâ€™rous air,
   Would not woo thee to pause till his skill might trace
   At leisure the lines of that eager face;
   The collarless neck and the coal-black paws
   And the bit graspâ€™d tight in the massive jaws;
   The delicate curve of the legs, that seem
   Too slight for their burdenâ€”and, O, the gleam
   Of that eye, so sombre and yet so gay!
   Still away, my lithe Arab, once more away!

      Nay, tempt me not, Arab, again to stay;
   Since I crave neither Echo nor Fun to-day.
   For thy _hand_ is not Echolessâ€”there they are
   Fun, Glowworm, and Echo, and Evening Star:
   And thou hintest withal that thou fain wouldâ€™st shine,
   As I con them, these bulgy old boots of mine.
   But I shrink from thee, Arab!  Thou eatâ€™st eel-pie,
   Thou evermore hast at least one black eye;
   There is brass on thy brow, and thy swarthy hues
   Are due not to nature but handling shoes;
   And the hit in thy mouth, I regret to see,
   Is a bit of tobacco-pipeâ€”Flee, child, flee!




LINES ON HEARING THE ORGAN.


   GRINDER, who serenely grindest
      At my door the Hundredth Psalm,
   Till thou ultimately findest
      Pence in thy unwashen palm:

   Grinder, jocund-hearted Grinder,
      Near whom Barbaryâ€™s nimble son,
   Poised with skill upon his hinder
      Paws, accepts the proffered bun:

   Dearly do I love thy grinding;
      Joy to meet thee on thy road
   Where thou prowlest through the blinding
      Dust with that stupendous load,

   â€™Neath the baleful star of Sirius,
      When the postmen slowlier jog,
   And the ox becomes delirious,
      And the muzzle decks the dog.

   Tell me by what art thou bindest
      On thy feet those ancient shoon:
   Tell me, Grinder, if thou grindest
      Always, always out of tune.

   Tell me if, as thou art buckling
      On thy straps with eager claws,
   Thou forecastest, inly chuckling,
      All the rage that thou wilt cause.

   Tell me if at all thou mindest
      When folks flee, as if on wings,
   From thee as at ease thou grindest:
      Tell me fifty thousand things.

   Grinder, gentle-hearted Grinder!
      Ruffians who led evil lives,
   Soothed by thy sweet strains, are kinder
      To their bullocks and their wives:

   Children, when they see thy supple
      Form approach, are out like shots;
   Half-a-bar sets several couple
      Waltzing in convenient spots;

   Not with clumsy Jacks or Georges:
      Unprofaned by grasp of man
   Maidens speed those simple orgies,
      Betsey Jane with Betsey Ann.

   As they love thee in St. Gilesâ€™s
      Thou art loved in Grosvenor Square:
   None of those engaging smiles is
      Unreciprocated there.

   Often, ere yet thou hast hammerâ€™d
      Through thy four delicious airs,
   Coins are flung thee by enamourâ€™d
      Housemaids upon area stairs:

   Eâ€™en the ambrosial-whiskerâ€™d flunkey
      Eyes thy boots and thine unkempt
   Beard and melancholy monkey
      More in pity than contempt.

   Far from England, in the sunny
      South, where Anio leaps in foam,
   Thou wast rearâ€™d, till lack of money
      Drew thee from thy vineclad home:

   And thy mate, the sinewy Jocko,
      From Brazil or Afric came,
   Land of simoom and siroccoâ€”
      And he seems extremely tame.

   There he quaffâ€™d the undefilÃ¨d
      Spring, or hung with apelike glee,
   By his teeth or tail or eyelid,
      To the slippery mango-tree:

   There he wooâ€™d and won a dusky
      Bride, of instincts like his own;
   Talkâ€™d of love till he was husky
      In a tongue to us unknown:

   Side by side â€™twas theirs to ravage
      The potato ground, or cut
   Down the unsuspecting savage
      With the well-aimâ€™d cocoa-nut:â€”

   Till the miscreant Stranger tore him
      Screaming from his blue-faced fair;
   And they flung strange raiment oâ€™er him,
      Raiment which he could not bear:

   Severâ€™d from the pure embraces
      Of his children and his spouse,
   He must ride fantastic races
      Mounted on reluctant sows:

   But the heart of wistful Jocko
      Still was with his ancient flame
   In the nutgroves of Morocco;
      Or if not itâ€™s all the same.

   Grinder, winsome grinsome Grinder!
      They who see thee and whose soul
   Melts not at thy charms, are blinder
      Than a trebly-bandaged mole:

   They to whom thy curt (yet clever)
      Talk, thy music and thine ape,
   Seem not to be joys for ever,
      Are but brutes in human shape.

   â€™Tis not that thy mien is stately,
      â€™Tis not that thy tones are soft;
   â€™Tis not that I care so greatly
      For the same thing playâ€™d so oft:

   But Iâ€™ve heard mankind abuse thee;
      And perhaps itâ€™s rather strange,
   But I thought that I would choose thee
      For encomium, as a change.




CHANGED.


   I KNOW not why my soul is rackâ€™d
      Why I neâ€™er smile as was my wont:
   I only know that, as a fact,
         I donâ€™t.
   I used to roam oâ€™er glen and glade
      Buoyant and blithe as other folk:
   And not unfrequently I made
         A joke.

   A minstrelâ€™s fire within me burnâ€™d,
      Iâ€™d sing, as one whose heart must break,
   Lay upon lay: I nearly learnâ€™d
         To shake.
   All day I sang; of love, of fame,
      Of fights our fathers fought of yore,
   Until the thing almost became
         A bore.

   I cannot sing the old songs now!
      It is not that I deem them low;
   â€™Tis that I canâ€™t remember how
         They go.
   I could not range the hills till high
      Above me stood the summer moon:
   And as to dancing, I could fly
         As soon.

   The sports, to which with boyish glee
      I sprang erewhile, attract no more;
   Although I am but sixty-three
         Or four.
   Nay, worse than that, Iâ€™ve seemâ€™d of late
      To shrink from happy boyhoodâ€”boys
   Have grown so noisy, and I hate
         A noise.

   They fright me, when the beech is green,
      By swarming up its stem for eggs:
   They drive their horrid hoops between
         My legs:â€”
   Itâ€™s idle to repine, I know;
      Iâ€™ll tell you what Iâ€™ll do instead:
   Iâ€™ll drink my arrowroot, and go
         To bed.




FIRST LOVE.


   O MY earliest love, who, ere I numberâ€™d
      Ten sweet summers, made my bosom thrill!
   Will a swallowâ€”or a swift, or some birdâ€”
      Fly to her and say, I love her still?

   Say my lifeâ€™s a desert drear and arid,
      To its one green spot I aye recur:
   Never, neverâ€”although three times marriedâ€”
      Have I cared a jot for aught but her.

   No, mine own! though early forced to leave you,
      Still my heart was there where first we met;
   In those â€œLodgings with an ample sea-view,â€
      Which were, forty years ago, â€œTo Let.â€

   There I saw her first, our landlordâ€™s oldest
      Little daughter.  On a thing so fair
   Thou, O Sun,â€”who (so they say) beholdest
      Everything,â€”hast gazed, I tell thee, neâ€™er.

   There she satâ€”so near me, yet remoter
      Than a starâ€”a blue-eyed bashful imp:
   On her lap she held a happy bloater,
      â€™Twixt her lips a yet more happy shrimp.

   And I loved her, and our troth we plighted
      On the morrow by the shingly shore:
   In a fortnight to be disunited
      By a bitter fate for evermore.

   O my own, my beautiful, my blue eyed!
      To be young once more, and bite my thumb
   At the world and all its cares with you, Iâ€™d
      Give no inconsiderable sum.

   Hand in hand we trampâ€™d the golden seaweed,
      Soon as oâ€™er the gray cliff peepâ€™d the dawn:
   Side by side, when came the hour for tea, weâ€™d
      Crunch the mottled shrimp and hairy prawn:â€”

   Has she wedded some gigantic shrimper,
      That sweet mite with whom I loved to play?
   Is she girt with babes that whine and whimper,
      That bright being who was always gay?

   Yesâ€”she has at least a dozen wee things!
      Yesâ€”I see her darning corduroys,
   Scouring floors, and setting out the tea-things,
      For a howling herd of hungry boys,

   In a home that reeks of tar and sperm-oil!
      But at intervals she thinks, I know,
   Of those days which we, afar from turmoil,
      Spent together forty years ago.

   O my earliest love, still unforgotten,
      With your downcast eyes of dreamy blue!
   Never, somehow, could I seem to cotton
      To another as I did to you!




WANDERERS.


   AS oâ€™er the hill we roamâ€™d at will,
      My dog and I together,
   We markâ€™d a chaise, by two bright bays
      Slow-moved along the heather:

   Two bays arch neckâ€™d, with tails erect
      And gold upon their blinkers;
   And by their side an ass I spied;
      It was a travelling tinkerâ€™s.

   The chaise went by, nor aught cared I;
      Such things are not in my way:
   I turnâ€™d me to the tinker, who
      Was loafing down a by-way:

   I askâ€™d him where he livedâ€”a stare
      Was all I got in answer,
   As on he trudged: I rightly judged
      The stare said, â€œWhere I can, sir.â€

   I askâ€™d him if heâ€™d take a whiff
      Of â€™bacco; he acceded;
   He grew communicative too,
      (A pipe was all he needed,)
   Till of the tinkerâ€™s life, I think,
      I knew as much as he did.

   â€œI loiter down by thorp and town;
      For any job Iâ€™m willing;
   Take here and there a dusty brown,
      And here and there a shilling.

   â€œI deal in every ware in turn,
      Iâ€™ve rings for buddinâ€™ Sally
   That sparkle like those eyes of herâ€™n;
      Iâ€™ve liquor for the valet.

   â€œI steal from thâ€™ parsonâ€™s strawberry-plots,
      I hide by thâ€™ squireâ€™s covers;
   I teach the sweet young housemaids whatâ€™s
      The art of trapping lovers.

   â€œThe things Iâ€™ve done â€™neath moon and stars
      Have got me into messes:
   Iâ€™ve seen the sky through prison bars.
      Iâ€™ve torn up prison dresses.

   â€œIâ€™ve sat, Iâ€™ve sighâ€™d, Iâ€™ve gloomâ€™d, Iâ€™ve glanced
      With envy at the swallows
   That through the window slid, and danced
      (Quite happy) round the gallows;

   â€œBut out again I come, and show
      My face nor care a stiver
   For trades are brisk and trades are slow,
      But mine goes on for ever.â€

   Thus on he prattled like a babbling brook.
   Then I, â€œThe sun hath slipt behind the hill,
   And my aunt Vivian dines at half-past six.â€
   So in all love we parted; I to the Hall,
   They to the village.  It was noised next noon
   That chickens had been missâ€™d at Syllabub Farm.




SAD MEMORIES.


   THEY tell me I am beautiful: they praise my silken hair,
   My little feet that silently slip on from stair to stair:
   They praise my pretty trustful face and innocent grey eye;
   Fond hands caress me oftentimes, yet would that I might die!

   Why was I born to be abhorrâ€™d of man and bird and beast?
   The bulfinch marks me stealing by, and straight his song hath ceased;
   The shrewmouse eyes me shudderingly, then flees; and, worse than that,
   The housedog he flees after meâ€”why was I born a cat?

   Men prize the heartless hound who quits dry-eyed his native land;
   Who wags a mercenary tail and licks a tyrant hand.
   The leal true cat they prize not, that if eâ€™er compellâ€™d to roam
   Still flies, when let out of the bag, precipitately home.

   They call me cruel.  Do I know if mouse or songbird feels?
   I only know they make me light and salutary meals:
   And if, as â€™tis my nature to, ere I devour I tease â€™em,
   Why should a low-bred gardenerâ€™s boy pursue me with a besom?

   Should china fall or chandeliers, or anything but stocksâ€”
   Nay stocks, when theyâ€™re in flowerpotsâ€”the cat expects hard knocks:
   Should ever anything be missedâ€”milk, coals, umbrellas, brandyâ€”
   The catâ€™s pitchâ€™d into with a boot or any thing thatâ€™s handy.

   â€œI remember, I remember,â€ how one night I â€œfleeted by,â€
   And gainâ€™d the blessed tiles and gazed into the cold clear sky.
   â€œI remember, I remember, how my little lovers came;â€
   And there, beneath the crescent moon, playâ€™d many a little game.

   They foughtâ€”by good St. Catharine, â€™twas a fearsome sight to see
   The coal-black crest, the glowering orbs, of one gigantic He.
   Like bow by some tall bowman bent at Hastings or Poictiers,
   His huge back curved, till none observed a vestige of his ears:

   He stood, an ebon crescent, flouting that ivory moon;
   Then raised the pibroch of his race, the Song without a Tune;
   Gleamâ€™d his white teeth, his mammoth tail waved darkly to and fro,
   As with one complex yell he burst, all claws, upon the foe.

   It thrills me now, that final Miaowâ€”that weird unearthly din:
   Lone maidens heard it far away, and leapâ€™d out of their skin.
   A potboy from his den oâ€™erhead peepâ€™d with a scared wan face;
   Then sent a random brickbat down, which knockâ€™d me into space.

   Nine days I fell, or thereabouts: and, had we not nine lives,
   I wis I neâ€™er had seen again thy sausage-shop, St. Ives!
   Had I, as some cats have, nine tails, how gladly I would lick
   The hand, and person generally, of him who heaved that brick!

   For me they fill the milkbowl up, and cull the choice sardine:
   But ah! I nevermore shall be the cat I once have been!
   The memories of that fatal night they haunt me even now:
   In dreams I see that rampant He, and tremble at that Miaow.




COMPANIONS.
A TALE OF A GRANDFATHER.
BY THE AUTHOR OF â€œDEWY MEMORIES,â€ &c.


      I KNOW not of what we ponderâ€™d
         Or made pretty pretence to talk,
      As, her hand within mine, we wanderâ€™d
         Towâ€™rd the pool by the limetree walk,
   While the dew fell in showers from the passion flowers
      And the blush-rose bent on her stalk.

      I cannot recall her figure:
         Was it regal as Junoâ€™s own?
      Or only a trifle bigger
         Than the elves who surround the throne
   Of the FaÃ«ry Queen, and are seen, I ween,
      By mortals in dreams alone?

      What her eyes were like, I know not:
         Perhaps they were blurrâ€™d with tears;
      And perhaps in your skies there glow not
         (On the contrary) clearer spheres.
   No! as to her eyes I am just as wise
      As you or the cat, my dears.

      Her teeth, I presume, were â€œpearlyâ€:
         But which was she, brunette or blonde?
      Her hair, was it quaintly curly,
         Or as straight as a beadleâ€™s wand?
   That I failâ€™d to remark;â€”it was rather dark
      And shadowy round the pond.

      Then the hand that reposed so snugly
         In mineâ€”was it plump or spare?
      Was the countenance fair or ugly?
         Nay, children, you have me there!
   _My_ eyes were pâ€™raps blurrâ€™d; and besides Iâ€™d heard
      That itâ€™s horribly rude to stare.

      And Iâ€”was I brusque and surly?
         Or oppressively bland and fond?
      Was I partial to rising early?
         Or why did we twain abscond,
   All breakfastless too, from the public view
      To prowl by a misty pond?

      What passâ€™d, what was felt or spokenâ€”
         Whether anything passâ€™d at allâ€”
      And whether the heart was broken
         That beat under that sheltâ€™ring shawlâ€”
   (If shawl she had on, which I doubt)â€”has gone,
      Yes, gone from me past recall.

      Was I haply the ladyâ€™s suitor?
         Or her uncle?  I canâ€™t make outâ€”
      Ask your governess, dears, or tutor.
         For myself, Iâ€™m in hopeless doubt
   As to why we were there, who on earth we were,
      And what this is all about.




BALLAD.


   THE auld wife sat at her ivied door,
      (_Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_)
   A thing she had frequently done before;
      And her spectacles lay on her apronâ€™d knees.

   The piper he piped on the hill-top high,
      (_Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_)
   Till the cow said â€œI die,â€ and the goose askâ€™d â€œWhy?â€
      And the dog said nothing, but searchâ€™d for fleas.

   The farmer he strode through the square farmyard;
      (_Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_)
   His last brew of ale was a trifle hardâ€”
      The connexion of which with the plot one sees.

   The farmerâ€™s daughter hath frank blue eyes;
      (_Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_)
   She hears the rooks caw in the windy skies,
      As she sits at her lattice and shells her peas.

   The farmerâ€™s daughter hath ripe red lips;
      (_Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_)
   If you try to approach her, away she skips
      Over tables and chairs with apparent ease.

   The farmerâ€™s daughter hath soft brown hair;
      (_Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_)
   And I met with a ballad, I canâ€™t say where,
      Which wholly consisted of lines like these.



PART II.


   She sat with her hands â€™neath her dimpled cheeks,
      (_Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_)
   And spake not a word.  While a lady speaks
      There is hope, but she didnâ€™t even sneeze.

   She sat, with her hands â€™neath her crimson cheeks;
      (_Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_)
   She gave up mending her fatherâ€™s breeks,
      And let the cat roll in her new chemise.

   She sat, with her hands â€™neath her burning cheeks,
      (_Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_)
   And gazed at the piper for thirteen weeks;
      Then she followâ€™d him out oâ€™er the misty leas.

   Her sheep followâ€™d her, as their tails did them.
      (_Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_)
   And this song is considerâ€™d a perfect gem,
      And as to the meaning, itâ€™s what you please.




PRECIOUS STONES.
AN INCIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY.


   MY Cherrystones!  I prize them,
      No tongue can tell how much!
   Each lady caller eyes them,
      And madly longs to touch!
   At eve I lift them down, I look
      Upon them, and I cry;
   Recalling how my Prince â€˜partookâ€™
      (Sweet word!) of cherry-pie!

   To me it was an Era
      In life, that Dejeuner!
   They ate, they sippâ€™d Madeira
      Much in the usual way.
   Many a soft item there would be,
      No doubt, upon the carte:
   But one made life a heaven to me:
      It was the cherry-tart.

   Lightly the spoonfuls enterâ€™d
      That mouth on which the gaze
   Of ten fair girls was centred
      In rapturous amaze.
   Soon that august assemblage clearâ€™d
      The dish; andâ€”as they ateâ€”
   The stones, all coyly, re-appearâ€™d
      On each illustrious plate.

   And when His Royal Highness
      Withdrew to take the air,
   Waiving our natural shyness,
      We swoopâ€™d upon his chair.
   Policemen at our garments clutchâ€™d:
      We mockâ€™d those feeble powers;
   And soon the treasures that had touchâ€™d
      Exalted lips were ours!

   One large oneâ€”at the moment
      It seemâ€™d almost divineâ€”
   Was got by that Miss Beaumont:
      And three, O three, are mine!
   Yes! the three stones that rest beneath
      Glass, on that plain deal shelf,
   Stranger, once dallied with the teeth
      Of Royalty itself.

   Let Parliament abolish
      Churches and States and Thrones:
   With reverent hand Iâ€™ll polish
      Still, still my Cherrystones!
   A clodâ€”a piece of orange-peel
      An end of a cigarâ€”
   Once trod on by a Princely heel,
      How beautiful they are!

   Years since, I climbâ€™d Saint Michael
      His Mount:â€”youâ€™ll all go there
   Of course, and those who likeâ€™ll
      Sit in Saint Michaelâ€™s Chair:
   For there I saw, within a frame,
      The penâ€”O heavens! the penâ€”
   With which a Duke had signâ€™d his name,
      And other gentlemen.

   â€œGreat among geese,â€ I faltered,
      â€œIs she who grew that quill!â€
   And, Deathless Bird, unalterâ€™d
      Is mine opinion still.
   Yet sometimes, as I view my three
      Stones with a thoughtful brow,
   I think there possibly might be
      Eâ€™en greater geese than thou.




DISASTER.


   â€™TWAS ever thus from childhoodâ€™s hour!
      My fondest hopes would not decay:
   I never loved a tree or flower
      Which was the first to fade away!
   The garden, where I used to delve
      Short-frockâ€™d, still yields me pinks in plenty:
   The peartree that I climbâ€™d at twelve
      I see still blossoming, at twenty.

   I never nursed a dear gazelle;
      But I was given a parroquetâ€”
   (How I did nurse him if unwell!)
      Heâ€™s imbecile, but lingers yet.
   Heâ€™s green, with an enchanting tuft;
      He melts me with his small black eye:
   Heâ€™d look inimitable stuffâ€™d,
      And knows itâ€”but he will not die!

   I had a kittenâ€”I was rich
      In petsâ€”but all too soon my kitten
   Became a full-sized cat, by which
      Iâ€™ve more than once been scratchâ€™d and bitten.
   And when for sleep her limbs she curlâ€™d
      One day beside her untouchâ€™d plateful,
   And glided calmly from the world,
      I freely own that I was grateful.

   And then I bought a dogâ€”a queen!
      Ah Tiny, dear departing pug!
   She lives, but she is past sixteen
      And scarce can crawl across the rug.
   I loved her beautiful and kind;
      Delighted in her pert Bow-wow:
   But now she snaps if you donâ€™t mind;
      â€™Twere lunacy to love her now.

   I used to think, should eâ€™er mishap
      Betide my crumple visaged Ti,
   In shape of prowling thief, or trap,
      Or coarse bull-terrierâ€”I should die.
   But ah! disasters have their use;
      And life might eâ€™en be too sunshiny:
   Nor would I make myself a goose,
      If some big dog should swallow Tiny.




CONTENTMENT.
AFTER THE MANNER OF HORACE.


   FRIEND, there be they on whom mishap
      Or never or so rarely comes,
   That, when they think thereof, they snap
         Derisive thumbs:

   And there be they who lightly lose
      Their all, yet feel no aching void;
   Should aught annoy them, they refuse
         To be annoyâ€™d:

   And fain would I be eâ€™en as these!
      Life is with such all beer and skittles;
   They are not difficult to please
         About their victuals:

   The trout, the grouse, the early pea,
      By such, if there, are freely taken;
   If not, they munch with equal glee
         Their bit of bacon:

   And when they wax a little gay
      And chaff the public after luncheon,
   If theyâ€™re confronted with a stray
         Policemanâ€™s truncheon,

   They gaze thereat with outstretchâ€™d necks,
      And laughter which no threats can smother,
   And tell the horror-stricken X
         That heâ€™s another.

   In snowtime if they cross a spot
      Where unsuspected boys have slid,
   They fall not downâ€”though they would not
         Mind if they did:

   When the spring rosebud which they wear
      Breaks short and tumbles from its stem,
   No thought of being angry eâ€™er
         Dawns upon them;

   Though â€™twas Jemimaâ€™s hand that placed,
      (As well you ween) at eveningâ€™s hour,
   In the loved button-hole that chaste
         And cherishâ€™d flower.

   And when they travel, if they find
      That they have left their pocket-compass
   Or Murray or thick boots behind,
         They raise no rumpus,

   But plod serenely on without:
      Knowing itâ€™s better to endure
   The evil which beyond all doubt
         You cannot cure.

   When for that early train theyâ€™re late,
      They do not make their woes the text
   Of sermons in the Times, but wait
         On for the next;

   And jump inside, and only grin
      Should it appear that that dry wag,
   The guard, omitted to put in
         Their carpet-bag.




THE SCHOOLMASTER
ABROAD WITH HIS SON.


   O WHAT harper could worthily harp it,
      Mine Edward! this wide-stretching wold
   (Look out _wold_) with its wonderful carpet
      Of emerald, purple, and gold!
   Look well at itâ€”also look sharp, it
         Is getting so cold.

   The purple is heather (_erica_);
      The yellow, gorseâ€”callâ€™d sometimes â€œwhin.â€
   Cruel boys on its prickles might spike a
      Green beetle as if on a pin.
   You may roll in it, if you would like a
         Few holes in your skin.

   You wouldnâ€™t?  Then think of how kind you
      Should be to the insects who crave
   Your compassionâ€”and then, look behind you
      At you barley-ears!  Donâ€™t they look brave
   As they undulateâ€”(_undulate_, mind you,
         From _unda_, _a wave_).

   The noise of those sheep-bells, how faint it
      Sounds hereâ€”(on account of our height)!
   And this hillock itselfâ€”who could paint it,
      With its changes of shadow and light?
   Is it notâ€”(never, Eddy, say â€œainâ€™t itâ€)â€”
         A marvellous sight?

   Then yon desolate eerie morasses,
      The haunts of the snipe and the hernâ€”
   (I shall question the two upper classes
      On _aquatiles_, when we return)â€”
   Why, I see on them absolute masses
         Of _filix_ or fern.

   How it interests eâ€™en a beginner
      (Or _tiro_) like dear little Ned!
   Is he listening?  As I am a sinner
      Heâ€™s asleepâ€”he is wagging his head.
   Wake up!  Iâ€™ll go home to my dinner,
         And you to your bed.

   The boundless ineffable prairie;
      The splendour of mountain and lake
   With their hues that seem ever to vary;
      The mighty pine-forests which shake
   In the wind, and in which the unwary
         May tread on a snake;

   And this wold with its heathery garmentâ€”
      Are themes undeniably great.
   Butâ€”although there is not any harm inâ€™tâ€”
      Itâ€™s perhaps little good to dilate
   On their charms to a dull little varmint
         Of seven or eight.




ARCADES AMBO.


      WHY are ye wandering aye â€™twixt porch and porch,
         Thou and thy fellowâ€”when the pale stars fade
      At dawn, and when the glowworm lights her torch,
         O Beadle of the Burlington Arcade?
         â€”Who asketh why the Beautiful was made?
      A wan cloud drifting oâ€™er the waste of blue,
         The thistledown that floats above the glade,
      The lilac-blooms of Aprilâ€”fair to view,
   And naught but fair are these; and such, I ween, are you.

      Yes, ye are beautiful.  The young street boys
         Joy in your beauty.  Are ye there to bar
      Their pathway to that paradise of toys,
         Ribbons and rings?  Whoâ€™ll blame ye if ye are?
         Surely no shrill and clattering crowd should mar
      The dim aisleâ€™s stillness, where in noonâ€™s mid-glow
         Trip fair-hairâ€™d girls to boot-shop or bazaar;
      Where, at soft eve, serenely to and fro
   The sweet boy-graduates walk, nor deem the pastime slow.

      And O! forgive me, Beadles, if I paid
         Scant tribute to your worth, when first ye stood
      Before me robed in broadcloth and brocade
         And all the nameless grace of Beadlehood!
         I would not smile at yeâ€”if smile I could
      Now as erewhile, ere I had learnâ€™d to sigh:
         Ah, no!  I know ye beautiful and good,
      And evermore will pause as I pass by,
   And gaze, and gazing think, how base a thing am I.




WAITING.


   â€œO COME, O come,â€ the mother prayâ€™d
      And hushâ€™d her babe: â€œlet me behold
   Once more thy stately form arrayâ€™d
      Like autumn woods in green and gold!

   â€œI see thy brethren come and go;
      Thy peers in stature, and in hue
   Thy rivals.  Same like monarchs glow
      With richest purple: some are blue

   â€œAs skies that tempt the swallow back;
      Or red as, seen oâ€™er wintry seas,
   The star of storm; or barrâ€™d with black
      And yellow, like the April bees.

   â€œCome they and go!  I heed not, I.
      Yet others hail their advent, cling
   All trustful to their side, and fly
      Safe in their gentle piloting

   â€œTo happy homes on heath or hill,
      By park or river.  Still I wait
   And peer into the darkness: still
      Thou comâ€™st notâ€”I am desolate.

   â€œHush! hark!  I see a towering form!
      From the dim distance slowly rollâ€™d
   It rocks like lilies in a storm,
      And O, its hues are green and gold:

   â€œIt comes, it comes!  Ah rest is sweet,
      And there is rest, my babe, for us!â€
   She ceased, as at her very feet
      Stoppâ€™d the St. Johnâ€™s Wood omnibus.




PLAY.


   PLAY, play, while as yet it is day:
   While the sweet sunlight is warm on the brae!
   Hark to the lark singing lay upon lay,
   While the brown squirrel eats nuts on the spray
   And in the apple-leaves chatters the jay!
   Play, play, even as they!
   What though the cowslips ye pluck will decay,
   What though the grass will be presently hay?
   What though the noise that ye make should dismay
   Old Mrs. Clutterbuck over the way?
   Play, play, for your locks will grow gray;
   Even the marbles ye sport with are clay.

      Play, ay in the crowded highway:
   Was it not made for you?  Yea, my lad, yea.
   True that the babes you were bid to convey
   Home may fall out or be stolen or stray;
   True that the tip-cat you toss about may
   Strike an old gentleman, cause him to sway,
   Stumble, and pâ€™raps be run oâ€™er by a dray:
   Still why delay?  Play, my son, play!
   Barclay and Perkins, not you, have to pay.

      Play, play, your sonatas in A,
   Heedless of what your next neighbour may say!
   Dance and be gay as a faun or a fay,
   Sing like the lad in the boat on the bay;
   Sing, playâ€”if your neighbours inveigh
   Feebly against you, theyâ€™re lunatics, eh?
   Bang, twang, clatter and clang,
   Strum, thrum, upon fiddle and drum;
   Neigh, bray, simply obey
   All your sweet impulses, stop not or stay!
   Rattle the â€œbones,â€ hit a tinbottomâ€™d tray
   Hard with the fireshovel, hammer away!
   Is not your neighbour your natural prey?
   Should he confound you, itâ€™s only in play.




LOVE.


   CANST thou love me, lady?
      Iâ€™ve not learnâ€™d to woo:
   Thou art on the shady
      Side of sixty too.
   Still I love thee dearly!
      Thou hast lands and pelf:
   But I love thee merely
      Merely for thyself.

   Wilt thou love me, fairest?
      Though thou art not fair;
   And I think thou wearest
      Someone-elseâ€™s hair.
   Thou couldâ€™st love, though, dearly:
      And, as I am told,
   Thou art very nearly
      Worth thy weight, in gold.

   Dost thou love me, sweet one?
      Tell me that thou dost!
   Women fairly beat one,
      But I think thou must.
   Thou art loved so dearly:
      I am plain, but then
   Thou (to speak sincerely)
      Art as plain again.

   Love me, bashful fairy!
      Iâ€™ve an empty purse:
   And Iâ€™ve â€œmoods,â€ which vary;
      Mostly for the worse.
   Still, I love thee dearly:
      Though I make (I feel)
   Love a little queerly,
      Iâ€™m as true as steel.

   Love me, swear to love me
      (As, you know, they do)
   By yon heaven above me
      And its changeless blue.
   Love me, lady, dearly,
      If youâ€™ll be so good;
   Though I donâ€™t see clearly
      On what ground you should.

   Love meâ€”ah or love me
      Not, but be my bride!
   Do not simply shove me
      (So to speak) aside!
   Pâ€™raps it would be dearly
      Purchased at the price;
   But a hundred yearly
      Would be very nice.




THOUGHTS AT A RAILWAY STATION.


   â€™TIS but a box, of modest deal;
      Directed to no matter where:
   Yet down my cheek the teardrops stealâ€”
   Yes, I am blubbering like a seal;
   For on it is this mute appeal,
         â€œ_With care_.â€

   I am a stern cold man, and range
      Apart: but those vague words â€œ_With care_â€
   Wake yearnings in me sweet as strange:
   Drawn from my moral Moated Grange,
   I feel I rather like the change
         Of air.

   Hast thou neâ€™er seen rough pointsmen spy
      Some simple English phraseâ€”â€œ_With care_â€
   Or â€œ_This side uppermost_â€â€”and cry
   Like children?  No?  No more have I.
   Yet deem not him whose eyes are dry
         A bear.

   But ah! what treasure hides beneath
      That lid so much the worse for wear?
   A ring perhapsâ€”a rosy wreathâ€”
   A photograph by Vernon Heathâ€”
   Some matronâ€™s temporary teeth
         Or hair!

   Perhaps some seaman, in Peru
      Or Ind, hath stowâ€™d herein a rare
   Cargo of birdsâ€™ eggs for his Sue;
   With many a vow that heâ€™ll be true,
   And many a hint that she is too,
         Too fair.

   Perhapsâ€”but wherefore vainly pry
      Into the page thatâ€™s folded there?
   I shall be better by and by:
   The porters, as I sit and sigh,
   Pass and repassâ€”I wonder why
         They stare!




ON THE BRINK.


   I WATCHâ€™D her as she stoopâ€™d to pluck
      A wildflower in her hair to twine;
   And wishâ€™d that it had been my luck
         To call her mine.

   Anon I heard her rate with mad
      Mad words her babe within its cot;
   And felt particularly glad
         That it had not.

   I knew (such subtle brains have men)
      That she was uttering what she shouldnâ€™t;
   And thought that I would chide, and then
         I thought I wouldnâ€™t:

   Who could have gazed upon that face,
      Those pouting coral lips, and chided?
   A Rhadamanthus, in my place,
         Had done as I did:

   For ire wherewith our bosoms glow
      Is chainâ€™d there oft by Beautyâ€™s spell;
   And, more than that, I did not know
         The widow well.

   So the harsh phrase passâ€™d unreproved.
      Still muteâ€”(O brothers, was it sin?)â€”
   I drank, unutterably moved,
         Her beauty in:

   And to myself I murmurâ€™d low,
      As on her upturnâ€™d face and dress
   The moonlight fell, â€œWould she say No,
         By chance, or Yes?â€

   She stood so calm, so like a ghost
      Betwixt me and that magic moon,
   That I already was almost
         A finishâ€™d coon.

   But when she caught adroitly up
      And soothed with smiles her little daughter;
   And gave it, if Iâ€™m right, a sup
         Of barley-water;

   And, crooning still the strange sweet lore
      Which only mothersâ€™ tongues can utter,
   Snowâ€™d with deft hand the sugar oâ€™er
         Its bread and butter;

   And kissâ€™d it clinginglyâ€”(Ah, why
      Donâ€™t women do these things in private?)â€”
   I felt that if I lost her, I
         Should not survive it:

   And from my mouth the words nigh flewâ€”
      The past, the future, I forgat â€™em:
   â€œOh! if youâ€™d kiss me as you do
         That thankless atom!â€

   But this thought came ere yet I spake,
      And froze the sentence on my lips:
   â€œThey err, who marry wives that make
         Those little slips.â€

   It came like some familiar rhyme,
      Some copy to my boyhood set;
   And thatâ€™s perhaps the reason Iâ€™m
         Unmarried yet.

   Would she have ownâ€™d how pleased she was,
      And told her love with widowâ€™s pride?
   I never found out that, because
         I never tried.

   Be kind to babes and beasts and birds:
      Hearts may be hard, though lips are coral;
   And angry words are angry words:
         And thatâ€™s the moral.




â€œFOREVER.â€


   FOREVER; â€™tis a single word!
      Our rude forefathers deemâ€™d it two:
   Can you imagine so absurd
         A view?

   Forever!  What abysms of woe
      The word reveals, what frenzy, what
   Despair!  For ever (printed so)
         Did not.

   It looks, ah me! how trite and tame!
      It fails to sadden or appal
   Or solaceâ€”it is not the same
         At all.

   O thou to whom it first occurrâ€™d
      To solder the disjoinâ€™d, and dower
   Thy native language with a word
         Of power:

   We bless thee!  Whether far or near
      Thy dwelling, whether dark or fair
   Thy kingly brow, is neither here
         Nor there.

   But in menâ€™s hearts shall be thy throne,
      While the great pulse of England beats:
   Thou coiner of a word unknown
         To Keats!

   And nevermore must printer do
      As men did long ago; but run
   â€œForâ€ into â€œever,â€ bidding two
         Be one.

   Forever! passion-fraught, it throws
      Oâ€™er the dim page a gloom, a glamour:
   Itâ€™s sweet, itâ€™s strange; and I suppose
         Itâ€™s grammar.

   Forever!  â€™Tis a single word!
      And yet our fathers deemâ€™d it two:
   Nor am I confident they errâ€™d;
         Are you?




UNDER THE TREES.


   â€œUNDER the trees!â€  Who but agrees
   That there is magic in words such as these?
   Promptly one sees shake in the breeze
   Stately lime-avenues haunted of bees:
   Where, looking far over buttercuppâ€™d leas,
   Lads and â€œfair shesâ€ (that is Byron, and heâ€™s
   An authority) lie very much at their ease;
   Taking their teas, or their duck and green peas,
   Or, if they prefer it, their plain bread and cheese:
   Not objecting at all though itâ€™s rather a squeeze
   And the glass is, I daresay, at 80 degrees.
   Some get up glees, and are mad about Ries
   And Sainton, and Tamberlikâ€™s thrilling high Cs;
   Or if painters, hold forth upon Hunt and Maclise,
   And the tone and the breadth of that landscape of Leeâ€™s;
   Or if learned, on nodes and the moonâ€™s apogees,
   Or, if serious, on something of AKHBâ€™s,
   Or the latest attempt to convert the Chaldees;
   Or in short about all things, from earthquakes to fleas.
   Some sit in twos or (less frequently) threes,
   With their innocent lambswool or book on their knees,
   And talk, and enact, any nonsense you please,
   As they gaze into eyes that are blue as the seas;
   And you hear an occasional â€œHarry, donâ€™t teaseâ€
   From the sweetest of lips in the softest of keys,
   And other remarks, which to me are Chinese.
   And fast the time flees; till a ladylike sneeze,
   Or a portly papaâ€™s more elaborate wheeze,
   Makes Miss Tabitha seize on her brown muffatees,
   And announce as a fact that itâ€™s going to freeze,
   And that young people ought to attend to their Ps
   And their Qs, and not court every form of disease:
   Then Tommy eats up the three last ratafias,
   And pretty Louise wraps her _robe de cerise_
   Round a bosom as tender as Widow Machreeâ€™s,
   And (in spite of the pleas of her lorn vis-a-vis)
   Goes to wrap up her uncleâ€”a patient of Skeyâ€™s,
   Who is prone to catch chills, like all old Bengalese:â€”
   But at bedtime I trust heâ€™ll remember to grease
   The bridge of his nose, and preserve his rupees
   From the premature clutch of his fond legatees;
   Or at least have no fees to pay any M. D.s
   For the cold his niece caught, sitting under the Trees.




MOTHERHOOD.


   SHE laid it where the sunbeams fall
   Unscannâ€™d upon the broken wall.
   Without a tear, without a groan,
   She laid it near a mighty stone,
   Which some rude swain had haply cast
   Thither in sport, long ages past,
   And Time with mosses had oâ€™erlaid,
   And fenced with many a tall grassblade,
   And all about bid roses bloom
   And violets shed their soft perfume.
   There, in its cool and quiet bed,
   She set her burden down and fled:
   Nor flung, all eager to escape,
   One glance upon the perfect shape
   That lay, still warm and fresh and fair,
   But motionless and soundless there.

      No human eye had markâ€™d her pass
   Across the linden-shadowâ€™d grass
   Ere yet the minster clock chimed seven:
   Only the innocent birds of heavenâ€”
   The magpie, and the rook whose nest
   Swings as the elmtree waves his crestâ€”
   And the lithe cricket, and the hoar
   And huge-limbâ€™d hound that guards the door,
   Lookâ€™d on when, as a summer wind
   That, passing, leaves no trace behind,
   All unapparellâ€™d, barefoot all,
   She ran to that old ruinâ€™d wall,
   To leave upon the chill dank earth
   (For ah! she never knew its worth)
   â€™Mid hemlock rank, and fern, and ling,
   And dews of night, that precious thing!

      And there it might have lain forlorn
   From morn till eve, from eve to morn:
   But that, by some wild impulse led,
   The mother, ere she turnâ€™d and fled,
   One moment stood erect and high;
   Then pourâ€™d into the silent sky
   A cry so jubilant, so strange,
   That Aliceâ€”as she strove to range
   Her rebel ringlets at her glassâ€”
   Sprang up and gazed across the grass;
   Shook back those curls so fair to see,
   Clappâ€™d her soft hands in childish glee;
   And shriekâ€™dâ€”her sweet face all aglow,
      Her very limbs with rapture shakingâ€”
   â€œMy hen has laid an egg, I know;
      â€œAnd only hear the noise sheâ€™s making!â€




MYSTERY.


   I KNOW not if in othersâ€™ eyes
      She seemâ€™d almost divine;
   But far beyond a doubt it lies
      That she did not in mine.

   Each common stone on which she trod
      I did not deem a pearl:
   Nay it is not a little odd
      How I abhorrâ€™d that girl.

   We met at balls and picnics oft,
      Or on a drawingroom stair;
   My aunt invariably coughâ€™d
      To warn me she was there:

   At croquet I was bid remark
      How queenly was her pose,
   As with stern glee she drew the dark
      Blue ball beneath her toes,

   And made the Red fly many a foot:
      Then calmly she would stoop,
   Smiling an angel smile, to put
      A partner through his hoop.

   At archery I was made observe
      That others aimâ€™d more near.
   But none so tenderly could curve
      The elbow round the ear:

   Or if we rode, perhaps she _did_
      Pull sharply at the curb;
   But then the way in which she slid
      From horseback was superb!

   Sheâ€™d throw off odes, again, whose flow
      And fire were more than Sapphic;
   Her voice was sweet, and very low;
      Her singing quite seraphic:

   She _was_ a seraph, lacking wings.
      That much I freely own.
   But, it is one of those queer things
      Whose cause is all unknownâ€”

   (Such are the wasp, the household fly,
      The shapes that crawl and curl
   By men called centipedes)â€”that I
      Simply abhorred that girl.

                                  * * *

   No doubt some mystery underlies
      All things which are and which are not:
   And â€™tis the function of the Wise
      Not to expound to us what is what,

   But let his consciousness play round
      The matter, and at ease evolve
   The problem, shallow or profound,
      Which our poor wits have failâ€™d to solve,

   Then tell us blandly we are fools;
      Whereof we were aware before:
   That truth they taught us at the schools,
      And pâ€™raps (who knows?) a little more.

   â€”But why did we two disagree?
      Our tastes, it may be, did not dovetail:
   All I know is, we neâ€™er shall be
      Hero and heroine of a love-tale.




FLIGHT.


   O MEMORY! that which I gave thee
      To guard in thy garner yestreenâ€”
   Little deeming thou eâ€™er couldâ€™st behave thee
      Thus baselyâ€”hath gone from thee clean!
   Gone, fled, as ere autumn is ended
      The yellow leaves flee from the oakâ€”
   I have lost it for ever, my splendid
         Original joke.

   What was it?  I know I was brushing
      My hair when the notion occurred:
   I know that I felt myself blushing
      As I thought, â€œHow supremely absurd!
   â€œHow theyâ€™ll hammer on floor and on table
      â€œAs its drollery dawns on themâ€”how
   They will quote itâ€â€”I wish I were able
         To quote it just now.

   I had thought to lead up conversation
      To the subjectâ€”itâ€™s easily doneâ€”
   Then let off, as an airy creation
      Of the moment, that masterly pun.
   Let it off, with a flash like a rocketâ€™s;
      In the midst of a dazzled conclave,
   Where I sat, with my hands in my pockets,
         The only one grave.

   I had fancied young Tittertonâ€™s chuckles,
      And old Bottlebyâ€™s hearty guffaws
   As he drove at my ribs with his knuckles,
      His mode of expressing applause:
   While Jean Bottlebyâ€”queenly Miss Janetâ€”
      Drew her handkerchief hastily out,
   In fits at my slynessâ€”what can it
         Have all been about?

   I know â€™twas the happiest, quaintest
      Combination of pathos and fun:
   But Iâ€™ve got no ideaâ€”the faintestâ€”
      Of what was the actual pun.
   I think it was somehow connected
      With something Iâ€™d recently readâ€”
   Or heardâ€”or perhaps recollected
         On going to bed.

   What _had_ I been reading?  The _Standard_:
      â€œDouble Bigamy;â€ â€œSpeech of the Mayor.â€
   And laterâ€”eh? yes!  I meandered
      Through some chapters of Vanity Fair.
   How it fuses the grave with the festive!
      Yet eâ€™en there, there is nothing so fineâ€”
   So playfully, subtly suggestiveâ€”
         As that joke of mine.

   Did it hinge upon â€œparting asunder?â€
      No, I donâ€™t part my hair with my brush.
   Was the point of it â€œhair?â€  Now I wonder!
      Stop a bitâ€”I shall think of itâ€”hush!
   Thereâ€™s _hare_, a wild animalâ€”Stuff!
      It was something a deal more recondite:
   Of that I am certain enough;
         And of nothing beyond it.

   Hairâ€”_locks_!  There are probably many
      Good things to be said about those.
   Give me timeâ€”thatâ€™s the best guess of anyâ€”
      â€œLockâ€ has several meanings, one knows.
   Iron locksâ€”_iron-gray locks_â€”a â€œdeadlockâ€â€”
      That would set up an everyday wit:
   Then of course thereâ€™s the obvious â€œwedlock;â€
         But that wasnâ€™t it.

   No! mine was a joke for the ages;
      Full of intricate meaning and pith;
   A feast for your scholars and sagesâ€”
      How it would have rejoiced Sidney Smith!
   â€™Tis such thoughts that ennoble a mortal;
      And, singing him out from the herd,
   Fling wide immortalityâ€™s portalâ€”
         But what was the word?

   Ah me! â€™tis a bootless endeavour.
      As the flight of a bird of the air
   Is the flight of a jokeâ€”you will never
      See the same one again, you may swear.
   â€™Twas my firstborn, and O how I prized it!
      My darling, my treasure, my own!
   This brain and none other devised itâ€”
         And now it has flown.




ON THE BEACH.
LINES BY A PRIVATE TUTOR.


      WHEN the young Augustus Edward
      Has reluctantly gone bedward
   (Heâ€™s the urchin I am privileged to teach),
      From my left-hand waistcoat pocket
      I extract a batterâ€™d locket
   And I commune with it, walking on the beach.

      I had often yearnâ€™d for something
      That would love me, eâ€™en a dumb thing;
   But such happiness seemâ€™d always out of reach:
      Little boys are off like arrows
      With their little spades and barrows,
   When they see me bearing down upon the beach;

      And although Iâ€™m rather handsome,
      Tiny babes, when I would dance â€™em
   On my arm, set up so horrible a screech
      That I pitch them to their nurses
      With (I fear me) mutterâ€™d curses,
   And resume my lucubrations on the beach.

      And the rabbits wonâ€™t come nigh me,
      And the gulls observe and fly me,
   And I doubt, upon my honour, if a leech
      Would stick on me as on others,
      And I know if I had brothers
   They would cut me when we met upon the beach.

      So at last I bought this trinket.
      For (although I love to think it)
   â€™Twasnâ€™t _given_ me, with a pretty little speech:
      No!  I bought it of a pedlar,
      Brown and wizenâ€™d as a medlar,
   Who was hawking odds and ends about the beach.

      But Iâ€™ve managed, very nearly,
      To believe that I was dearly
   Loved by Somebody, who (blushing like a peach)
      Flung it oâ€™er me saying, â€œWear it
      For my sakeâ€â€”and I declare, it
   Seldom strikes me that I bought it on the beach.

      I can see myself revealing
      Unsuspected depths of feeling,
   As, in tones that half upbraid and half beseech,
      I aver with what delight I
      Would give anythingâ€”my right eyeâ€”
   For a souvenir of our stroll upon the beach.

      O! that eye that never glistenâ€™d
      And that voice to which Iâ€™ve listenâ€™d
   But in fancy, how I dote upon them each!
      How regardless what oâ€™clock it
      Is, I pore upon that locket
   Which does not contain her portrait, on the beach!

      As if something were inside it
      I laboriously hide it,
   And a rather pretty sermon you might preach
      Upon Fantasy, selecting
      For your â€œinstanceâ€ the affecting
   Tale of me and my proceedings on the beach.

      I depict her, ah, how charming!
      I portray myself alarming
   Herby swearing I would â€œmount the deadly breach,â€
      Or engage in any scrimmage
      For a glimpse of her sweet image,
   Or her shadow, or her footprint on the beach.

      And Iâ€™m ever ever seeing
      My imaginary Being,
   And Iâ€™d rather that my marrowbones should bleach
      In the winds, than that a cruel
      Fate should snatch from me the jewel
   Which I bought for one and sixpence on the beach.




LOVERS, AND A REFLECTION.


   IN moss-prankt dells which the sunbeams flatter
      (And heaven it knoweth what that may mean:
   Meaning, however, is no great matter)
      Where woods are a-tremble, with rifts atween;

   Throâ€™ Godâ€™s own heather we wonnâ€™d together,
      I and my Willie (O love my love):
   I need hardly remark it was glorious weather,
      And flitterbats waverâ€™d alow, above:

   Boats were curtseying, rising, bowing,
      (Boats in that climate are so polite),
   And sands were a ribbon of green endowing,
      And O the sundazzle on bark and bight!

   Throâ€™ the rare red heather we danced together,
      (O love my Willie!) and smelt for flowers:
   I must mention again it was gorgeous weather,
      Rhymes are so scarce in this world of ours:â€”

   By rises that flushâ€™d with their purple favours,
      Throâ€™ becks that brattled oâ€™er grasses sheen,
   We walked and waded, we two young shavers,
      Thanking our stars we were both so green.

   We journeyed in parallels, I and Willie,
      In fortunate parallels!  Butterflies,
   Hid in weltering shadows of daffodilly
      Or marjoram, kept making peacock eyes:

   Songbirds darted about, some inky
      As coal, some snowy (I ween) as curds;
   Or rosy as pinks, or as roses pinkyâ€”
      They reck of no eerie To-come, those birds!

   But they skim over bents which the midstream washes,
      Or hang in the lift â€™neath a white cloudâ€™s hem;
   They need no parasols, no goloshes;
      And good Mrs. Trimmer she feedeth them.

   Then we thrid Godâ€™s cowslips (as erst His heather)
      That endowed the wan grass with their golden blooms;
   And snaptâ€”(it was perfectly charming weather)â€”
      Our fingers at Fate and her goddess-glooms:

   And Willie â€™gan sing (O, his notes were fluty;
      Wafts fluttered them out to the white-wingâ€™d sea)â€”
   Something made up of rhymes that have done much duty,
      Rhymes (better to put it) of â€œancientry:â€

   Bowers of flowers encounterâ€™d showers
      In Williamâ€™s carolâ€”(O love my Willie!)
   Then he bade sorrow borrow from blithe to-morrow
      I quite forget whatâ€”say a daffodilly:

   A nest in a hollow, â€œwith buds to follow,â€
      I think occurred next in his nimble strain;
   And clay that was â€œkneadenâ€ of course in Edenâ€”
      A rhyme most novel, I do maintain:

   Mists, bones, the singer himself, love-stories,
      And all least furlable things got â€œfurled;â€
   Not with any design to conceal their â€œglories,â€
      But simply and solely to rhyme with â€œworld.â€

                                  * * *

   O if billows and pillows and hours and flowers,
      And all the brave rhymes of an elder day,
   Could be furled together, this genial weather,
      And carted, or carried on â€œwaftsâ€ away,
   Nor ever again trotted outâ€”ah me!
   How much fewer volumes of verse thereâ€™d be!




THE COCK AND THE BULL.


   YOU see this pebble-stone?  Itâ€™s a thing I bought
   Of a bit of a chit of a boy iâ€™ the mid oâ€™ the dayâ€”
   I like to dock the smaller parts-oâ€™-speech,
   As we curtail the already cur-tailâ€™d cur
   (You catch the paronomasia, play â€™poâ€™ words?)
   Did, rather, iâ€™ the pre-Landseerian days.
   Well, to my muttons.  I purchased the concern,
   And clapt it iâ€™ my poke, having given for same
   By way oâ€™ chop, swop, barter or exchangeâ€”
   â€˜Chopâ€™ was my snickering dandipratâ€™s own termâ€”
   One shilling and fourpence, current coin oâ€™ the realm.
   O-n-e one and f-o-u-r four
   Pence, one and fourpenceâ€”you are with me, sir?â€”
   What hour it skills not: ten or eleven oâ€™ the clock,
   One day (and what a roaring day it was
   Go shop or sight-seeâ€”bar a spit oâ€™ rain!)
   In February, eighteen sixty nine,
   Alexandrina Victoria, Fidei
   Hmâ€”hmâ€”how runs the jargon? being on throne.

      Such, sir, are all the facts, succinctly put,
   The basis or substratumâ€”what you willâ€”
   Of the impending eighty thousand lines.
   â€œNot much in â€™em either,â€ quoth perhaps simple Hodge.
   But thereâ€™s a superstructure.  Wait a bit.

   Mark first the rationale of the thing:
   Hear logic rivel and levigate the deed.
   That shillingâ€”and for matter oâ€™ that, the penceâ€”
   I had oâ€™ course upoâ€™ meâ€”wiâ€™ me sayâ€”
   (_Mecumâ€™s_ the Latin, make a note oâ€™ that)
   When I poppâ€™d pen iâ€™ stand, scratchâ€™d ear, wiped snout,
   (Let everybody wipe his own himself)
   Sniffâ€™dâ€”tch!â€”at snuffbox; tumbled up, he-heed,
   Haw-hawâ€™d (not hee-hawâ€™d, thatâ€™s another guess thing:)
   Then fumbled at, and stumbled out of, door,
   I shoved the timber ope wiâ€™ my omoplat;
   And _in vestibulo_, iâ€™ the lobby to-wit,
   (Iacobi Facciolatiâ€™s rendering, sir,)
   Donnâ€™d galligaskins, antigropeloes,
   And so forth; and, complete with hat and gloves,
   One on and one a-dangle iâ€™ my hand,
   And ombrifuge (Lord love you!), case oâ€™ rain,
   I floppâ€™d forth, â€™sbuddikins! on my own ten toes,
   (I do assure you there be ten of them),
   And went clump-clumping up hill and down dale
   To find myself oâ€™ the sudden iâ€™ front oâ€™ the boy.
   Put case I hadnâ€™t â€™em on me, could I haâ€™ bought
   This sort-oâ€™-kind-oâ€™-what-you-might-call toy,
   This pebble-thing, oâ€™ the boy-thing?  Q. E. D.
   Thatâ€™s proven without aid from mumping Pope,
   Sleek porporate or bloated Cardinal.
   (Isnâ€™t it, old Fatchaps?  Youâ€™re in Euclid now.)
   So, having the shillingâ€”having iâ€™ fact a lotâ€”
   And pence and halfpence, ever so many oâ€™ them,
   I purchased, as I think I said before,
   The pebble (_lapis_, _lapidis_, _-di_, _-dem_, _-de_â€”
   What nouns â€™crease short iâ€™ the genitive, Fatchaps, eh?)
   Oâ€™ the boy, a bare-leggâ€™d beggarly son of a gun,
   For one-and-fourpence.  Here we are again.

      Now Law steps in, bigwiggâ€™d, voluminous-jawâ€™d;
   Investigates and re-investigates.
   Was the transaction illegal?  Law shakes head.
   Perpend, sir, all the bearings of the case.

      At first the coin was mine, the chattel his.
   But now (by virtue of the said exchange
   And barter) _vice versa_ all the coin,
   _Per juris operationem_, vests
   Iâ€™ the boy and his assigns till ding oâ€™ doom;
   (_In sÃ¦cula sÃ¦culo-o-o-orum_;
   I think I hear the Abate mouth out that.)
   To have and hold the same to him and them . . .
   _Confer_ some idiot on Conveyancing.
   Whereas the pebble and every part thereof,
   And all that appertaineth thereunto,
   _Quodcunque pertinet ad eam rem_,
   (I fancy, sir, my Latinâ€™s rather pat)
   Or shall, will, may, might, can, could, would or should,
   (_Subaudi cÃ¦tera_â€”clap we to the closeâ€”
   For whatâ€™s the good of law in a case oâ€™ the kind)
   Is mine to all intents and purposes.
   This settled, I resume the thread oâ€™ the tale.

      Now for a touch oâ€™ the vendorâ€™s quality.
   He says a genâ€™lman bought a pebble of him,
   (This pebble iâ€™ sooth, sir, which I hold iâ€™ my hand)â€”
   And paid forâ€™t, _like_ a genâ€™lman, on the nail.
   â€œDid I oâ€™ercharge him a haâ€™penny?  Devil a bit.
   Fiddlepinâ€™s end!  Got out, you blazing ass!
   Gabble oâ€™ the goose.  Donâ€™t bugaboo-baby _me_!
   Go double or quits?  Yah! tittup! whatâ€™s the odds?â€
      Thereâ€™s the transaction viewâ€™d iâ€™ the vendorâ€™s light.

      Next ask that dumpled hag, stood snuffling by,
   With her three frowsy blowsy brats oâ€™ babes,
   The scum oâ€™ the kennel, cream oâ€™ the filth-heapâ€”Faugh!
   Aie, aie, aie, aie! oÏ„Î¿Ï„Î¿Ï„Î¿Ï„Î¿Ï„oÄ©,
   (â€™Stead which we blurt out Hoighty toighty now)â€”
   And the baker and candlestickmaker, and Jack and Gill,
   Blearâ€™d Goody this and queasy Gaffer that.
   Ask the schoolmaster.  Take schoolmaster first.

      He saw a gentleman purchase of a lad
   A stone, and pay for it _rite_, on the square,
   And carry it off _per saltum_, jauntily,
   _Propria quÃ¦ maribus_, gentlemanâ€™s property now
   (Agreeably to the law explainâ€™d above),
   _In proprium usum_, for his private ends.
   The boy he chuckâ€™d a brown iâ€™ the air, and bit
   Iâ€™ the face the shilling: heaved a thumping stone
   At a lean hen that ran cluck clucking by,
   (And hit her, dead as nail iâ€™ post oâ€™ door,)
   Then _abiit_â€”whatâ€™s the Ciceronian phrase?â€”
   _Excessit_, _evasit_, _erupit_â€”off slogs boy;
   Off like bird, _avi similis_â€”(you observed
   The dative?  Pretty iâ€™ the Mantuan!)â€”_Anglice_
   Off in three flea skips.  _Hactenus_, so far,
   So good, _tam bene_.  _Bene_, _satis_, _male_â€”,
   Where was I with my trope â€™bout one in a quag?
   I did once hitch the syntax into verse:
   _Verbum personale_, a verb personal,
   _Concordat_â€”ay, â€œagrees,â€ old Fatchapsâ€”_cum_
   _Nominativo_, with its nominative,
   _Genere_, iâ€™ point oâ€™ gender, _numero_,
   Oâ€™ number, _et persona_, and person.  _Ut_,
   Instance: _Sol ruit_, down flops sun, _et_ and,
   _Montes umbrantur_, out flounce mountains.  Pah!
   Excuse me, sir, I think Iâ€™m going mad.
   You see the trick onâ€™t though, and can yourself
   Continue the discourse _ad libitum_.
   It takes up about eighty thousand lines,
   A thing imagination boggles at:
   And might, odds-bobs, sir! in judicious hands,
   Extend from here to Mesopotamy.




AN EXAMINATION PAPER.


              â€œTHE POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF THE PICKWICK CLUB.â€

2.  Two of Jingleâ€™s speeches are here quoted, the first being in Chapter
III., and the second in Chapter II.  For â€œSpanish travellerâ€ see Chapter
III., and for â€œnarcotic bedsteadâ€ see Chapter XLI.  â€œGo on, Jemmy,â€ is
Mr. Jingleâ€™s adjuration to the actor whom he has previously designated
â€œDismal Jemmy,â€ urging the commencement of the â€˜Strollerâ€™s Tale.â€™  â€œLike
black-eyed Susanâ€”all in the Downsâ€ has the double application to the
strollerâ€™s melancholy and the first line of Gayâ€™s song of â€˜Black-eyed
Susanâ€™â€”â€œAll in the Downs the fleet was moored.â€  â€œHandled his fives wellâ€
of course refers to the â€œsparringâ€ of the cabman who wanted to fight Mr.
Pickwick.  â€œFriend in the green jemmyâ€ refers to Mr. Winkle, who, we are
told in Chapter I., â€œwore a new green shooting-coat,â€ &c.  â€œPigâ€™s
whisperâ€ is slang for a very brief space of time.  Bartlett says the
Americans have â€œpigâ€™s whistleâ€ the same signification.

to Robert Nixon, the Cheshire prophet.  See _Notes and Queries_, first
series, vol. viii., pp. 257 and 326; and fourth series, vol. xi., pp. 171
and 265.  Nixonâ€™s prophecies have been frequently published in the form

probably refers to the colour of dress-coats.  â€œWhich gentleman of your
party wears a bright blue dress-coat?â€ enquires The Boots, in â€˜Pickwick,â€™

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
