If it be to-morrow day,
Take your wings and fly away.

Because she can't work any faster.

And all the meat I got, I put upon the shelf;

The wheelbarrow broke, my wife got a fall,
Down tumbled wheelbarrow, little wife and all.

Looking as happy as happy could be,
Till a boy came by, with his bow and arrow,

Yet things break in and steal the gold.

To see the cold winter come in,
Tit for tat, what matter for that,
He'll hide his head under his wing!

Though not very long
Yet I think it
As pretty as any.

You'll never be worse
An give the poor singer
A penny.

Come again some April day,
Little Johnny wants to play.

When nobody's with me,
I am always alone.
