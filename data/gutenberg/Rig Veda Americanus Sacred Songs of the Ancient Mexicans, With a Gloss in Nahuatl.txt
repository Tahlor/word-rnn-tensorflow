No. VIII.
In accordance with the general object of this series of volumes--which
is to furnish materials for study rather than to offer completed
studies--I have prepared for this number the text of the most ancient
authentic record of American religious lore. From its antiquity and
character, I have ventured to call this little collection the RIG VEDA
AMERICANUS, after the similar cyclus of sacred hymns, which are the most
venerable product of the Aryan mind.
As for my attempted translation of these mystic chants I offer it with
the utmost reserve. It would be the height of temerity in me to pretend
to have overcome difficulties which one so familiar with the ancient
Nahuatl as Father Sahagun intimated were beyond his powers. All that I
hope to have achieved is, by the aid of the Gloss--and not always in
conformity to its suggestions--to give a general idea of the sense and
purport of the originals.
The desirability of preserving and publishing these texts seems to me to
be manifest. They reveal to us the undoubtedly authentic spirit of the
ancient religion; they show us the language in its most archaic form;
they preserve references to various mythical cycli of importance to the
historian; and they illustrate the alterations in the spoken tongue
adopted in the esoteric dialect of the priesthood. Such considerations
will, I trust, attract the attention of scholars to these fragments of a
lost literature.
In the appended Vocabulary I have inserted only those words and
expressions for which I can suggest correct--or, at least,
probable--renderings. Others will have to be left to future
investigators.

As in a previous number of the Library of Aboriginal American Literature
I have discussed in detail the character of the ancient Mexican poetry,
I shall confine myself at present to the history of the present
collection. We owe its preservation to the untiring industry of Father
Bernardino de Sahagun, one of the earliest missionaries to Mexico, and
the author of by far the most important work on the religion, manners
and customs of the ancient Mexicans.
By long residence and close application Sahagun acquired a complete
mastery of the Nahuatl tongue. He composed his celebrated _Historia de
las Cosas de la Nueva Espana_ primarily in the native language, and from
this original wrote out a Spanish translation, in some parts
considerably abbreviated. This incomplete reproduction is that which was
published in Spanish by Lord Kingsborough and Bustamente, and in a
French rendering with useful notes by Dr. Jourdanet and M. Remi Simeon.
So far as I know, the only complete copy of the Nahuatl original now in
existence is that preserved in the Bibliotheca Laurentio-Mediceana in
Florence, where I examined it in April, 1889. It is a most elaborate and
beautiful MS., in three large volumes, containing thirteen hundred and
seventy-eight illustrations, carefully drawn by hand, mostly colored,
illustrative of the native mythology, history, arts and usages, besides
many elaborate head and tail pieces to the chapters.
There is another Nahuatl MS. of Sahagun's history in the private
library of the King of Spain at Madrid, which I examined in May, 1888,
and of which I published a collation in the _Memoires de la Societe
Internationale des Americanistes_, for that year. It is incomplete,
embracing only the first six books of the _Historia_, and should be
considered merely as a _borrador_ or preliminary sketch for the
Florentine copy. It contains, however, a certain amount of material not
included in the latter, and has been peculiarly useful to me in the
preparation of the present volume, as not only affording another reading
of the text, valuable for comparison, but as furnishing a gloss or
Nahuatl paraphrase of most of the hymns, which does not appear in the
Florentine MS. As evidently the older of the two, I have adopted the
readings of the Madrid MS. as my text, and given the variants of the
Florentine MS. at the end of each hymn.
Neither MS. attempts any translation of the hymns. That at Madrid has no
Spanish comment whatever, while that at Florence places opposite the
hymns the following remarks, which are also found in the printed copies,
near the close of the Appendix of the Second Book of the _Historia_:--
"It is an old trick of our enemy the Devil to try to conceal himself in
order the better to compass his ends, in accordance with the words of
the Gospel, 'He whose deeds are evil, shuns the light.' Also on earth
this enemy of ours has provided himself with a dense wood and a ground,
rough and filled with abysses, there to prepare his wiles and to escape
pursuit, as do wild beasts and venomous serpents. This wood and these
abysses are the songs which he has inspired for his service to be sung
in his honor within the temples and outside of them; for they are so
artfully composed that they say what they will, but disclose only what
the Devil commands, not being rightly understood except by those to whom
they are addressed. It is, in fact, well recognized that the cave, wood
or abysses in which this cursed enemy hides himself, are these songs or
chants which he himself composed, and which are sung to him without
being understood except by those who are acquainted with this sort of
language. The consequence is that they sing what they please, war or
peace, praise to the Devil or contempt for Christ, and they cannot in
the least be understood by other men."
Lord Kingsborough says in a note in his voluminous work on the
_Antiquities of Mexico_ that this portion of Sahagun's text was
destroyed by order of the Inquisition, and that there was a memorandum
to that effect in the Spanish original in the noble writer's possession.
This could scarcely have referred to a translation of the hymns, for
none such exists in any MS. I have consulted, or heard of; and Sahagun
intimates in the passage quoted above that he had made none, on account
of the obscurity of the diction. Neither does any appear in the
Florentine MS., where the text of the hymns is given in full, although
the explanatory Gloss is omitted. This last-mentioned fact has prevented
me from correcting the text of the Gloss, which in some passages is
manifestly erroneous; but I have confined myself to reproducing it
strictly according to the original MS., leaving its correction to those
who will make use of it.
The Florentine MS. has five colored illustrations of the divinities, or
their symbols, which are spoken of in the chants. These are probably
copied from the native hieroglyphic books in which, as we learn from
Sahagun, such ancient songs were preserved and transmitted. These
illustrations I had copied with scrupulous fidelity and reproduced by
one of the photographic processes, for the present work.
Such is the history of this curious document, and with this brief
introduction I submit it to those who will have the patience and skill
to unravel its manifold difficulties.

_Notes._
Huitzilopochtli was the well-known war-god of the Azteca, whose
functions are described by Sahagun (_Historia_, Lib. I., cap. 1) and
many other writers. The hymn here given is probably the _tlaxotecuyotl_,
which was chanted at the celebration of his feast in the fifteenth month
of the Mexican calendar (see Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. II., cap. 34).
The word means "his glory be established." It was commenced at sunset
and repeated till sunrise.

This hymn may be compared to another, descriptive of the same divinity,
preserved in Sahagun's MS. in Madrid. It is as follows, with my
translation by its side.

When in Florence, in 1889, I had an accurate copy made of the Nahuatl
text and all the figures of the first book of Sahagun's History. The
colored figure of Huitzilopochtli is in accordance with the above
description.

_Notes._
There is no Gloss to this hymn, but its signification seems clear.
_Huitznahuac_ was a name applied to several edifices in the great temple
at Tenochtitlan, as we are informed at length by Sahagun. The word is a
locative from _huitznahua_. This term means "magicians from the south"
or "diviners with thorns," and was applied in the Quetzalcoatl mythical
cyclus to the legendary enemies of Huitzilopochtli, whom he is said to
have destroyed as soon as he was born. (See my discussion of this myth
in _Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society_ for 1887.)
Apparently to perpetuate the memory of this exploit, the custom was, at
the festival of Huitzilopochtli, for the slaves who were to be
sacrificed to form two bands, one representing the Huitznahua and the
other the partisans of the god, and to slaughter each other until the
arrival of the god Paynal put an end to the combat (Sahagun,
_Historia_, Lib. II., cap. 34). The song here given belongs to this
portion of the ancient rite.

_Notes._
The god Tlaloc shared with Huitzilopochtli the highest place in the
Mexican Pantheon. He was the deity who presided over the waters, the
rains, the thunder and the lightning. The annual festival in his honor
took place about the time of corn-planting, and was intended to secure
his favor for this all-important crop. Its details are described at
great length by Diego Duran, _Historia de Nueva Espana_, cap. 86, and
Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. II., cap. 25, and elsewhere. His name is
derived from _tlalli_, earth. _Tlalocan_, referred to in v. 5, "the
place of Tlaloc," was the name of a mountain east of Tenochtitlan, where
the festival of the god was celebrated; but it had also a mythical
meaning, equivalent to "the earthly Paradise," the abode of happy souls.
It will be observed that v. 10 is a repetition of v. 6. The word
_ayauicalo_ refers to the _ayauhcalli_, "house of mist," the home of the
rain god, which Sahagun informs us was represented at the annual
festival by four small buildings near the water's edge, carefully
disposed to face the four cardinal points of the compass (Sahagun, _ubi
supra_).
In v. 8 the expression _tetzauhpilli_ (_tetzauhqui_, to frighten) may
be explained by the figure of Tlaloc, whose statue, says Duran, was that
of _un espantable monstruo, la cara muy fea_ (_ibid._).
The compound in v. 10, _nauhxiuhtica_, "after four years," appears to
refer to the souls of the departed brave ones, who, according to Aztec
mythology, passed to the heaven for four years and after that returned
to the terrestrial Paradise,--the palace of Tlaloc. (See my paper, _The
Journey of the Soul_, in _Proceedings of the Numismatic and Antiquarian
Society of Philadelphia, 1883_.)

_Notes._
The goddess to whom this hymn is devoted was called _Teteoinan_, the
Mother of the Gods, _Toci_, our Mother (maternal ancestor), and also by
another name which signified "the Heart of the Earth," the latter being
bestowed upon her, says Duran, because she was believed to be the cause
of earthquakes. Her general functions were those of a genius of
fertility, extending both to the vegetable and the animal world. Thus,
she was the patroness of the native midwives and of women in childbirth
(Sahagun). Her chief temple at Tepeyacac was one of the most renowned in
ancient Mexico, and it was a felicitous idea of the early missionaries
to have "Our Lady of Guadalupe" make her appearance on the immediate
site of this ancient fane already celebrated as the place of worship of
the older female deity. The _Codex Ramirez_ makes her a daughter of the
first King of Culhuacan.
while the _Codex Telleriano-Remensis_ gives the more intelligible
rendering "there is their home whither they descend," and adds that it
is synonymous with _Xochitlycacan_, "the place where the flowers are
lifted." It was the mystical Paradise of the Aztecs, the Home of the
Gods, and the happy realm of departed souls. The Codex just quoted adds
that the gods were born there, which explains the introduction of the
word into this hymn.

as he became a man truly the earth was shaken, even as he became a man.
_Notes._
The goddess Chimalipan is not mentioned by the authorities at my
command; but from the tenor of the hymn it is evident that the name is
a synonym for the virgin mother of Huitzilopochtli, who is distinctly
referred to by his title _Yautlatoani_ (see _ante_, p. 18). In the myth,
she dwelt upon the Coatepetl, the Serpent Mountain, on the site of
Tulan. For a full discussion of this myth I refer to my inquiry, "_Were
the Toltecs an Historic Nationality?_" in _Proceedings of the Amer.
Phil. Soc._ for Sept. 1887, and _American Hero-Myths_, chap. 11.
(Phila., 1881).
The Gloss distinctly states that the mother of Huitzilopochtli is
referred to in the hymn. We must regard Chimalipan therefore as
identical with _Chimalman_, who, according to another myth dwelt in Tula
as a virgin, and was divinely impregnated by the descending spirit of
the All-father in the shape of a bunch of feathers.
In other myths she is mentioned as also the mother of the Huitznahua,
the enemies and the brothers of Huitzilopochtli, referred to in the
second of this collection of chants.

_Notes._
_Ixcocauhqui_, "the Yellow Faced," was the Mexican God of Fire.
Torquemada gives as his synonyms _Xiuhtecutli_, "Lord of Fire," and
_Huehueteotl_, "the Ancient God" (_Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. VI., cap.
cap. 4). Sahagun describes his annual festival (_Hist._, Lib. II., cap.
_cuezalotl_, flame (_Hist._, Lib. I., cap. 13).
The _tzonmolco_ so often referred to in this hymn was the sixty-fourth
edifice in the great temple of Tenochtitlan, and was devoted to the
worship of Ixcocauhqui (Sahagun). The word literally means "the place of
spreading hairs," the rays or ornaments spreading from the head of the
statue of the god representing flames (Sahagun).
The reference in v. 6 seems to be to one of the women who were
sacrificed at the festival, as related by Sahagun (Lib. II., App.).

_Notes._
"The Chichimecs," says Sahagun (_Hist._, Lib. VI., cap. 7), "worshipped
only one god, called _Mixcoatl_." The _Anales de Cuauhtitlan_ speaks of
Mixcoatl as one of the leaders of the ancient Nahuas from their
primitive home Chicomoztoc, the land of the Seven Caves. This is what is
referred to in the above hymn. In later times Mixcoatl became god of
hunting and of the tornado, and his worship extended to the Otomis.
_Tzihuactitlan_, "the land of the tzihuac bushes," I have not found
mentioned by any of the Spanish authorities, but it is named in
connection with Chicomoztoc in an ancient war-song given in my _Ancient
Nahuatl Poetry_, pp. 88 and 140.
The hymn appears to be in memory of the leadership of Mixcoatl in
conducting the ancestors of the Nahua on their long wanderings after
leaving their pristine seats. It should be read in connection with the
earlier pages of the _Annals of Cuauhtitlan_.
The reduplicated form of the name, _Mimixcoatl_, is not found elsewhere,
and appears to be a poetic license.

_Notes._
_Xochipilli_, "lord of flowers," otherwise named _Macuilxochitl_, "five
flowers" (the name of a small odorous plant), was the deity who gave and
protected all flowering plants. As one of the gods of fertility and
production, he was associated with Tlaloc, god of rains, and Cinteotl,
god of maize. His festival is described in Sahagun (_Historia_, Lib. I.,
cap. 14).

_Notes._
_Xochiquetzal_, "plumage of flowers," was the deity of the artists, the
painters, weavers, engravers on metal, silver and goldsmiths, and of all
who dealt in fine colors. Her figure was that of a young woman with gay
garments and jewelry (Duran, _Historia_, cap. 94). In the _Codex
Telleriano-Remensis_ she is assigned as synonyms _Ichpochtli_, the
Virgin, and _Itzpapalotl_, literally "the obsidian butterfly," but which
was probably applied to a peculiar ornament of her idol.
On _Tamoanchan_ see notes to Hymn IV.
The term _atlayauican_, which I have translated "the dancing place by
the water," appears to refer to the "jar dance," _baile de las jicaras_,
which took place at the festival of the goddess, in the month of
October. Duran informs us this was executed at a spot by the shore of
the lake. Ceremonial bathing was carried on at the same festival, and
these baths were considered to cleanse from sin, as well as from
physical pollution.

_Notes._
The brief Gloss to this Hymn states that it is of ancient Chichimec
origin and that it cannot well be rendered in Nahuatl. Its language is
exceedingly obscure, but it is evidently a dancing song.
_Amimitl_, "the water-arrow," or "fish-spear," was, according to
Torquemada, especially worshipped at Cuitlahuac. He was god of fishing,
and visited the subjects of his displeasure with diseases of a dropsical
or watery character (_Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. VI., cap. 29). On slender
and questionable grounds Clavigero identifies him with Opochtli, the god
of net makers and fishers with nets (_Storia Antica del Messico_, Tom.
II., p. 20).
The four noble ones referred to in vv. 3 and 4 probably refer to those
characters in the Mexican sacred dances called "the four auroras," four
actors clothed respectively in white, green, yellow and red robes. See
Diego Duran, _Historia_, cap. 87.

_Notes._
The absence of a Gloss to this hymn adds to the difficulty of a
translation. _Otontecutli_ was the chief deity of the Otomis, and the
chant appears to be one of their war songs in their conflict with the
Azteca. The name is a compound of _otomitl_, an Otomi, and _tecutli_,
ruler or lord. He is slightly referred to by Sahagun as "the first ruler
to govern the ancestors of the Otomis." (_Historia_, Lib. X, cap. 29,
sec. 5.)

_Notes._
The name of Ayopechcatl does not appear among the divinities named by
Sahagun, Duran or the other authorities at my command. Her name
indicates her function as the goddess of the child-bed and the neonatus,
and the above hymn establishes her claim to a place in the Aztec
pantheon.

_Notes._
Cihuacoatl was the mythical mother of the human race. Her name,
generally translated "serpent woman," should be rendered "woman of
twins" or "bearing twins," as the myth related that such was her
fertility that she always bore two children at one lying-in.
(Torquemada, _Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. VI., cap. 31.) She was also known
by the title _Tonan_ or _Tonantzin_, "our mother," as in v. 5 and 6.
Still another of her appellations was _Quilaztli_, which is given her in
v. 1. (Comp. Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. VI., cap. 27.) She was
essentially a goddess of fertility and reproduction. The name
_cihuacoatl_ was also applied to one of the higher magistrates and war
chiefs in the Aztec army (Sahagun). Reference is made to this in v. 6.
As a goddess of venerable antiquity, she is spoken of as coming from
Colhuacan, "the place of the old men," or of the ancestors of the tribe.
This name is derived from _coloa_, to bend down, as an aged person,
_colli_, an old man. (See my _Ancient Nahuatl Poetry_, pp. 172-3).

_Notes._
In default of a Gloss to this hymn, the indispensable Sahagun again
comes to our aid. He informs us in the Appendix to the second book of
his _Historia_ that "When the Indians celebrated the festival called
_atamalqualiztli_, which took place every eight years, certain natives
called Mazateca swallowed living serpents and frogs, and received
garments as a recompense for their daring." We are not informed as to
the purpose of the festival, and its name, which signifies "eating
bread made with water," is merely that of one of the regular systems of
fasting in vogue in ancient Mexico. (See Sahagun, Lib. III., cap. 8.)
The song before us appears to be a recitation calling on a number of the
Nahua divinities.

_Notes._
There is slight mention of the deity Xipe Totec in the Spanish writers.
He was the patron divinity of the silversmiths, and his festival,
attended with peculiarly bloody rites, was celebrated in the first month
of the calendar. (Duran, _Historia_, cap. 87; Sahagun, Lib. I., cap. 18,
Lib. II., cap. 21, etc.) Totec is named as one of the companions of
Quetzalcoatl, and an ancient divinity whose temple stood on the
_Tzatzitepec_ (see the _Codex Vaticanus_; Tab. XII., in Kingsborough's
_Mexico_). His high priest was called _Youallauan_, "the nocturnal
tippler" (_youalli_, night, and _tlauana_, to drink to slight
intoxication), and it was his duty to tear out the hearts of the human
victims (Sahagun, _u.s._). The epithet _Yoatzin_, "noble night-god,"
bears some relation to the celebration of his rites at night.

_Notes._
The goddess Chicomecoatl, "seven guests," was the deity who presided
over food and drink. Hence in the first verse she is referred to as
Chicomolotl, "seven ears of corn," and is spoken of as a guide to
Tlalocan, or the home of abundance.
Father Duran, who gives a long chapter on this goddess (_Historia_, cap.
also called _Chalciucihuatl_, "Lady of the Emerald," and _Xilonen_,
"goddess of the tender ears of maize." Every kind of seed and vegetable
which served for food was under her guardianship, and hence her festival,
held about the middle of September, was particularly solemn. Her statue
represented her as a girl of about twelve years old.

_Notes._
Tezcatzoncatl was one of the chief gods of the native inebriating
liquor, the pulque. Its effects were recognized as most disastrous, as
is seen from his other names, _Tequechmecaniani_, "he who hangs people,"
and _Teatlahuiani_, "he who drowns people." Sahagun remarks, "They
always regarded the pulque as a bad and dangerous article." The word
_Totochtin_, plural of _tochtli_, rabbit, was applied to drunkards, and
also to some of the deities of special forms of drunkenness.
The first verse is merely a series of lamentations. The second speaks of
the sad effects of the pulque in ancient times. (On Colhuacan see Notes
to Hymn XIII.)

_Atlaua_, mentioned by Olmos, who translates the word "Master of
waters," is a divinity of whom little is known. The derivation from
_atlatl_, arrow, would seem more appropriate to the words of this hymn.
_Chalmecatl_, used as a synonym in v. 1, appears to be from _chalania_,
to beat, to strike, as a drum.

_Notes._
The god Yacatecutli, whose name means "lord of travelers," or "the lord
who guides," was the divinity of the merchants. Sahagun (_Historia_,
Lib. I, cap. 19) and Duran (_Historia_, cap. 90) furnish us many
particulars of his worship.
The hymn is extremely obscure, containing a number of archaic words, and
my rendering is very doubtful. The writer of the Gloss is, I think, also
at fault in his paraphrase. The general purpose of the hymn seems to be
that of a death-song, chanted probably by the victims about to be
sacrificed. They were given the sacred food to eat, as described by
Duran, and then prepared themselves to undergo death, hoping to go to
"the beautiful house," which the Gloss explains as Tlalocan, the
Terrestrial Paradise.
