INTRODUCTION.


THERE could be but one answer to the suggestion of Mr. Coventry Patmore
that his ‚ÄúAngel in the House‚Äù might usefully have a place in this
‚ÄúNational Library.‚Äù  The suggestion was made with the belief that wide
and cheap diffusion would not take from the value of a copyright library
edition, while the best use of writing is fulfilled by the spreading of
verse dedicated to the sacred love of home.  The two parts of the Poem
appeared in 1854 and 1856, were afterwards elaborately revised, and have
since obtained a permanent place among the Home Books of the English
People.  Our readers will join, surely, in thanks to the author for the
present he has made us.

Book I.


THE PROLOGUE.


1


   ‚ÄòMINE is no horse with wings, to gain
      The region of the spheral chime;
   He does but drag a rumbling wain,
      Cheer‚Äôd by the coupled bells of rhyme;
   And if at Fame‚Äôs bewitching note
      My homely Pegasus pricks an ear,
   The world‚Äôs cart-collar hugs his throat,
      And he‚Äôs too wise to prance or rear.‚Äô


2


   Thus ever answer‚Äôd Vaughan his Wife,
      Who, more than he, desired his fame;
   But, in his heart, his thoughts were rife
      How for her sake to earn a name.
   With bays poetic three times crown‚Äôd,
      And other college honours won,
   He, if he chose, might be renown‚Äôd,
      He had but little doubt, she none;
   And in a loftier phrase he talk‚Äôd
      With her, upon their Wedding-Day,
   (The eighth), while through the fields they walk‚Äôd,
      Their children shouting by the way.

   ‚ÄòNot careless of the gift of song,
      Nor out of love with noble fame,
   I, meditating much and long
      What I should sing, how win a name,
   Considering well what theme unsung,
      What reason worth the cost of rhyme,
   Remains to loose the poet‚Äôs tongue
      In these last days, the dregs of time,
   Learn that to me, though born so late,
      There does, beyond desert, befall
   (May my great fortune make me great!)
      The first of themes, sung last of all.
   In green and undiscover‚Äôd ground,
      Yet near where many others sing,
   I have the very well-head found
      Whence gushes the Pierian Spring.‚Äô

   Then she: ‚ÄòWhat is it, Dear?  The Life
      Of Arthur, or Jerusalem‚Äôs Fall?‚Äô
   ‚ÄòNeither: your gentle self, my Wife,
      And love, that grows from one to all.
   And if I faithfully proclaim
      Of these the exceeding worthiness,
   Surely the sweetest wreath of Fame
      Shall, to your hope, my brows caress;
   And if, by virtue of my choice
      Of this, the most heart-touching theme
   That ever tuned a poet‚Äôs voice,
      I live, as I am bold to dream,
   To be delight to many days,
      And into silence only cease
   When those are still, who shared their bays
      With Laura and with Beatrice,
   Imagine, Love, how learned men
      Will deep-conceiv‚Äôd devices find,
   Beyond my purpose and my ken,
      An ancient bard of simple mind.
   You, Sweet, his Mistress, Wife, and Muse,
      Were you for mortal woman meant?
   Your praises give a hundred clues
      To mythological intent!
   And, severing thus the truth from trope,
      In you the Commentators see
   Outlines occult of abstract scope,
      A future for philosophy!
   Your arm‚Äôs on mine! these are the meads
      In which we pass our living days;
   There Avon runs, now hid with reeds,
      Now brightly brimming pebbly bays;
   Those are our children‚Äôs songs that come
      With bells and bleatings of the sheep;
   And there, in yonder English home,
      We thrive on mortal food and sleep!‚Äô
   She laugh‚Äôd.  How proud she always was
      To feel how proud he was of her!
   But he had grown distraught, because
      The Muse‚Äôs mood began to stir.

   His purpose with performance crown‚Äôd,
      He to his well-pleased Wife rehears‚Äôd,

PRELUDES.

I.
_The Impossibility_.


   Lo, love‚Äôs obey‚Äôd by all.  ‚ÄôTis right
      That all should know what they obey,
   Lest erring conscience damp delight,
      And folly laugh our joys away.
   Thou Primal Love, who grantest wings
      And voices to the woodland birds,
   Grant me the power of saying things
      Too simple and too sweet for words!


II.
_Love‚Äôs Really_.


   I walk, I trust, with open eyes;
      I‚Äôve travell‚Äôd half my worldly course;
   And in the way behind me lies
      Much vanity and some remorse;
   I‚Äôve lived to feel how pride may part
      Spirits, tho‚Äô match‚Äôd like hand and glove;
   I‚Äôve blush‚Äôd for love‚Äôs abode, the heart;
      But have not disbelieved in love;
   Nor unto love, sole mortal thing
      Of worth immortal, done the wrong
   To count it, with the rest that sing,
      Unworthy of a serious song;
   And love is my reward; for now,
      When most of dead‚Äôning time complain,
   The myrtle blooms upon my brow,
      Its odour quickens all my brain.


III.
_The Poet‚Äôs Confidence_.


   The richest realm of all the earth
      Is counted still a heathen land:
   Lo, I, like Joshua, now go forth
      To give it into Israel‚Äôs hand.
   I will not hearken blame or praise;
      For so should I dishonour do
   To that sweet Power by which these Lays
      Alone are lovely, good, and true;
   Nor credence to the world‚Äôs cries give,
      Which ever preach and still prevent
   Pure passion‚Äôs high prerogative
      To make, not follow, precedent.
   From love‚Äôs abysmal ether rare
      If I to men have here made known
   New truths, they, like new stars, were there
      Before, though not yet written down.
   Moving but as the feelings move,
      I run, or loiter with delight,
   Or pause to mark where gentle Love
      Persuades the soul from height to height.
   Yet, know ye, though my words are gay
      As David‚Äôs dance, which Michal scorn‚Äôd.
   If kindly you receive the Lay,
      You shall be sweetly help‚Äôd and warn‚Äôd.


THE CATHEDRAL CLOSE.

1


   Once more I came to Sarum Close,
      With joy half memory, half desire,
   And breathed the sunny wind that rose
      And blew the shadows o‚Äôer the Spire,
   And toss‚Äôd the lilac‚Äôs scented plumes,
      And sway‚Äôd the chestnut‚Äôs thousand cones,
   And fill‚Äôd my nostrils with perfumes,
      And shaped the clouds in waifs and zones,
   And wafted down the serious strain
      Of Sarum bells, when, true to time,
   I reach‚Äôd the Dean‚Äôs, with heart and brain
      That trembled to the trembling chime.


2


   ‚ÄôTwas half my home, six years ago.
      The six years had not alter‚Äôd it:
   Red-brick and ashlar, long and low,
      With dormers and with oriels lit.
   Geranium, lychnis, rose array‚Äôd
      The windows, all wide open thrown;
   And some one in the Study play‚Äôd
      The Wedding-March of Mendelssohn.
   And there it was I last took leave:
      ‚ÄôTwas Christmas: I remember‚Äôd now
   The cruel girls, who feign‚Äôd to grieve,
      Took down the evergreens; and how
   The holly into blazes woke
      The fire, lighting the large, low room,
   A dim, rich lustre of old oak
      And crimson velvet‚Äôs glowing gloom.
   No change had touch‚Äôd Dean Churchill: kind,
      By widowhood more than winters bent,
   And settled in a cheerful mind,
      As still forecasting heaven‚Äôs content.
   Well might his thoughts be fix‚Äôd on high,
      Now she was there!  Within her face
   Humility and dignity
      Were met in a most sweet embrace.
   She seem‚Äôd expressly sent below
      To teach our erring minds to see
   The rhythmic change of time‚Äôs swift flow
      As part of still eternity.
   Her life, all honour, observed, with awe
      Which cross experience could not mar,
   The fiction of the Christian law
      That all men honourable are;
   And so her smile at once conferr‚Äôd
      High flattery and benign reproof;
   And I, a rude boy, strangely stirr‚Äôd,
      Grew courtly in my own behoof.
   The years, so far from doing her wrong,
      Anointed her with gracious balm,
   And made her brows more and more young
      With wreaths of amaranth and palm.


4


   Was this her eldest, Honor; prude,
      Who would not let me pull the swing;
   Who, kiss‚Äôd at Christmas, call‚Äôd me rude,
      And, sobbing low, refused to sing?
   How changed!  In shape no slender Grace,
      But Venus; milder than the dove;
   Her mother‚Äôs air; her Norman face;
      Her large sweet eyes, clear lakes of love.
   Mary I knew.  In former time
      Ailing and pale, she thought that bliss
   Was only for a better clime,
      And, heavenly overmuch, scorn‚Äôd this.
   I, rash with theories of the right,
      Which stretch‚Äôd the tether of my Creed,
   But did not break it, held delight
      Half discipline.  We disagreed.
   She told the Dean I wanted grace.
      Now she was kindest of the three,
   And soft wild roses deck‚Äôd her face.
      And, what, was this my Mildred, she
   To herself and all a sweet surprise?
      My Pet, who romp‚Äôd and roll‚Äôd a hoop?
   I wonder‚Äôd where those daisy eyes
      Had found their touching curve and droop.


5


   Unmannerly times!  But now we sat
      Stranger than strangers; till I caught
   And answer‚Äôd Mildred‚Äôs smile; and that
      Spread to the rest, and freedom brought.
   The Dean talk‚Äôd little, looking on,
      Of three such daughters justly vain.
   What letters they had had from Bonn,
      Said Mildred, and what plums from Spain!
   By Honor I was kindly task‚Äôd
      To excuse my never coming down
   From Cambridge; Mary smiled and ask‚Äôd
      Were Kant and Goethe yet outgrown?
   And, pleased, we talk‚Äôd the old days o‚Äôer;
      And, parting, I for pleasure sigh‚Äôd.
   To be there as a friend, (since more),
      Seem‚Äôd then, seems still, excuse for pride;
   For something that abode endued
      With temple-like repose, an air
   Of life‚Äôs kind purposes pursued
      With order‚Äôd freedom sweet and fair.
   A tent pitch‚Äôd in a world not right
      It seem‚Äôd, whose inmates, every one,
   On tranquil faces bore the light
      Of duties beautifully done,
   And humbly, though they had few peers,
      Kept their own laws, which seem‚Äôd to be
   The fair sum of six thousand years‚Äô
      Traditions of civility.

PRELUDES.

I.
_The Paragon_.


   WHEN I behold the skies aloft
      Passing the pageantry of dreams,
   The cloud whose bosom, cygnet-soft,
      A couch for nuptial Juno seems,
   The ocean broad, the mountains bright,
      The shadowy vales with feeding herds,
   I from my lyre the music smite,
      Nor want for justly matching words.
   All forces of the sea and air,
      All interests of hill and plain,
   I so can sing, in seasons fair,
      That who hath felt may feel again.
   Elated oft by such free songs,
      I think with utterance free to raise
   That hymn for which the whole world longs,
      A worthy hymn in woman‚Äôs praise;
   A hymn bright-noted like a bird‚Äôs,
      Arousing these song-sleepy times
   With rhapsodies of perfect words,
      Ruled by returning kiss of rhymes.
   But when I look on her and hope
      To tell with joy what I admire,
   My thoughts lie cramp‚Äôd in narrow scope,
      Or in the feeble birth expire;
   No mystery of well-woven speech,
      No simplest phrase of tenderest fall,
   No liken‚Äôd excellence can reach
      Her, thee most excellent of all,
   The best half of creation‚Äôs best,
      Its heart to feel, its eye to see,
   The crown and complex of the rest,
      Its aim and its epitome.
   Nay, might I utter my conceit,
      ‚ÄôTwere after all a vulgar song,
   For she‚Äôs so simply, subtly sweet,
      My deepest rapture does her wrong.
   Yet is it now my chosen task
      To sing her worth as Maid and Wife;
   Nor happier post than this I ask,
      To live her laureate all my life.
   On wings of love uplifted free,
      And by her gentleness made great,
   I‚Äôll teach how noble man should be
      To match with such a lovely mate;
   And then in her may move the more
      The woman‚Äôs wish to be desired,
   (By praise increased), till both shall soar,
      With blissful emulations fired.
   And, as geranium, pink, or rose
      Is thrice itself through power of art,
   So may my happy skill disclose
      New fairness even in her fair heart;
   Until that churl shall nowhere be
      Who bends not, awed, before the throne
   Of her affecting majesty,
      So meek, so far unlike our own;
   Until (for who may hope too much
      From her who wields the powers of love?)
   Our lifted lives at last shall touch
      That happy goal to which they move;
   Until we find, as darkness rolls
      Away, and evil mists dissolve,
   That nuptial contrasts are the poles
      On which the heavenly spheres revolve.


II.
_Love at Large_.


   Whene‚Äôer I come where ladies are,
      How sad soever I was before,
   Though like a ship frost-bound and far
      Withheld in ice from the ocean‚Äôs roar,
   Third-winter‚Äôd in that dreadful dock,
      With stiffen‚Äôd cordage, sails decay‚Äôd,
   And crew that care for calm and shock
      Alike, too dull to be dismay‚Äôd,
   Yet, if I come where ladies are,
      How sad soever I was before,
   Then is my sadness banish‚Äôd far,
      And I am like that ship no more;
   Or like that ship if the ice-field splits,
      Burst by the sudden polar Spring,
   And all thank God with their warming wits,
      And kiss each other and dance and sing,
   And hoist fresh sails, that make the breeze
      Blow them along the liquid sea,
   Out of the North, where life did freeze,
      Into the haven where they would be.


III.
_Love and Duty_.


   Anne lived so truly from above,
      She was so gentle and so good,
   That duty bade me fall in love,
      And ‚Äòbut for that,‚Äô thought I, ‚ÄòI should!‚Äô
   I worshipp‚Äôd Kate with all my will,
      In idle moods you seem to see
   A noble spirit in a hill,
      A human touch about a tree.


IV.
_A Distinction_.


   The lack of lovely pride, in her
      Who strives to please, my pleasure numbs,
   And still the maid I most prefer
      Whose care to please with pleasing comes.


MARY AND MILDRED.

1


   One morning, after Church, I walk‚Äôd
      Alone with Mary on the lawn,
   And felt myself, howe‚Äôer we talk‚Äôd,
      To grave themes delicately drawn.
   When she, delighted, found I knew
      More of her peace than she supposed,
   Our confidences heavenwards grew,
      Like fox-glove buds, in pairs disclosed.
   Our former faults did we confess,
      Our ancient feud was more than heal‚Äôd,
   And, with the woman‚Äôs eagerness
      For amity full-sign‚Äôd and seal‚Äôd,
   She, offering up for sacrifice
      Her heart‚Äôs reserve, brought out to show
   Some verses, made when she was ice
      To all but Heaven, six years ago;
   Since happier grown!  I took and read
      The neat-writ lines.  She, void of guile,
   Too late repenting, blush‚Äôd, and said,
      I must not think about the style.


2


   ‚ÄòDay after day, until to-day,
      Imaged the others gone before,
   The same dull task, the weary way,
      The weakness pardon‚Äôd o‚Äôer and o‚Äôer,

   ‚ÄòThe thwarted thirst, too faintly felt,
      For joy‚Äôs well-nigh forgotten life,
   The restless heart, which, when I knelt,
      Made of my worship barren strife.

   ‚ÄòAh, whence to-day‚Äôs so sweet release,
      This clearance light of all my care,
   This conscience free, this fertile peace,
      These softly folded wings of prayer,

   ‚ÄòThis calm and more than conquering love,
      With which nought evil dares to cope,
   This joy that lifts no glance above,
      For faith too sure, too sweet for hope?

   ‚ÄòO, happy time, too happy change,
      It will not live, though fondly nurst!
   Full soon the sun will seem as strange
      As now the cloud which seems dispersed.‚Äô


3


   She from a rose-tree shook the blight;
      And well she knew that I knew well
   Her grace with silence to requite;
      And, answering now the luncheon bell,
   I laugh‚Äôd at Mildred‚Äôs laugh, which made
      All melancholy wrong, its mood
   Such sweet self-confidence display‚Äôd,
      So glad a sense of present good.


4


   I laugh‚Äôd and sigh‚Äôd: for I confess
      I never went to Ball, or F√™te,
   Or Show, but in pursuit express
      Of my predestinated mate;
   And thus to me, who had in sight
      The happy chance upon the cards,
   Each beauty blossom‚Äôd in the light
      Of tender personal regards;
   And, in the records of my breast,
      Red-letter‚Äôd, eminently fair,
   Stood sixteen, who, beyond the rest,
      By turns till then had been my care:
   At Berlin three, one at St. Cloud,
      At Chatteris, near Cambridge, one,
   At Ely four, in London two,
      Two at Bowness, in Paris none,
   And, last and best, in Sarum three;
      But dearest of the whole fair troop,
   In judgment of the moment, she
      Whose daisy eyes had learn‚Äôd to droop.
   Her very faults my fancy fired;
      My loving will, so thwarted, grew;
   And, bent on worship, I admired
      Whate‚Äôer she was, with partial view.
   And yet when, as to-day, her smile
      Was prettiest, I could not but note
   Honoria, less admired the while,
      Was lovelier, though from love remote.



CANTO III.
Honoria


PRELUDES.

I.
_The Lover_.


   HE meets, by heavenly chance express,
      The destined maid; some hidden hand
   Unveils to him that loveliness
      Which others cannot understand.
   His merits in her presence grow,
      To match the promise in her eyes,
   And round her happy footsteps blow
      The authentic airs of Paradise.
   For joy of her he cannot sleep;
      Her beauty haunts him all the night;
   It melts his heart, it makes him weep
      For wonder, worship, and delight.
   O, paradox of love, he longs,
      Most humble when he most aspires,
   To suffer scorn and cruel wrongs
      From her he honours and desires.
   Her graces make him rich, and ask
      No guerdon; this imperial style
   Affronts him; he disdains to bask,
      The pensioner of her priceless smile.
   He prays for some hard thing to do,
      Some work of fame and labour immense,
   To stretch the languid bulk and thew
      Of love‚Äôs fresh-born magnipotence.
   No smallest boon were bought too dear,
      Though barter‚Äôd for his love-sick life;
   Yet trusts he, with undaunted cheer,
      To vanquish heaven, and call her Wife
   He notes how queens of sweetness still
      Neglect their crowns, and stoop to mate;
   How, self-consign‚Äôd with lavish will,
      They ask but love proportionate;
   How swift pursuit by small degrees,
      Love‚Äôs tactic, works like miracle;
   How valour, clothed in courtesies,
      Brings down the haughtiest citadel;
   And therefore, though he merits not
      To kiss the braid upon her skirt,
   His hope, discouraged ne‚Äôer a jot,
      Out-soars all possible desert.


II.
_Love a Virtue_.


   Strong passions mean weak will, and he
      Who truly knows the strength and bliss
   Which are in love, will own with me
      No passion but a virtue ‚Äôtis.
   Few hear my word; it soars above
      The subtlest senses of the swarm
   Of wretched things which know not love,
      Their Psyche still a wingless worm.
   Ice-cold seems heaven‚Äôs noble glow
      To spirits whose vital heat is hell;
   And to corrupt hearts even so
      The songs I sing, the tale I tell.
   These cannot see the robes of white
      In which I sing of love.  Alack,
   But darkness shows in heavenly light,
      Though whiteness, in the dark, is black!


III.
_The Attainment_.


   You love?  That‚Äôs high as you shall go;
      For ‚Äôtis as true as Gospel text,
   Not noble then is never so,
      Either in this world or the next.


HONORIA.

1


   Grown weary with a week‚Äôs exile
      From those fair friends, I rode to see
   The church-restorings; lounged awhile,
      And met the Dean; was ask‚Äôd to tea,
   And found their cousin, Frederick Graham
      At Honor‚Äôs side.  Was I concern‚Äôd,
   If, when she sang, his colour came,
      That mine, as with a buffet, burn‚Äôd?
   A man to please a girl! thought I,
      Retorting his forced smiles, the shrouds
   Of wrath, so hid as she was by,
      Sweet moon between her lighted clouds!


2


   Whether this Cousin was the cause
      I know not, but I seem‚Äôd to see,
   The first time then, how fair she was,
      How much the fairest of the three.
   Each stopp‚Äôd to let the other go;
      But, time-bound, he arose the first.
   Stay‚Äôd he in Sarum long?  If so
      I hoped to see him at the Hurst.
   No: he had call‚Äôd here, on his way
      To Portsmouth, where the Arrogant,
   His ship, was; he should leave next day,
      For two years‚Äô cruise in the Levant.


3


   Had love in her yet struck its germs?
      I watch‚Äôd.  Her farewell show‚Äôd me plain
   She loved, on the majestic terms
      That she should not be loved again;
   And so her cousin, parting, felt.
      Hope in his voice and eye was dead.
   Compassion did my malice melt;
      Then went I home to a restless bed.
   I, who admired her too, could see
      His infinite remorse at this
   Great mystery, that she should be
      So beautiful, yet not be his,
   And, pitying, long‚Äôd to plead his part;
      But scarce could tell, so strange my whim,
   Whether the weight upon my heart
      Was sorrow for myself or him.


4


   She was all mildness; yet ‚Äôtwas writ
      In all her grace, most legibly,
   ‚ÄòHe that‚Äôs for heaven itself unfit,
      Let him not hope to merit me.‚Äô
   And such a challenge, quite apart
      From thoughts of love, humbled, and thus
   To sweet repentance moved my heart,
      And made me more magnanimous,
   And led me to review my life,
      Inquiring where in aught the least,
   If question were of her for wife,
      Ill might be mended, hope increas‚Äôd.
   Not that I soar‚Äôd so far above
      Myself, as this great hope to dare;
   And yet I well foresaw that love
      Might hope where reason must despair;
   And, half-resenting the sweet pride
      Which would not ask me to admire,
   ‚ÄòOh,‚Äô to my secret heart I sigh‚Äôd,
      ‚ÄòThat I were worthy to desire!‚Äô


5


   As drowsiness my brain reliev‚Äôd,
      A shrill defiance of all to arms,
   Shriek‚Äôd by the stable-cock, receiv‚Äôd
      An angry answer from three farms.
   And, then, I dream‚Äôd that I, her knight,
      A clarion‚Äôs haughty pathos heard,
   And rode securely to the fight,
      Cased in the scarf she had conferr‚Äôd;
   And there, the bristling lists behind,
      Saw many, and vanquish‚Äôd all I saw
   Of her unnumber‚Äôd cousin-kind,
      In Navy, Army, Church, and Law;
   Smitten, the warriors somehow turn‚Äôd
      To Sarum choristers, whose song,
   Mix‚Äôd with celestial sorrow, yearn‚Äôd
      With joy no memory can prolong;
   And phantasms as absurd and sweet
      Merged each in each in endless chace,
   And everywhere I seem‚Äôd to meet
      The haunting fairness of her face.

PRELUDES.

I.
_The Rose of the World_.


   LO, when the Lord made North and South
      And sun and moon ordained, He,
   Forthbringing each by word of mouth
      In order of its dignity,
   Did man from the crude clay express
      By sequence, and, all else decreed,
   He form‚Äôd the woman; nor might less
      Than Sabbath such a work succeed.
   And still with favour singled out,
      Marr‚Äôd less than man by mortal fall,
   Her disposition is devout,
      Her countenance angelical;
   The best things that the best believe
      Are in her face so kindly writ
   The faithless, seeing her, conceive
      Not only heaven, but hope of it;
   No idle thought her instinct shrouds,
      But fancy chequers settled sense,
   Like alteration of the clouds
      On noonday‚Äôs azure permanence;
   Pure dignity, composure, ease
      Declare affections nobly fix‚Äôd,
   And impulse sprung from due degrees
      Of sense and spirit sweetly mix‚Äôd.
   Her modesty, her chiefest grace,
      The cestus clasping Venus‚Äô side,
   How potent to deject the face
      Of him who would affront its pride!
   Wrong dares not in her presence speak,
      Nor spotted thought its taint disclose
   Under the protest of a cheek
      Outbragging Nature‚Äôs boast the rose.
   In mind and manners how discreet;
      How artless in her very art;
   How candid in discourse; how sweet
      The concord of her lips and heart;
   How simple and how circumspect;
      How subtle and how fancy-free;
   Though sacred to her love, how deck‚Äôd
      With unexclusive courtesy;
   How quick in talk to see from far
      The way to vanquish or evade;
   How able her persuasions are
      To prove, her reasons to persuade;
   How (not to call true instinct‚Äôs bent
      And woman‚Äôs very nature, harm),
   How amiable and innocent
      Her pleasure in her power to charm;
   How humbly careful to attract,
      Though crown‚Äôd with all the soul desires,
   Connubial aptitude exact,
      Diversity that never tires.


II.
_The Tribute_.


   Boon Nature to the woman bows;
      She walks in earth‚Äôs whole glory clad,
   And, chiefest far herself of shows,
      All others help her, and are glad:
   No splendour ‚Äôneath the sky‚Äôs proud dome
      But serves for her familiar wear;
   The far-fetch‚Äôd diamond finds its home
      Flashing and smouldering in her hair;
   For her the seas their pearls reveal;
      Art and strange lands her pomp supply
   With purple, chrome, and cochineal,
      Ochre, and lapis lazuli;
   The worm its golden woof presents;
      Whatever runs, flies, dives, or delves,
   All doff for her their ornaments,
      Which suit her better than themselves;
   And all, by this their power to give,
      Proving her right to take, proclaim
   Her beauty‚Äôs clear prerogative
      To profit so by Eden‚Äôs blame.


III.
_Compensation_.


   That nothing here may want its praise,
      Know, she who in her dress reveals
   A fine and modest taste, displays
      More loveliness than she conceals.


THE MORNING CALL.

1


   ‚ÄòBy meekness charm‚Äôd, or proud to allow
      A queenly claim to live admired,
   Full many a lady has ere now
      My apprehensive fancy fired,
   And woven many a transient chain;
      But never lady like to this,
   Who holds me as the weather-vane
      Is held by yonder clematis.
   She seems the life of nature‚Äôs powers;
      Her beauty is the genial thought
   Which makes the sunshine bright; the flowers,
      But for their hint of her, were nought.‚Äô


2


   A voice, the sweeter for the grace
      Of suddenness, while thus I dream‚Äôd,
   ‚ÄòGood morning!‚Äô said or sang.  Her face
      The mirror of the morning seem‚Äôd.
   Her sisters in the garden walk‚Äôd,
      And would I come?  Across the Hall
   She led me; and we laugh‚Äôd and talk‚Äôd,
      And praised the Flower-show and the Ball;
   And Mildred‚Äôs pinks had gain‚Äôd the Prize;
      And, stepping like the light-foot fawn,
   She brought me ‚ÄòWiltshire Butterflies,‚Äô
      The Prize-book; then we paced the lawn,
   Close-cut, and with geranium-plots,
      A rival glow of green and red;
   Than counted sixty apricots
      On one small tree; the gold-fish fed;
   And watch‚Äôd where, black with scarlet tans,
      Proud Psyche stood and flash‚Äôd like flame,
   Showing and shutting splendid fans;
      And in the prize we found its name.


3


   The sweet hour lapsed, and left my breast
      A load of joy and tender care;
   And this delight, which life oppress‚Äôd,
      To fix‚Äôd aims grew, that ask‚Äôd for pray‚Äôr.
   I rode home slowly; whip-in-hand
      And soil‚Äôd bank-notes all ready, stood
   The Farmer who farm‚Äôd all my land,
      Except the little Park and Wood;
   And with the accustom‚Äôd compliment
      Of talk, and beef, and frothing beer,
   I, my own steward, took my rent,
      Three hundred pounds for half the year;
   Our witnesses the Cook and Groom,
      We sign‚Äôd the lease for seven years more,
   And bade Good-day; then to my room
      I went, and closed and lock‚Äôd the door,
   And cast myself down on my bed,
      And there, with many a blissful tear,
   I vow‚Äôd to love and pray‚Äôd to wed
      The maiden who had grown so dear;
   Thank‚Äôd God who had set her in my path;
      And promised, as I hoped to win,
   That I would never dim my faith
      By the least selfishness or sin;
   Whatever in her sight I‚Äôd seem
      I‚Äôd truly be; I‚Äôd never blend
   With my delight in her a dream
      ‚ÄôTwould change her cheek to comprehend;
   And, if she wish‚Äôd it, I‚Äôd prefer
      Another‚Äôs to my own success;
   And always seek the best for her
      With unofficious tenderness.


4


   Rising, I breathed a brighter clime,
      And found myself all self above,
   And, with a charity sublime,
      Contemn‚Äôd not those who did not love:
   And I could not but feel that then
      I shone with something of her grace,
   And went forth to my fellow men
      My commendation in my face.

_The Comparison_.


   WHERE she succeeds with cloudless brow,
      In common and in holy course,
   He fails, in spite of prayer and vow
      And agonies of faith and force;
   Or, if his suit with Heaven prevails
      To righteous life, his virtuous deeds
   Lack beauty, virtue‚Äôs badge; she fails
      More graciously than he succeeds.
   Her spirit, compact of gentleness,
      If Heaven postpones or grants her pray‚Äôr,
   Conceives no pride in its success,
      And in its failure no despair;
   But his, enamour‚Äôd of its hurt,
      Baffled, blasphemes, or, not denied,
   Crows from the dunghill of desert,
      And wags its ugly wings for pride.
   He‚Äôs never young nor ripe; she grows
      More infantine, auroral, mild,
   And still the more she lives and knows
      The lovelier she‚Äôs express‚Äôd a child.
   Say that she wants the will of man
      To conquer fame, not check‚Äôd by cross,
   Nor moved when others bless or ban;
      She wants but what to have were loss.
   Or say she wants the patient brain
      To track shy truth; her facile wit
   At that which he hunts down with pain
      Flies straight, and does exactly hit.
   Were she but half of what she is,
      He twice himself, mere love alone,
   Her special crown, as truth is his,
      Gives title to the worthier throne;
   For love is substance, truth the form;
      Truth without love were less than nought;
   But blindest love is sweet and warm,
      And full of truth not shaped by thought,
   And therefore in herself she stands
      Adorn‚Äôd with undeficient grace,
   Her happy virtues taking hands,
      Each smiling in another‚Äôs face.
   So, dancing round the Tree of Life,
      They make an Eden in her breast,
   While his, disjointed and at strife,
      Proud-thoughted, do not bring him rest.


II.
_Love in Tears_.


   If fate Love‚Äôs dear ambition mar,
      And load his breast with hopeless pain,
   And seem to blot out sun and star,
      Love, won or lost, is countless gain;
   His sorrow boasts a secret bliss
      Which sorrow of itself beguiles,
   And Love in tears too noble is
      For pity, save of Love in smiles.
   But, looking backward through his tears,
      With vision of maturer scope,
   How often one dead joy appears
      The platform of some better hope!
   And, let us own, the sharpest smart
      Which human patience may endure
   Pays light for that which leaves the heart
      More generous, dignified, and pure.


III.
_Prospective Faith_.


   They safely walk in darkest ways
      Whose youth is lighted from above,
   Where, through the senses‚Äô silvery haze,
      Dawns the veil‚Äôd moon of nuptial love.
   Who is the happy husband?  He
      Who, scanning his unwedded life,
   Thanks Heaven, with a conscience free,
      ‚ÄôTwas faithful to his future wife.


IV.
_Venus Victrix_.


   Fatal in force, yet gentle in will,
      Defeats, from her, are tender pacts,
   For, like the kindly lodestone, still
      She‚Äôs drawn herself by what she attracts.


THE VIOLETS.

1


   I went not to the Dean‚Äôs unbid:
      I would not have my mystery,
   From her so delicately hid,
      The guess of gossips at their tea.
   A long, long week, and not once there,
      Had made my spirit sick and faint,
   And lack-love, foul as love is fair,
      Perverted all things to complaint.
   How vain the world had grown to be!
      How mean all people and their ways,
   How ignorant their sympathy,
      And how impertinent their praise;
   What they for virtuousness esteem‚Äôd,
      How far removed from heavenly right;
   What pettiness their trouble seem‚Äôd,
      How undelightful their delight;
   To my necessity how strange
      The sunshine and the song of birds;
   How dull the clouds‚Äô continual change,
      How foolishly content the herds;
   How unaccountable the law
      Which bade me sit in blindness here,
   While she, the sun by which I saw,
      Shed splendour in an idle sphere!
   And then I kiss‚Äôd her stolen glove,
      And sigh‚Äôd to reckon and define
   The modes of martyrdom in love,
      And how far each one might be mine.
   I thought how love, whose vast estate
      Is earth and air and sun and sea,
   Encounters oft the beggar‚Äôs fate,
      Despised on score of poverty;
   How Heaven, inscrutable in this,
      Lets the gross general make or mar
   The destiny of love, which is
      So tender and particular;
   How nature, as unnatural
      And contradicting nature‚Äôs source,
   Which is but love, seems most of all
      Well-pleased to harry true love‚Äôs course;
   How, many times, it comes to pass
      That trifling shades of temperament,
   Affecting only one, alas,
      Not love, but love‚Äôs success prevent;
   How manners often falsely paint
      The man; how passionate respect,
   Hid by itself, may bear the taint
      Of coldness and a dull neglect;
   And how a little outward dust
      Can a clear merit quite o‚Äôercloud,
   And make her fatally unjust,
      And him desire a darker shroud;
   How senseless opportunity
      Gives baser men the better chance;
   How powers, adverse else, agree
      To cheat her in her ignorance;
   How Heaven its very self conspires
      With man and nature against love,
   As pleased to couple cross desires,
      And cross where they themselves approve.
   Wretched were life, if the end were now!
      But this gives tears to dry despair,
   Faith shall be blest, we know not how,
      And love fulfill‚Äôd, we know not where.


2


   While thus I grieved, and kiss‚Äôd her glove,
      My man brought in her note to say,
   Papa had hid her send his love,
      And would I dine with them next day?
   They had learn‚Äôd and practised Purcell‚Äôs glee,
      To sing it by to-morrow night.
   The Postscript was: Her sisters and she
      Inclosed some violets, blue and white;
   She and her sisters found them where
      I wager‚Äôd once no violets grew;
   So they had won the gloves.  And there
      The violets lay, two white, one blue.



CANTO VI.

PRELUDES.

I.
_Perfect Love rare_.


   MOST rare is still most noble found,
      Most noble still most incomplete;
   Sad law, which leaves King Love uncrown‚Äôd
      In this obscure, terrestrial seat!
   With bale more sweet than others‚Äô bliss,
      And bliss more wise than others‚Äô bale,
   The secrets of the world are his.
      And freedom without let or pale.
   O, zealous good, O, virtuous glee,
      Religious, and without alloy,
   O, privilege high, which none but he
      Who highly merits can enjoy;
   O, Love, who art that fabled sun
      Which all the world with bounty loads,
   Without respect of realms, save one,
      And gilds with double lustre Rhodes;
   A day of whose delicious life,
      Though full of terrors, full of tears,
   Is better than of other life
      A hundred thousand million years;
   Thy heavenly splendour magnifies
      The least commixture of earth‚Äôs mould,
   Cheapens thyself in thine own eyes,
      And makes the foolish mocker bold.


II.
_Love Justified_.


   What if my pole-star of respect
      Be dim to others?  Shall their ‚ÄòNay,‚Äô
   Presumably their own defect,
      Invalidate my heart‚Äôs strong ‚ÄòYea‚Äô?
   And can they rightly me condemn,
      If I, with partial love, prefer?
   I am not more unjust to them,
      But only not unjust to her.
   Leave us alone!  After awhile,
      This pool of private charity
   Shall make its continent an isle,
      And roll, a world-embracing sea;
   This foolish zeal of lip for lip,
      This fond, self-sanction‚Äôd, wilful zest,
   Is that elect relationship
      Which forms and sanctions all the rest;
   This little germ of nuptial love,
      Which springs so simply from the sod,
   The root is, as my song shall prove,
      Of all our love to man and God.


III.
_Love Serviceable_.


   What measure Fate to him shall mete
      Is not the noble Lover‚Äôs care;
   He‚Äôs heart-sick with a longing sweet
      To make her happy as she‚Äôs fair.
   Oh, misery, should she him refuse,
      And so her dearest good mistake!
   His own success he thus pursues
      With frantic zeal for her sole sake.
   To lose her were his life to blight,
      Being loss to hers; to make her his,
   Except as helping her delight,
      He calls but incidental bliss;
   And holding life as so much pelf
      To buy her posies, learns this lore:
   He does not rightly love himself
      Who does not love another more.


IV.
_A Riddle Solved_.


   Kind souls, you wonder why, love you,
      When you, you wonder why, love none.
   We love, Fool, for the good we do,
      Not that which unto us is done!


THE DEAN.

1


   The Ladies rose.  I held the door,
      And sigh‚Äôd, as her departing grace
   Assured me that she always wore
      A heart as happy as her face;
   And, jealous of the winds that blew,
      I dreaded, o‚Äôer the tasteless wine,
   What fortune momently might do
      To hurt the hope that she‚Äôd be mine.


2


   Towards my mark the Dean‚Äôs talk set:
      He praised my ‚ÄòNotes on Abury,‚Äô
   Read when the Association met
      At Sarum; he was pleased to see
   I had not stopp‚Äôd, as some men had,
      At Wrangler and Prize Poet; last,
   He hoped the business was not bad
      I came about: then the wine pass‚Äôd.


3


   A full glass prefaced my reply:
      I loved his daughter, Honor; I told
   My estate and prospects; might I try
      To win her?  At my words so bold
   My sick heart sank.  Then he: He gave
      His glad consent, if I could get
   Her love.  A dear, good Girl! she‚Äôd have
      Only three thousand pounds as yet;
   More bye and bye.  Yes, his good will
      Should go with me; he would not stir;
   He and my father in old time still
      Wish‚Äôd I should one day marry her;
   But God so seldom lets us take
      Our chosen pathway, when it lies
   In steps that either mar or make
      Or alter others‚Äô destinies,
   That, though his blessing and his pray‚Äôr
      Had help‚Äôd, should help, my suit, yet he
   Left all to me, his passive share
      Consent and opportunity.
   My chance, he hoped, was good: I‚Äôd won
      Some name already; friends and place
   Appear‚Äôd within my reach, but none
      Her mind and manners would not grace.
   Girls love to see the men in whom
      They invest their vanities admired;
   Besides, where goodness is, there room
      For good to work will be desired.
   ‚ÄôTwas so with one now pass‚Äôd away;
      And what she was at twenty-two,
   Honor was now; and he might say
      Mine was a choice I could not rue.


4


   He ceased, and gave his hand.  He had won
      (And all my heart was in my word),
   From me the affection of a son,
      Whichever fortune Heaven conferr‚Äôd!
   Well, well, would I take more wine?  Then go
      To her; she makes tea on the lawn
   These fine warm afternoons.  And so
      We went whither my soul was drawn;
   And her light-hearted ignorance
      Of interest in our discourse
   Fill‚Äôd me with love, and seem‚Äôd to enhance
      Her beauty with pathetic force,
   As, through the flowery mazes sweet,
      Fronting the wind that flutter‚Äôd blythe,
   And loved her shape, and kiss‚Äôd her feet,
      Shown to their insteps proud and lithe,
   She approach‚Äôd, all mildness and young trust,
      And ever her chaste and noble air
   Gave to love‚Äôs feast its choicest gust,
      A vague, faint augury of despair.

PRELUDES.

I.
_Love‚Äôs Immortality_.


   How vilely ‚Äôtwere to misdeserve
      The poet‚Äôs gift of perfect speech,
   In song to try, with trembling nerve,
      The limit of its utmost reach,
   Only to sound the wretched praise
      Of what to-morrow shall not be;
   So mocking with immortal bays
      The cross-bones of mortality!
   I do not thus.  My faith is fast
      That all the loveliness I sing
   Is made to bear the mortal blast,
      And blossom in a better Spring.
   Doubts of eternity ne‚Äôer cross
      The Lover‚Äôs mind, divinely clear;
   _For ever_ is the gain or loss
      Which maddens him with hope or fear:
   So trifles serve for his relief,
      And trifles make him sick and pale;
   And yet his pleasure and his grief
      Are both on a majestic scale.
   The chance, indefinitely small,
      Of issue infinitely great,
   Eclipses finite interests all,
      And has the dignity of fate.


II.
_Heaven and Earth_.


   How long shall men deny the flower
      Because its roots are in the earth,
   And crave with tears from God the dower
      They have, and have despised as dearth,
   And scorn as low their human lot,
      With frantic pride, too blind to see
   That standing on the head makes not
      Either for ease or dignity!
   But fools shall feel like fools to find
      (Too late inform‚Äôd) that angels‚Äô mirth
   Is one in cause, and mode, and kind
      With that which they profaned on earth.


√ÜTNA AND THE MOON.

1


   To soothe my heart I, feigning, seized
      A pen, and, showering tears, declared
   My unfeign‚Äôd passion; sadly pleased
      Only to dream that so I dared.
   Thus was the fervid truth confess‚Äôd,
      But wild with paradox ran the plea.
   As wilfully in hope depress‚Äôd,
      Yet bold beyond hope‚Äôs warranty:


2


   ‚ÄòO, more than dear, be more than just,
      And do not deafly shut the door!
   I claim no right to speak; I trust
      Mercy, not right; yet who has more?
   For, if more love makes not more fit,
      Of claimants here none‚Äôs more nor less,
   Since your great worth does not permit
      Degrees in our unworthiness.
   Yet, if there‚Äôs aught that can be done
      With arduous labour of long years,
   By which you‚Äôll say that you‚Äôll be won,
      O tell me, and I‚Äôll dry my tears.
   Ah, no; if loving cannot move,
      How foolishly must labour fail!
   The use of deeds is to show love;
      If signs suffice let these avail:
   Your name pronounced brings to my heart
      A feeling like the violet‚Äôs breath,
   Which does so much of heaven impart
      It makes me amorous of death;
   The winds that in the garden toss
      The Guelder-roses give me pain,
   Alarm me with the dread of loss,
      Exhaust me with the dream of gain;
   I‚Äôm troubled by the clouds that move;
      Tired by the breath which I respire;
   And ever, like a torch, my love,
      Thus agitated, flames the higher;
   All‚Äôs hard that has not you for goal;
      I scarce can move my hand to write,
   For love engages all my soul,
      And leaves the body void of might;
   The wings of will spread idly, as do
      The bird‚Äôs that in a vacuum lies;
   My breast, asleep with dreams of you,
      Forgets to breathe, and bursts in sighs;
   I see no rest this side the grave,
      No rest nor hope, from you apart;
   Your life is in the rose you gave,
      Its perfume suffocates my heart;
   There‚Äôs no refreshment in the breeze;
      The heaven o‚Äôerwhelms me with its blue;
   I faint beside the dancing seas;
      Winds, skies, and waves are only you;
   The thought or act which not intends
      You service seems a sin and shame;
   In that one only object ends
      Conscience, religion, honour, fame.
   Ah, could I put off love!  Could we
      Never have met!  What calm, what ease!
   Nay, but, alas, this remedy
      Were ten times worse than the disease!
   For when, indifferent, I pursue
      The world‚Äôs best pleasures for relief,
   My heart, still sickening back to you,
      Finds none like memory of its grief;
   And, though ‚Äôtwere very hell to hear
      You felt such misery as I,
   All good, save you, were far less dear!
      Than is that ill with which I die
   Where‚Äôer I go, wandering forlorn,
      You are the world‚Äôs love, life, and glee:
   Oh, wretchedness not to be borne
      If she that‚Äôs Love should not love me!‚Äô

   I could not write another word,
      Through pity for my own distress;
   And forth I went, untimely stirr‚Äôd
      To make my misery more or less.
   I went, beneath the heated noon,
      To where, in her simplicity,
   She sate at work; and, as the Moon
      On √Ütna smiles, she smiled on me.
   But, now and then, in cheek and eyes,
      I saw, or fancied, such a glow
   As when, in summer-evening skies,
      Some say, ‚ÄòIt lightens,‚Äô some say, ‚ÄòNo.‚Äô
   ‚ÄòHonoria,‚Äô I began‚ÄîNo more.
      The Dean, by ill or happy hap,
   Came home; and Wolf burst in before,
      And put his nose upon her lap.

   WHAT‚ÄôS that, which, ere I spake, was gone?
      So joyful and intense a spark
   That, whilst o‚Äôerhead the wonder shone,
      The day, before but dull, grew dark.
   I do not know; but this I know,
      That, had the splendour lived a year,
   The truth that I some heavenly show
      Did see, could not be now more clear.
   This know I too: might mortal breath
      Express the passion then inspired,
   Evil would die a natural death,
      And nothing transient be desired;
   And error from the soul would pass,
      And leave the senses pure and strong
   As sunbeams.  But the best, alas,
      Has neither memory nor tongue!


II.
_The Revelation_.


   An idle poet, here and there,
      Looks round him; but, for all the rest,
   The world, unfathomably fair,
      Is duller than a witling‚Äôs jest.
   Love wakes men, once a lifetime each;
      They lift their heavy lids, and look;
   And, lo, what one sweet page can teach,
      They read with joy, then shut the book.
   And some give thanks, and some blaspheme,
      And most forget; but, either way,
   That and the Child‚Äôs unheeded dream
      Is all the light of all their day.


III.
_The Spirit‚Äôs Epochs_.


   Not in the crises of events,
      Of compass‚Äôd hopes, or fears fulfill‚Äôd,
   Or acts of gravest consequence,
      Are life‚Äôs delight and depth reveal‚Äôd.
   The day of days was not the day;
      That went before, or was postponed;
   The night Death took our lamp away
      Was not the night on which we groan‚Äôd.
   I drew my bride, beneath the moon,
      Across my threshold; happy hour!
   But, ah, the walk that afternoon
      We saw the water-flags in flower!


IV.
_The Prototype_.


   Lo, there, whence love, life, light are pour‚Äôd,
      Veil‚Äôd with impenetrable rays,
   Amidst the presence of the Lord
      Co-equal Wisdom laughs and plays.
   Female and male God made the man;
      His image is the whole, not half;
   And in our love we dimly scan
      The love which is between Himself.


V.
_The Praise of Love_.


   Spirit of Knowledge, grant me this:
      A simple heart and subtle wit
   To praise the thing whose praise it is
      That all which can be praised is it.


SARUM PLAIN.

   Breakfast enjoy‚Äôd, ‚Äômid hush of boughs
      And perfumes thro‚Äô the windows blown;
   Brief worship done, which still endows
      The day with beauty not its own;
   With intervening pause, that paints
      Each act with honour, life with calm
   (As old processions of the Saints
      At every step have wands of palm),
   We rose; the ladies went to dress,
      And soon return‚Äôd with smiles; and then,
   Plans fix‚Äôd, to which the Dean said ‚ÄòYes,‚Äô
      Once more we drove to Salisbury Plain.
   We past my house (observed with praise
      By Mildred, Mary acquiesced),
   And left the old and lazy greys
      Below the hill, and walk‚Äôd the rest.


2


   The moods of love are like the wind,
      And none knows whence or why they rise:
   I ne‚Äôer before felt heart and mind
      So much affected through mine eyes.
   How cognate with the flatter‚Äôd air,
      How form‚Äôd for earth‚Äôs familiar zone,
   She moved; how feeling and how fair
      For others‚Äô pleasure and her own!
   And, ah, the heaven of her face!
      How, when she laugh‚Äôd, I seem‚Äôd to see
   The gladness of the primal grace,
      And how, when grave, its dignity!
   Of all she was, the least not less
      Delighted the devoted eye;
   No fold or fashion of her dress
      Her fairness did not sanctify.
   I could not else than grieve.  What cause?
      Was I not blest?  Was she not there?
   Likely my own?  Ah, that it was:
      How like seem‚Äôd ‚Äòlikely‚Äô to despair!


3


   And yet to see her so benign,
      So honourable and womanly,
   In every maiden kindness mine,
      And full of gayest courtesy,
   Was pleasure so without alloy,
      Such unreproved, sufficient bliss,
   I almost wish‚Äôd, the while, that joy
      Might never further go than this.
   So much it was as now to walk,
      And humbly by her gentle side
   Observe her smile and hear her talk,
      Could it be more to call her Bride?
   I feign‚Äôd her won: the mind finite,
      Puzzled and fagg‚Äôd by stress and strain
   To comprehend the whole delight,
      Made bliss more hard to bear than pain.
   All good, save heart to hold, so summ‚Äôd
      And grasp‚Äôd, the thought smote, like a knife,
   How laps‚Äôd mortality had numb‚Äôd
      The feelings to the feast of life;
   How passing good breathes sweetest breath;
      And love itself at highest reveals
   More black than bright, commending death
      By teaching how much life conceals.

   But happier passions these subdued,
      When from the close and sultry lane,
   With eyes made bright by what they view‚Äôd,
      We emerged upon the mounded Plain.
   As to the breeze a flag unfurls,
      My spirit expanded, sweetly embraced
   By those same gusts that shook her curls
      And vex‚Äôd the ribbon at her waist.
   To the future cast I future cares;
      Breathed with a heart unfreighted, free,
   And laugh‚Äôd at the presumptuous airs
      That with her muslins folded me;
   Till, one vague rack along my sky,
      The thought that she might ne‚Äôer be mine
   Lay half forgotten by the eye
      So feasted with the sun‚Äôs warm shine.

   By the great stones we chose our ground
      For shade; and there, in converse sweet,
   Took luncheon.  On a little mound
      Sat the three ladies; at their feet
   I sat; and smelt the heathy smell,
      Pluck‚Äôd harebells, turn‚Äôd the telescope
   To the country round.  My life went well,
      For once, without the wheels of hope;
   And I despised the Druid rocks
      That scowl‚Äôd their chill gloom from above,
   Like churls whose stolid wisdom mocks
      The lightness of immortal love.
   And, as we talk‚Äôd, my spirit quaff‚Äôd
      The sparkling winds; the candid skies
   At our untruthful strangeness laugh‚Äôd;
      I kiss‚Äôd with mine her smiling eyes;
   And sweet familiarness and awe
      Prevail‚Äôd that hour on either part,
   And in the eternal light I saw
      That she was mine; though yet my heart
   Could not conceive, nor would confess
      Such contentation; and there grew
   More form and more fair stateliness
      Than heretofore between us two.

PRELUDES.

I.
_The Wife‚Äôs Tragedy_.


   MAN must be pleased; but him to please
      Is woman‚Äôs pleasure; down the gulf
   Of his condoled necessities
      She casts her best, she flings herself.
   How often flings for nought, and yokes
      Her heart to an icicle or whim,
   Whose each impatient word provokes
      Another, not from her, but him;
   While she, too gentle even to force
      His penitence by kind replies,
   Waits by, expecting his remorse,
      With pardon in her pitying eyes;
   And if he once, by shame oppress‚Äôd,
      A comfortable word confers,
   She leans and weeps against his breast,
      And seems to think the sin was hers;
   And whilst his love has any life,
      Or any eye to see her charms,
   At any time, she‚Äôs still his wife,
      Dearly devoted to his arms;
   She loves with love that cannot tire;
      And when, ah woe, she loves alone,
   Through passionate duty love springs higher,
      As grass grows taller round a stone.


II.
_Common Graces_.


   Is nature in thee too spiritless,
      Ignoble, impotent, and dead,
   To prize her love and loveliness
      The more for being thy daily bread?
   And art thou one of that vile crew
      Which see no splendour in the sun,
   Praising alone the good that‚Äôs new,
      Or over, or not yet begun?
   And has it dawn‚Äôd on thy dull wits
      That love warms many as soft a nest,
   That, though swathed round with benefits,
      Thou art not singularly blest?
   And fail thy thanks for gifts divine,
      The common food of many a heart,
   Because they are not only thine?
      Beware lest in the end thou art
   Cast for thy pride forth from the fold,
      Too good to feel the common grace
   Of blissful myriads who behold
      For evermore the Father‚Äôs face.


III.
_The Zest of Life_.


   Give thanks.  It is not time misspent;
      Worst fare this betters, and the best,
   Wanting this natural condiment,
      Breeds crudeness, and will not digest.
   The grateful love the Giver‚Äôs law;
      But those who eat, and look no higher,
   From sin or doubtful sanction draw
      The biting sauce their feasts require.
   Give thanks for nought, if you‚Äôve no more,
      And, having all things, do not doubt
   That nought, with thanks, is blest before
      Whate‚Äôer the world can give, without.


IV.
_Fool and Wise_.


   Endow the fool with sun and moon,
      Being his, he holds them mean and low,
   But to the wise a little boon
      Is great, because the giver‚Äôs so.


SAHARA.

   I stood by Honor and the Dean,
      They seated in the London train.
   A month from her! yet this had been,
      Ere now, without such bitter pain.
   But neighbourhood makes parting light,
      And distance remedy has none;
   Alone, she near, I felt as might
      A blind man sitting in the sun;
   She near, all for the time was well;
      Hope‚Äôs self, when we were far apart,
   With lonely feeling, like the smell
      Of heath on mountains, fill‚Äôd my heart.
   To see her seem‚Äôd delight‚Äôs full scope,
      And her kind smile, so clear of care,
   Ev‚Äôn then, though darkening all my hope,
      Gilded the cloud of my despair.


2


   She had forgot to bring a book.
      I lent one; blamed the print for old;
   And did not tell her that she took
      A Petrarch worth its weight in gold.
   I hoped she‚Äôd lose it; for my love
      Was grown so dainty, high, and nice,
   It prized no luxury above
      The sense of fruitless sacrifice.


3


   The bell rang, and, with shrieks like death,
      Link catching link, the long array,
   With ponderous pulse and fiery breath,
      Proud of its burthen, swept away;
   And through the lingering crowd I broke,
      Sought the hill-side, and thence, heart-sick,
   Beheld, far off, the little smoke
      Along the landscape kindling quick.


4


   What should I do, where should I go,
      Now she was gone, my love! for mine
   She was, whatever here below
      Cross‚Äôd or usurp‚Äôd my right divine.
   Life, without her, was vain and gross,
      The glory from the world was gone,
   And on the gardens of the Close
      As on Sahara shone the sun.
   Oppress‚Äôd with her departed grace,
      My thoughts on ill surmises fed;
   The harmful influence of the place
      She went to fill‚Äôd my soul with dread.
   She, mixing with the people there,
      Might come back alter‚Äôd, having caught
   The foolish, fashionable air
      Of knowing all, and feeling nought.
   Or, giddy with her beauty‚Äôs praise,
      She‚Äôd scorn our simple country life,
   Its wholesome nights and tranquil days.
      And would not deign to be my Wife.
   ‚ÄòMy Wife,‚Äô ‚Äòmy Wife,‚Äô ah, tenderest word!
      How oft, as fearful she might hear,
   Whispering that name of ‚ÄòWife,‚Äô I heard
      The chiming of the inmost sphere.


5


   I pass‚Äôd the home of my regret.
      The clock was striking in the hall,
   And one sad window open yet,
      Although the dews began to fall.
   Ah, distance show‚Äôd her beauty‚Äôs scope!
      How light of heart and innocent
   That loveliness which sicken‚Äôd hope
      And wore the world for ornament!
   How perfectly her life was framed;
      And, thought of in that passionate mood,
   How her affecting graces shamed
      The vulgar life that was but good!


6


   I wonder‚Äôd, would her bird be fed,
      Her rose-plots water‚Äôd, she not by;
   Loading my breast with angry dread
      Of light, unlikely injury.
   So, fill‚Äôd with love and fond remorse,
      I paced the Close, its every part
   Endow‚Äôd with reliquary force
      To heal and raise from death my heart.
   How tranquil and unsecular
      The precinct!  Once, through yonder gate,
   I saw her go, and knew from far
      Her love-lit form and gentle state.
   Her dress had brush‚Äôd this wicket; here
      She turn‚Äôd her face, and laugh‚Äôd, with light
   Like moonbeams on a wavering mere.
      Weary beforehand of the night,
   I went; the blackbird, in the wood
      Talk‚Äôd by himself, and eastward grew
   In heaven the symbol of my mood,
      Where one bright star engross‚Äôd the blue.

_The Joyful Wisdom_.


   WOULD Wisdom for herself be woo‚Äôd,
      And wake the foolish from his dream,
   She must be glad as well as good,
      And must not only be, but seem.
   Beauty and joy are hers by right;
      And, knowing this, I wonder less
   That she‚Äôs so scorn‚Äôd, when falsely dight
      In misery and ugliness.
   What‚Äôs that which Heaven to man endears,
      And that which eyes no sooner see
   Than the heart says, with floods of tears,
      ‚ÄòAh, that‚Äôs the thing which I would be!‚Äô
   Not childhood, full of frown and fret;
      Not youth, impatient to disown
   Those visions high, which to forget
      Were worse than never to have known;
   Not worldlings, in whose fair outside
      Nor courtesy nor justice fails,
   Thanks to cross-pulling vices tied,
      Like Samson‚Äôs foxes, by the tails;
   Not poets; real things are dreams,
      When dreams are as realities,
   And boasters of celestial gleams
      Go stumbling aye for want of eyes;
   Not patriots or people‚Äôs men,
      In whom two worse-match‚Äôd evils meet
   Than ever sought Adullam‚Äôs den,
      Base conscience and a high conceit;
   Not new-made saints, their feelings iced,
      Their joy in man and nature gone,
   Who sing ‚ÄòO easy yoke of Christ!‚Äô
      But find ‚Äôtis hard to get it on;
   Not great men, even when they‚Äôre good;
      The good man whom the time makes great,
   By some disgrace of chance or blood,
      God fails not to humiliate;
   Not these: but souls, found here and there,
      Oases in our waste of sin,
   Where everything is well and fair,
      And Heav‚Äôn remits its discipline;
   Whose sweet subdual of the world
      The worldling scarce can recognise,
   And ridicule, against it hurl‚Äôd,
      Drops with a broken sting and dies;
   Who nobly, if they cannot know
      Whether a ‚Äôscutcheon‚Äôs dubious field
   Carries a falcon or a crow,
      Fancy a falcon on the shield;
   Yet, ever careful not to hurt
      God‚Äôs honour, who creates success,
   Their praise of even the best desert
      Is but to have presumed no less;
   Who, should their own life plaudits bring,
      Are simply vex‚Äôd at heart that such
   An easy, yea, delightful thing
      Should move the minds of men so much.
   They live by law, not like the fool,
      But like the bard, who freely sings
   In strictest bonds of rhyme and rule,
      And finds in them, not bonds, but wings.
   Postponing still their private ease
      To courtly custom, appetite,
   Subjected to observances,
      To banquet goes with full delight;
   Nay, continence and gratitude
      So cleanse their lives from earth‚Äôs alloy,
   They taste, in Nature‚Äôs common food,
      Nothing but spiritual joy.
   They shine like Moses in the face,
      And teach our hearts, without the rod,
   That God‚Äôs grace is the only grace,
      And all grace is the grace of God.

_The Devices_.


   Love, kiss‚Äôd by Wisdom, wakes twice Love,
      And Wisdom is, thro‚Äô loving, wise.
   Let Dove and Snake, and Snake and Dove,
      This Wisdom‚Äôs be, that Love‚Äôs device.


GOING TO CHURCH.

1


   I woke at three; for I was bid
      To breakfast with the Dean at nine,
   And thence to Church.  My curtain slid,
      I found the dawning Sunday fine,
   And could not rest, so rose.  The air
      Was dark and sharp; the roosted birds
   Cheep‚Äôd, ‚ÄòHere am I, Sweet; are you there?‚Äô
      On Avon‚Äôs misty flats the herds
   Expected, comfortless, the day,
      Which slowly fired the clouds above;
   The cock scream‚Äôd, somewhere far away;
      In sleep the matrimonial dove
   Was crooning; no wind waked the wood,
      Nor moved the midnight river-damps,
   Nor thrill‚Äôd the poplar; quiet stood
      The chestnut with its thousand lamps;
   The moon shone yet, but weak and drear,
      And seem‚Äôd to watch, with bated breath,
   The landscape, all made sharp and clear
      By stillness, as a face by death.


2


   My pray‚Äôrs for her being done, I took
      Occasion by the quiet hour
   To find and know, by Rule and Book,
      The rights of love‚Äôs beloved power.


3


   Fronting the question without ruth,
      Nor ignorant that, evermore,
   If men will stoop to kiss the Truth,
      She lifts them higher than before,
   I, from above, such light required
      As now should once for all destroy
   The folly which at times desired
      A sanction for so great a joy.


4


   Thenceforth, and through that pray‚Äôr, I trod
      A path with no suspicions dim.
   I loved her in the name of God,
      And for the ray she was of Him;
   I ought to admire much more, not less
      Her beauty was a godly grace;
   The mystery of loveliness,
      Which made an altar of her face,
   Was not of the flesh, though that was fair,
      But a most pure and living light
   Without a name, by which the rare
      And virtuous spirit flamed to sight.
   If oft, in love, effect lack‚Äôd cause
      And cause effect, ‚Äôtwere vain to soar
   Reasons to seek for that which was
      Reason itself, or something more.
   My joy was no idolatry
      Upon the ends of the vile earth bent,
   For when I loved her most then I
      Most yearn‚Äôd for more divine content.
   That other doubt, which, like a ghost,
      In the brain‚Äôs darkness haunted me,
   Was thus resolved: Him loved I most,
      But her I loved most sensibly.
   Lastly, my giddiest hope allow‚Äôd
      No selfish thought, or earthly smirch;
   And forth I went, in peace, and proud
      To take my passion into Church;
   Grateful and glad to think that all
      Such doubts would seem entirely vain
   To her whose nature‚Äôs lighter fall
      Made no divorce of heart from brain.


5


   I found them, with exactest grace
      And fresh as Spring, for Spring attired;
   And by the radiance in her face
      I saw she felt she was admired;
   And, through the common luck of love,
      A moment‚Äôs fortunate delay,
   To fit the little lilac glove,
      Gave me her arm; and I and they
   (They true to this and every hour,
      As if attended on by Time),
   Enter‚Äôd the Church while yet the tower
      Was noisy with the finish‚Äôd chime.


6


   Her soft voice, singularly heard
      Beside me, in her chant, withstood
   The roar of voices, like a bird
      Sole warbling in a windy wood;
   And, when we knelt, she seem‚Äôd to be
      An angel teaching me to pray;
   And all through the high Liturgy
      My spirit rejoiced without allay,
   Being, for once, borne clearly above
      All banks and bars of ignorance,
   By this bright spring-tide of pure love,
      And floated in a free expanse,
   Whence it could see from side to side,
      The obscurity from every part
   Winnow‚Äôd away and purified
      By the vibrations of my heart.

PRELUDES.

I.
_The Daughter of Eve_.


   THE woman‚Äôs gentle mood o‚Äôerstept
      Withers my love, that lightly scans
   The rest, and does in her accept
      All her own faults, but none of man‚Äôs.
   As man I cannot judge her ill,
      Or honour her fair station less,
   Who, with a woman‚Äôs errors, still
      Preserves a woman‚Äôs gentleness;
   For thus I think, if one I see
      Who disappoints my high desire,
   ‚ÄòHow admirable would she be,
      Could she but know how I admire!‚Äô
   Or fail she, though from blemish clear,
      To charm, I call it my defect;
   And so my thought, with reverent fear
      To err by doltish disrespect,
   Imputes love‚Äôs great regard, and says,
      ‚ÄòThough unapparent ‚Äôtis to me,
   Be sure this Queen some other sways
      With well-perceiv‚Äôd supremacy.‚Äô
   Behold the worst!  Light from above
      On the blank ruin writes ‚ÄòForbear!
   Her first crime was unguarded love,
      And all the rest, perhaps, despair.‚Äô
   Discrown‚Äôd, dejected, but not lost,
      O, sad one, with no more a name
   Or place in all the honour‚Äôd host
      Of maiden and of matron fame,
   Grieve on; but, if thou grievest right,
      ‚ÄôTis not that these abhor thy state,
   Nor would‚Äôst thou lower the least the height
      Which makes thy casting down so great.
   Good is thy lot in its degree;
      For hearts that verily repent
   Are burden‚Äôd with impunity
      And comforted by chastisement.
   Sweet patience sanctify thy woes!
      And doubt not but our God is just,
   Albeit unscathed thy traitor goes,
      And thou art stricken to the dust.
   That penalty‚Äôs the best to bear
      Which follows soonest on the sin;
   And guilt‚Äôs a game where losers fare
      Better than those who seem to win.


II.
_Aurea Dicta_.


   ‚ÄôTis truth (although this truth‚Äôs a star
      Too deep-enskied for all to see),
   As poets of grammar, lovers are
      The fountains of morality.

   Child, would you shun the vulgar doom,
      In love disgust, in death despair?
   Know, death must come and love must come,
      And so for each your soul prepare.

   Who pleasure follows pleasure slays;
      God‚Äôs wrath upon himself he wreaks;
   But all delights rejoice his days
      Who takes with thanks, and never seeks.

   The wrong is made and measured by
      The right‚Äôs inverted dignity.
   Change love to shame, as love is high
      So low in hell your bed shall be.

   How easy to keep free from sin!
      How hard that freedom to recall!
   For dreadful truth it is that men
      Forget the heavens from which they fall.

   Lest sacred love your soul ensnare,
      With pious fancy still infer
   ‚ÄòHow loving and how lovely fair
      Must He be who has fashion‚Äôd her!‚Äô

   Become whatever good you see,
      Nor sigh if, forthwith, fades from view
   The grace of which you may not be
      The subject and spectator too.

   Love‚Äôs perfect blossom only blows
      Where noble manners veil defect
   Angels maybe familiar; those
      Who err each other must respect.

   Love blabb‚Äôd of is a great decline;
      A careless word unsanctions sense;
   But he who casts Heaven‚Äôs truth to swine
      Consummates all incontinence.

   Not to unveil before the gaze
      Of an imperfect sympathy
   In aught we are, is the sweet praise
      And the main sum of modesty.


THE DANCE.

1


   ‚ÄòMy memory of Heaven awakes!
      She‚Äôs not of the earth, although her light,
   As lantern‚Äôd by her body, makes
      A piece of it past bearing bright.
   So innocently proud and fair
      She is, that Wisdom sings for glee
   And Folly dies, breathing one air
      With such a bright-cheek‚Äôd chastity;
   And though her charms are a strong law
      Compelling all men to admire,
   They go so clad with lovely awe
      None but the noble dares desire.
   He who would seek to make her his
      Will comprehend that souls of grace
   Own sweet repulsion, and that ‚Äôtis
      The quality of their embrace
   To be like the majestic reach
      Of coupled suns, that, from afar,
   Mingle their mutual spheres, while each
      Circles the twin obsequious star;
   And, in the warmth of hand to hand,
      Of heart to heart, he‚Äôll vow to note
   And reverently understand
      How the two spirits shine remote;
   And ne‚Äôer to numb fine honour‚Äôs nerve,
      Nor let sweet awe in passion melt,
   Nor fail by courtesies to observe
      The space which makes attraction felt;
   Nor cease to guard like life the sense
      Which tells him that the embrace of love
   Is o‚Äôer a gulf of difference
      Love cannot sound, nor death remove.‚Äô


2


   This learn‚Äôd I, watching where she danced,
      Native to melody and light,
   And now and then toward me glanced,
      Pleased, as I hoped, to please my sight.


3


   Ah, love to speak was impotent,
      Till music did a tongue confer,
   And I ne‚Äôer knew what music meant,
      Until I danced to it with her.
   Too proud of the sustaining power
      Of my, till then, unblemish‚Äôd joy.
   My passion, for reproof, that hour
      Tasted mortality‚Äôs alloy,
   And bore me down an eddying gulf;
      I wish‚Äôd the world might run to wreck,
   So I but once might fling myself
      Obliviously about her neck.
   I press‚Äôd her hand, by will or chance
      I know not, but I saw the rays
   Withdrawn, which did till then enhance
      Her fairness with its thanks for praise.
   I knew my spirit‚Äôs vague offence
      Was patent to the dreaming eye
   And heavenly tact of innocence,
      And did for fear my fear defy,
   And ask‚Äôd her for the next dance.  ‚ÄòYes.‚Äô
      ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô had not fall‚Äôn with half the force.
   She was fulfill‚Äôd with gentleness,
      And I with measureless remorse;
   And, ere I slept, on bended knee
      I own‚Äôd myself, with many a tear,
   Unseasonable, disorderly,
      And a deranger of love‚Äôs sphere;
   Gave thanks that, when we stumble and fall,
      We hurt ourselves, and not the truth;
   And, rising, found its brightness all
      The brighter through the tears of ruth.


4


   Nor was my hope that night made less,
      Though order‚Äôd, humbled, and reproved;
   Her farewell did her heart express
      As much, but not with anger, moved.
   My trouble had my soul betray‚Äôd;
      And, in the night of my despair,
   My love, a flower of noon afraid,
      Divulged its fulness unaware.
   I saw she saw; and, O sweet Heaven,
      Could my glad mind have credited
   That influence had to me been given
      To affect her so, I should have said
   That, though she from herself conceal‚Äôd
      Love‚Äôs felt delight and fancied harm,
   They made her face the jousting field
      Of joy and beautiful alarm.



CANTO XII.
The Abdication.


PRELUDES.

I.
_The Chace_.


   SHE wearies with an ill unknown;
      In sleep she sobs and seems to float,
   A water-lily, all alone
      Within a lonely castle-moat;
   And as the full-moon, spectral, lies
      Within the crescent‚Äôs gleaming arms,
   The present shows her heedless eyes
      A future dim with vague alarms.
   She sees, and yet she scarcely sees,
      For, life-in-life not yet begun,
   Too many are its mysteries
      For thought to fix on any one.
   She‚Äôs told that maidens are by youths
      Extremely honour‚Äôd and desired;
   And sighs, ‚ÄòIf those sweet tales be truths,
      What bliss to be so much admired!‚Äô
   The suitors come; she sees them grieve;
      Her coldness fills them with despair;
   She‚Äôd pity if she could believe;
      She‚Äôs sorry that she cannot care.
   But who now meets her on her way?
      Comes he as enemy or friend,
   Or both?  Her bosom seems to say,
      He cannot pass, and there an end.
   Whom does he love?  Does he confer
      His heart on worth that answers his?
   Or is he come to worship her?
      She fears, she hopes, she thinks he is!
   Advancing stepless, quick, and still,
      As in the grass a serpent glides,
   He fascinates her fluttering will,
      Then terrifies with dreadful strides.
   At first, there‚Äôs nothing to resist;
      He fights with all the forms of peace;
   He comes about her like a mist,
      With subtle, swift, unseen increase;
   And then, unlook‚Äôd for, strikes amain
      Some stroke that frightens her to death,
   And grows all harmlessness again,
      Ere she can cry, or get her breath.
   At times she stops, and stands at bay;
      But he, in all more strong than she,
   Subdues her with his pale dismay,
      Or more admired audacity.
   She plans some final, fatal blow,
      But when she means with frowns to kill,
   He looks as if he loved her so,
      She smiles to him against her will.
   How sweetly he implies her praise!
      His tender talk, his gentle tone,
   The manly worship in his gaze,
      They nearly make her heart his own.
   With what an air he speaks her name;
      His manner always recollects
   Her sex, and still the woman‚Äôs claim
      Is taught its scope by his respects.
   Her charms, perceived to prosper first
      In his beloved advertencies,
   When in her glass they are rehearsed,
      Prove his most powerful allies.
   Ah, whither shall a maiden flee,
      When a bold youth so swift pursues,
   And siege of tenderest courtesy,
      With hope perseverant, still renews!
   Why fly so fast?  Her flatter‚Äôd breast
      Thanks him who finds her fair and good;
   She loves her fears; veil‚Äôd joys arrest
      The foolish terrors of her blood;
   By secret, sweet degrees, her heart,
      Vanquish‚Äôd, takes warmth from his desire;
   She makes it more, with hidden art,
      And fuels love‚Äôs late dreaded fire.
   The generous credit he accords
      To all the signs of good in her
   Redeems itself; his praiseful words
      The virtues they impute confer.
   Her heart is thrice as rich in bliss,
      She‚Äôs three times gentler than before;
   He gains a right to call her his,
      Now she through him is so much more;
   ‚ÄôTis heaven where‚Äôer she turns her head;
      ‚ÄôTis music when she talks; ‚Äôtis air
   On which, elate, she seems to tread,
      The convert of a gladder sphere!
   Ah, might he, when by doubts aggrieved,
      Behold his tokens next her breast,
   At all his words and sighs perceived
      Against its blythe upheaval press‚Äôd!
   But still she flies.  Should she be won,
      It must not be believed or thought
   She yields; she‚Äôs chased to death, undone,
      Surprised, and violently caught.


II.
_Denied_.


   The storm-cloud, whose portentous shade
      Fumes from a core of smother‚Äôd fire,
   His livery is whose worshipp‚Äôd maid
      Denies herself to his desire.
   Ah, grief that almost crushes life,
      To lie upon his lonely bed,
   And fancy her another‚Äôs wife!
      His brain is flame, his heart is lead.
   Sinking at last, by nature‚Äôs course,
      Cloak‚Äôd round with sleep from his despair,
   He does but sleep to gather force
      That goes to his exhausted care.
   He wakes renew‚Äôd for all the smart.
      His only Love, and she is wed!
   His fondness comes about his heart,
      As milk comes, when the babe is dead.
   The wretch, whom she found fit for scorn,
      His own allegiant thoughts despise;
   And far into the shining morn
      Lazy with misery he lies.


III.
_The Churl_.


   This marks the Churl: when spousals crown
      His selfish hope, he finds the grace,
   Which sweet love has for ev‚Äôn the clown,
      Was not in the woman, but the chace.


THE ABDICATION.

1


   From little signs, like little stars,
      Whose faint impression on the sense
   The very looking straight at mars,
      Or only seen by confluence;
   From instinct of a mutual thought,
      Whence sanctity of manners flow‚Äôd;
   From chance unconscious, and from what
      Concealment, overconscious, show‚Äôd;
   Her hand‚Äôs less weight upon my arm,
      Her lowlier mien; that match‚Äôd with this;
   I found, and felt with strange alarm
      I stood committed to my bliss.


2


   I grew assured, before I ask‚Äôd,
      That she‚Äôd be mine without reserve,
   And in her unclaim‚Äôd graces bask‚Äôd,
      At leisure, till the time should serve,
   With just enough of dread to thrill
      The hope, and make it trebly dear;
   Thus loth to speak the word to kill
      Either the hope or happy fear.


3


   Till once, through lanes returning late,
      Her laughing sisters lagg‚Äôd behind;
   And, ere we reach‚Äôd her father‚Äôs gate,
      We paused with one presentient mind;
   And, in the dim and perfumed mist,
      Their coming stay‚Äôd, who, friends to me,
   And very women, loved to assist
      Love‚Äôs timid opportunity.


4


   Twice rose, twice died my trembling word;
      The faint and frail Cathedral chimes
   Spake time in music, and we heard
      The chafers rustling in the limes.
   Her dress, that touch‚Äôd me where I stood,
      The warmth of her confided arm,
   Her bosom‚Äôs gentle neighbourhood,
      Her pleasure in her power to charm;
   Her look, her love, her form, her touch,
      The least seem‚Äôd most by blissful turn,
   Blissful but that it pleased too much,
      And taught the wayward soul to yearn.
   It was as if a harp with wires
      Was traversed by the breath I drew;
   And, oh, sweet meeting of desires,
      She, answering, own‚Äôd that she loved too.


5


   Honoria was to be my bride!
      The hopeless heights of hope were scaled
   The summit won, I paused and sigh‚Äôd,
      As if success itself had fail‚Äôd.
   It seem‚Äôd as if my lips approach‚Äôd
      To touch at Tantalus‚Äô reward,
   And rashly on Eden life encroach‚Äôd,
      Half-blinded by the flaming sword.
   The whole world‚Äôs wealthiest and its best,
      So fiercely sought, appear‚Äôd when found,
   Poor in its need to be possess‚Äôd,
      Poor from its very want of bound.
   My queen was crouching at my side,
      By love unsceptred and brought low,
   Her awful garb of maiden pride
      All melted into tears like snow;
   The mistress of my reverent thought,
      Whose praise was all I ask‚Äôd of fame,
   In my close-watch‚Äôd approval sought
      Protection as from danger and blame;
   Her soul, which late I loved to invest
      With pity for my poor desert,
   Buried its face within my breast,
      Like a pet fawn by hunters hurt.

THE PROLOGUE.


1


   HER sons pursue the butterflies,
      Her baby daughter mocks the doves
   With throbbing coo; in his fond eyes
      She‚Äôs Venus with her little Loves;
   Her footfall dignifies the earth,
      Her form‚Äôs the native-land of grace,
   And, lo, his coming lights with mirth
      Its court and capital her face!
   Full proud her favour makes her lord,
      And that her flatter‚Äôd bosom knows.
   She takes his arm without a word,
      In lanes of laurel and of rose.
   Ten years to-day has she been his.
      He but begins to understand,
   He says, the dignity and bliss
      She gave him when she gave her hand.
   She, answering, says, he disenchants
      The past, though that was perfect; he
   Rejoins, the present nothing wants
      But briefness to be ecstasy.
   He lands her charms; her beauty‚Äôs glow
      Wins from the spoiler Time new rays;
   Bright looks reply, approving so
      Beauty‚Äôs elixir vit√¶, praise.
   Upon a beech he bids her mark
      Where, ten years since, he carved her name;
   It grows there with the growing bark,
      And in his heart it grows the same.
   For that her soft arm presses his
      Close to her fond, maternal breast;
   He tells her, each new kindness is
      The effectual sum of all the rest!
   And, whilst the cushat, mocking, coo‚Äôd,
      They blest the days they had been wed,
   At cost of those in which he woo‚Äôd,
      Till everything was three times said;
   And words were growing vain, when Briggs,
      Factotum, Footman, Butler, Groom,
   Who press‚Äôd the cyder, fed the pigs,
      Preserv‚Äôd the rabbits, drove the brougham,
   And help‚Äôd, at need, to mow the lawns,
      And sweep the paths and thatch the hay,
   Here brought the Post down, Mrs. Vaughan‚Äôs
      Sole rival, but, for once, to-day,
   Scarce look‚Äôd at; for the ‚ÄòSecond Book,‚Äô
      Till this tenth festival kept close,
   Was thus commenced, while o‚Äôer them shook
      The laurel married with the rose.

   ‚ÄòThe pulse of War, whose bloody heats
      Sane purposes insanely work,
   Now with fraternal frenzy beats,
      And binds the Christian to the Turk,
   And shrieking fifes‚Äô‚Äî


3


         But, with a roar,
      In rush‚Äôd the Loves; the tallest roll‚Äôd
   A hedgehog from his pinafore,
      Which saved his fingers; Baby, bold,
   Touch‚Äôd it, and stared, and scream‚Äôd for life,
      And stretch‚Äôd her hand for Vaughan to kiss,
   Who hugg‚Äôd his Pet, and ask‚Äôd his wife,
      ‚ÄòIs this for love, or love for this?‚Äô
   But she turn‚Äôd pale, for, lo, the beast,
      Found stock-still in the rabbit-trap,
   And feigning so to be deceased,
      And laid by Frank upon her lap,
   Unglobed himself, and show‚Äôd his snout,
      And fell, scatt‚Äôring the Loves amain,
   With shriek, with laughter, and with shout;
      And, peace at last restored again,
   The bard, who this untimely hitch
      Bore with a calm magnanimous,
   (The hedgehog rolled into a ditch,
      And Venus sooth‚Äôd), proceeded thus:

PRELUDES.

I.
_The Song of Songs_.


   THE pulse of War, whose bloody heats
      Sane purposes insanely work,
   Now with fraternal frenzy beats,
      And binds the Christian to the Turk,
   And shrieking fifes and braggart flags,
      Through quiet England, teach our breath
   The courage corporate that drags
      The coward to heroic death.
   Too late for song!  Who henceforth sings,
      Must fledge his heavenly flight with more
   Song-worthy and heroic things
      Than hasty, home-destroying war.
   While might and right are not agreed,
      And battle thus is yet to wage,
   So long let laurels be the meed
      Of soldier as of poet sage;
   But men expect the Tale of Love,
      And weary of the Tale of Hate;
   Lift me, O Muse, myself above,
      And let the world no longer wait!


II.
_The Kites_.


   I saw three Cupids (so I dream‚Äôd),
      Who made three kites, on which were drawn,
   In letters that like roses gleam‚Äôd,
      ‚ÄòPlato,‚Äô ‚ÄòAnacreon,‚Äô and ‚ÄòVaughan.‚Äô
   The boy who held by Plato tried
      His airy venture first; all sail,
   It heav‚Äônward rush‚Äôd till scarce descried,
      Then pitch‚Äôd and dropp‚Äôd for want of tail.
   Anacreon‚Äôs Love, with shouts of mirth
      That pride of spirit thus should fall,
   To his kite link‚Äôd a lump of earth,
      And, lo, it would not soar at all.
   Last, my disciple freighted his
      With a long streamer made of flowers,
   The children of the sod, and this
      Rose in the sun, and flew for hours.


III.
_Orpheus_.


   The music of the Sirens found
      Ulysses weak, though cords were strong;
   But happier Orpheus stood unbound,
      And shamed it with a sweeter song.
   His mode be mine.  Of Heav‚Äôn I ask,
      May I, with heart-persuading might,
   Pursue the Poet‚Äôs sacred task
      Of superseding faith by sight,
   Till ev‚Äôn the witless Gadarene,
      Preferring Christ to swine, shall know
   That life is sweetest when it‚Äôs clean.
      To prouder folly let me show
   Earth by divine light made divine;
      And let the saints, who hear my word,
   Say, ‚ÄòLo, the clouds begin to shine
      About the coming of the Lord!‚Äô


IV.
_Nearest the Dearest_.


   Till Eve was brought to Adam, he
      A solitary desert trod,
   Though in the great society
      Of nature, angels, and of God.
   If one slight column counterweighs
      The ocean, ‚Äôtis the Maker‚Äôs law,
   Who deems obedience better praise
      Than sacrifice of erring awe.


V.
_Perspective_.


   What seems to us for us is true.
      The planet has no proper light,
   And yet, when Venus is in view,
      No primal star is half so bright.

   What fortune did my heart foretell?
      What shook my spirit, as I woke,
   Like the vibration of a bell
      Of which I had not heard the stroke?
   Was it some happy vision shut
      From memory by the sun‚Äôs fresh ray?
   Was it that linnet‚Äôs song; or but
      A natural gratitude for day?
   Or the mere joy the senses weave,
      A wayward ecstasy of life?
   Then I remember‚Äôd, yester-eve
      I won Honoria for my Wife.

   Forth riding, while as yet the day
      Was dewy, watching Sarum Spire,
   Still beckoning me along my way,
      And growing every minute higher,
   I reach‚Äôd the Dean‚Äôs.  One blind was down,
      Though nine then struck.  My bride to be!
   And had she rested ill, my own,
      With thinking (oh, my heart!) of me?
   I paced the streets; a pistol chose,
      To guard my now important life
   When riding late from Sarum Close;
      At noon return‚Äôd.  Good Mrs. Fife,
   To my, ‚ÄòThe Dean, is he at home?‚Äô
      Said, ‚ÄòNo, sir; but Miss Honor is;‚Äô
   And straight, not asking if I‚Äôd come,
      Announced me, ‚ÄòMr. Felix, Miss,‚Äô
   To Mildred, in the Study.  There
      We talk‚Äôd, she working.  We agreed
   The day was fine; the Fancy-Fair
      Successful; ‚ÄòDid I ever read
   De Genlis?‚Äô  ‚ÄòNever.‚Äô  ‚ÄòDo!  She heard
      I was engaged.‚Äô  ‚ÄòTo whom?‚Äô  ‚ÄòMiss Fry
   Was it the fact?‚Äô  ‚ÄòNo!‚Äô  ‚ÄòOn my word?‚Äô
      ‚ÄòWhat scandal people talk‚Äôd!‚Äô  ‚ÄòWould I
   Hold out this skein of silk.‚Äô  So pass‚Äôd
      I knew not how much time away.
   ‚ÄòHow were her sisters?‚Äô  ‚ÄòWell.‚Äô  At last
      I summon‚Äôd heart enough to say,
   ‚ÄòI hoped to have seen Miss Churchill too.‚Äô
      ‚ÄòMiss Churchill, Felix!  What is this?
   I said, and now I find ‚Äôtis true,
      Last night you quarrell‚Äôd!  Here she is.‚Äô


3


   She came, and seem‚Äôd a morning rose
      When ruffling rain has paled its blush;
   Her crown once more was on her brows;
      And, with a faint, indignant flush,
   And fainter smile, she gave her hand,
      But not her eyes, then sate apart,
   As if to make me understand
      The honour of her vanquish‚Äôd heart.
   But I drew humbly to her side;
      And she, well pleased, perceiving me
   Liege ever to the noble pride
      Of her unconquer‚Äôd majesty,
   Once and for all put it away;
      The faint flush pass‚Äôd; and, thereupon,
   Her loveliness, which rather lay
      In light than colour, smiled and shone,
   Till sick was all my soul with bliss;
      Or was it with remorse and ire
   Of such a sanctity as this
      Subdued by love to my desire?



CANTO II.
The Course of True Love.


PRELUDES.

I.
_The Changed Allegiance_.


   WATCH how a bird, that captived sings,
      The cage set open, first looks out,
   Yet fears the freedom of his wings,
      And now withdraws, and flits about,
   And now looks forth again; until,
      Grown bold, he hops on stool and chair,
   And now attains the window-sill,
      And now confides himself to air.
   The maiden so, from love‚Äôs free sky
      In chaste and prudent counsels caged,
   But longing to be loosen‚Äôd by
      Her suitor‚Äôs faith declared and gaged,
   When blest with that release desired,
      First doubts if truly she is free,
   Then pauses, restlessly retired,
      Alarm‚Äôd at too much liberty;
   But soon, remembering all her debt
      To plighted passion, gets by rote
   Her duty; says, ‚ÄòI love him!‚Äô yet
      The thought half chokes her in her throat;
   And, like that fatal ‚ÄòI am thine,‚Äô
      Comes with alternate gush and check
   And joltings of the heart, as wine
      Pour‚Äôd from a flask of narrow neck.
   Is he indeed her choice?  She fears
      Her Yes was rashly said, and shame,
   Remorse and ineffectual tears
      Revolt from has conceded claim.
   Oh, treason!  So, with desperate nerve,
      She cries, ‚ÄòI am in love, am his;‚Äô
   Lets run the cables of reserve,
      And floats into a sea of bliss,
   And laughs to think of her alarm,
      Avows she was in love before,
   Though has avowal was the charm
      Which open‚Äôd to her own the door.
   She loves him for his mastering air,
      Whence, Parthian-like, she slaying flies;
   His flattering look, which seems to wear
      Her loveliness in manly eyes;
   His smile, which, by reverse, portends
      An awful wrath, should reason stir;
   (How fortunate it is they‚Äôre friends,
      And he will ne‚Äôer be wroth with her!)
   His power to do or guard from harm;
      If he but chose to use it half,
   And catch her up in one strong arm,
      What could she do but weep, or laugh!
   His words, which still instruct, but so
      That this applause seems still implied,
   ‚ÄòHow wise in all she ought to know,
      How ignorant of all beside!‚Äô
   His skilful suit, which leaves her free,
      Gives nothing for the world to name,
   And keeps her conscience safe, while he,
      With half the bliss, takes all the blame;
   His clear repute with great and small;
      The jealousy his choice will stir;
   But ten times more than ten times all,
      She loves him for his love of her.
   How happy ‚Äôtis he seems to see
      In her that utter loveliness
   Which she, for his sake, longs to be!
      At times, she cannot but confess
   Her other friends are somewhat blind;
      Her parents‚Äô years excuse neglect,
   But all the rest are scarcely kind,
      And brothers grossly want respect;
   And oft she views what he admires
      Within her glass, and sight of this
   Makes all the sum of her desires
      To be devotion unto his.
   But still, at first, whatever‚Äôs done,
      A touch, her hand press‚Äôd lightly, she
   Stands dizzied, shock‚Äôd, and flush‚Äôd, like one
      Set sudden neck-deep in the sea;
   And, though her bond for endless time
      To his good pleasure gives her o‚Äôer,
   The slightest favour seems a crime,
      Because it makes her love him more.
   But that she ne‚Äôer will let him know;
      For what were love should reverence cease?
   A thought which makes her reason so
      Inscrutable, it seems caprice.
   With her, as with a desperate town,
      Too weak to stand, too proud to treat,
   The conqueror, though the walls are down,
      Has still to capture street by street;
   But, after that, habitual faith,
      Divorced from self, where late ‚Äôtwas due,
   Walks nobly in its novel path,
      And she‚Äôs to changed allegiance true;
   And prizing what she can‚Äôt prevent,
      (Right wisdom, often misdeem‚Äôd whim),
   Her will‚Äôs indomitably bent
      On mere submissiveness to him;
   To him she‚Äôll cleave, for him forsake
      Father‚Äôs and mother‚Äôs fond command!
   He is her lord, for he can take
      Hold of her faint heart with his hand.


II.
_Beauty_.


   ‚ÄòBeauty deludes.‚Äô  O shaft well shot,
      To strike the mark‚Äôs true opposite!
   That ugly good is scorn‚Äôd proves not
      ‚ÄôTis beauty lies, but lack of it.
   By Heaven‚Äôs law the Jew might take
      A slave to wife, if she was fair;
   So strong a plea does beauty make
      That, where ‚Äôtis seen, discretion‚Äôs there.
   If, by a monstrous chance, we learn
      That this illustrious vaunt‚Äôs a lie,
   Our minds, by which the eyes discern,
      See hideous contrariety.
   And laugh at Nature‚Äôs wanton mood,
      Which, thus a swinish thing to flout,
   Though haply in its gross way good,
      Hangs such a jewel in its snout.


III.
_Lais and Lucretia_.


   Did first his beauty wake her sighs?
      That‚Äôs Lais!  Thus Lucretia‚Äôs known:
   The beauty in her Lover‚Äôs eyes
      Was admiration of her own.


THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE.

1


   Oh, beating heart of sweet alarm,
      Which stays the lover‚Äôs step, when near
   His mistress and her awful charm
      Of grace and innocence sincere!
   I held the half-shut door, and heard
      The voice of my betrothed wife,
   Who sang my verses, every word
      By music taught its latent life;
   With interludes of well-touch‚Äôd notes,
      That flash‚Äôd, surprising and serene,
   As meteor after meteor floats
      The soft, autumnal stars between.
   There was a passion in her tone,
      A tremor when she touch‚Äôd the keys,
   Which told me she was there alone,
      And uttering all her soul at ease.
   I enter‚Äôd; for I did not choose
      To learn how in her heart I throve,
   By chance or stealth; beyond her use,
      Her greeting flatter‚Äôd me with love.


2


   With true love‚Äôs treacherous confidence,
      And ire, at last to laughter won,
   She spoke this speech, and mark‚Äôd its sense,
      By action, as her Aunt had done.


3


   ‚Äò‚ÄúYou, with your looks and catching air,
      To think of Vaughan!  You fool!  You know,
   You might, with ordinary care,
      Ev‚Äôn yet be Lady Clitheroe.
   You‚Äôre sure he‚Äôll do great things some day!
      Nonsense, he won‚Äôt; he‚Äôs dress‚Äôd too well.
   Dines with the Sterling Club, they say;
      Not commonly respectable!
   Half Puritan, half Cavalier!
      His curly hair I think‚Äôs a wig;
   And, for his fortune, why my Dear,
      ‚ÄôTis not enough to keep a gig.
   Rich Aunts and Uncles never die;
      And what you bring won‚Äôt do for dress:
   And so you‚Äôll live on By-and-by,
      Within oaten-cake and water-cress!‚Äù


4


   ‚ÄòI cried, but did not let her see.
      At last she soften‚Äôd her dispraise,
   On learning you had bought for me
      A carriage and a pair of bays.
   But here she comes!  You take her in
      To dinner.  I impose this task
   Make her approve my love; and win
      What thanks from me you choose to ask!‚Äô


5


   ‚ÄòMy niece has told you every word
      I said of you!  What may I mean?
   Of course she has; but you‚Äôve not heard
      How I abused you to the Dean;‚Äî
   Yes, I‚Äôll take wine; he‚Äôs mad, like her;
      And she _will_ have you: there it ends!
   And, now I‚Äôve done my duty, Sir,
      And you‚Äôve shown common-sense, we‚Äôre friends!‚Äô


6


   ‚ÄòGo, child, and see him out yourself,‚Äô
      Aunt Maude said, after tea, ‚Äòand show
   The place, upon that upper shelf,
      Where Petrarch stands, lent long ago.‚Äô


7


   ‚ÄòThese rose-leaves to my heart be press‚Äôd,
      Honoria, while it aches for you!‚Äô
   (The rose in ruin, from her breast,
      Fell, as I took a fond adieu.)
   ‚ÄòYou must go now, Love!‚Äô  ‚ÄòSee, the air
      Is thick with starlight!‚Äô  ‚ÄòLet me tie
   This scarf on.  Oh, your Petrarch!  There!
      I‚Äôm coming, Aunt!‚Äô  ‚ÄòSweet, Sweet!‚Äô  ‚ÄòGood-bye!‚Äô
   ‚ÄòAh, Love, to me ‚Äôtis death to part,
      Yet you, my sever‚Äôd life, smile on!‚Äô
   These ‚ÄúGood-nights,‚Äù Felix, break my heart;
      I‚Äôm only gay till you are gone!‚Äô
   With love‚Äôs bright arrows from her eyes,
      And balm on her permissive lips,
   She pass‚Äôd, and night was a surprise,
      As when the sun at Quito dips.
   Her beauties were like sunlit snows,
      Flush‚Äôd but not warm‚Äôd with my desire.
   Oh, how I loved her!  Fiercely glows
      In the pure air of frost the fire.
   Who for a year is sure of fate!
      I thought, dishearten‚Äôd as I went,
   Wroth with the Dean, who bade me wait,
      And vex‚Äôd with her, who seem‚Äôd content.
   Nay, could eternal life afford
      That tyranny should thus deduct
   From this fair land, which call‚Äôd me lord,
      A year of the sweet usufruct?
   It might not and it should not be!
      I‚Äôd go back now, and he must own,
   At once, my love‚Äôs compulsive plea.
      I turn‚Äôd, I found the Dean alone.
   ‚ÄòNonsense, my friend; go back to bed!
      It‚Äôs half-past twelve!‚Äô  ‚ÄòJuly, then, Sir!‚Äô
   ‚ÄòWell, come to-morrow,‚Äô at last he said,
      ‚ÄòAnd you may talk of it with her.‚Äô
   A light gleam‚Äôd as I pass‚Äôd the stair.
      A pausing foot, a flash of dress,
   And a sweet voice.  ‚ÄòIs Felix there?‚Äô
      ‚ÄòJuly, Love!‚Äô  ‚ÄòSays Papa so?‚Äô  ‚ÄòYes!‚Äô



CANTO III.
The Country Ball.


PRELUDES.

I.
_Love Ceremonious_.


   KEEP your undrest, familiar style
      For strangers, but respect your friend,
   Her most, whose matrimonial smile
      Is and asks honour without end.
   ‚ÄôTis found, and needs it must so be,
      That life from love‚Äôs allegiance flags,
   When love forgets his majesty
      In sloth‚Äôs unceremonious rags.
   Let love make home a gracious Court;
      There let the world‚Äôs rude, hasty ways
   Be fashion‚Äôd to a loftier port,
      And learn to bow and stand at gaze;
   And let the sweet respective sphere
      Of personal worship there obtain
   Circumference for moving clear,
      None treading on another‚Äôs train.
   This makes that pleasures do not cloy,
      And dignifies our mortal strife
   With calmness and considerate joy,
      Befitting our immortal life.


II.
_The Rainbow_.


   A stately rainbow came and stood,
      When I was young, in High-Hurst Park;
   Its bright feet lit the hill and wood
      Beyond, and cloud and sward were dark;
   And I, who thought the splendour ours
      Because the place was, t‚Äôwards it flew,
   And there, amidst the glittering showers,
      Gazed vainly for the glorious view.
   With whatsoever‚Äôs lovely, know
      It is not ours; stand off to see,
   Or beauty‚Äôs apparition so
      Puts on invisibility.


III.
_A Paradox_.


   To tryst Love blindfold goes, for fear
      He should not see, and eyeless night
   He chooses still for breathing near
      Beauty, that lives but in the sight.


THE COUNTY BALL.

1


   Well, Heaven be thank‚Äôd my first-love fail‚Äôd,
      As, Heaven be thank‚Äôd, our first-loves do!
   Thought I, when Fanny past me sail‚Äôd,
      Loved once, for what I never knew,
   Unless for colouring in her talk,
      When cheeks and merry mouth would show
   Three roses on a single stalk,
      The middle wanting room to blow,
   And forward ways, that charm‚Äôd the boy
      Whose love-sick mind, misreading fate,
   Scarce hoped that any Queen of Joy
      Could ever stoop to be his mate.


2


   But there danced she, who from the leaven
      Of ill preserv‚Äôd my heart and wit
   All unawares, for she was heaven,
      Others at best but fit for it.
   One of those lovely things she was
      In whose least action there can be
   Nothing so transient but it has
      An air of immortality.
   I mark‚Äôd her step, with peace elate,
      Her brow more beautiful than morn,
   Her sometime look of girlish state
      Which sweetly waived its right to scorn;
   The giddy crowd, she grave the while,
      Although, as ‚Äôtwere beyond her will,
   Around her mouth the baby smile
      That she was born with linger‚Äôd still.
   Her ball-dress seem‚Äôd a breathing mist,
      From the fair form exhaled and shed,
   Raised in the dance with arm and wrist
      All warmth and light, unbraceleted.
   Her motion, feeling ‚Äôtwas beloved,
      The pensive soul of tune express‚Äôd,
   And, oh, what perfume, as she moved,
      Came from the flowers in her breast!
   How sweet a tongue the music had!
      ‚ÄòBeautiful Girl,‚Äô it seem‚Äôd to say,
   ‚ÄòThough all the world were vile and sad,
      Dance on; let innocence be gay.‚Äô
   Ah, none but I discern‚Äôd her looks,
      When in the throng she pass‚Äôd me by,
   For love is like a ghost, and brooks
      Only the chosen seer‚Äôs eye;
   And who but she could e‚Äôer divine
      The halo and the happy trance,
   When her bright arm reposed on mine,
      In all the pauses of the dance!


3


   Whilst so her beauty fed my sight,
      And whilst I lived in what she said,
   Accordant airs, like all delight
      Most sweet when noted least, were play‚Äôd;
   And was it like the Pharisee
      If I in secret bow‚Äôd my face
   With joyful thanks that I should be,
      Not as were many, but with grace
   And fortune of well-nurtured youth,
      And days no sordid pains defile,
   And thoughts accustom‚Äôd to the truth,
      Made capable of her fair smile?


4


   Charles Barton follow‚Äôd down the stair,
      To talk with me about the Ball,
   And carp at all the people there.
      The Churchills chiefly stirr‚Äôd his gall:
   ‚ÄòSuch were the Kriemhilds and Isondes
      You storm‚Äôd about at Trinity!
   Nothing at heart but handsome Blondes!
      ‚ÄòFolk say that you and Fanny Fry‚Äî‚Äô
   ‚ÄòThey err!  Good-night!  Here lies my course,
      Through Wilton.‚Äô  Silence blest my ears,
   And, weak at heart with vague remorse,
      A passing poignancy of tears
   Attack‚Äôd mine eyes.  By pale and park
      I rode, and ever seem‚Äôd to see,
   In the transparent starry dark,
      That splendid brow of chastity,
   That soft and yet subduing light,
      At which, as at the sudden moon,
   I held my breath, and thought ‚Äòhow bright!‚Äô
      That guileless beauty in its noon,
   Compelling tribute of desires
      Ardent as day when Sirius reigns,
   Pure as the permeating fires
      That smoulder in the opal‚Äôs veins.



CANTO IV.
Love in Idleness.


PRELUDES.

I.
_Honour and Desert_.


   O QUEEN, awake to thy renown,
      Require what ‚Äôtis our wealth to give,
   And comprehend and wear the crown
      Of thy despised prerogative!
   I, who in manhood‚Äôs name at length
      With glad songs come to abdicate
   The gross regality of strength,
      Must yet in this thy praise abate,
   That, through thine erring humbleness
      And disregard of thy degree,
   Mainly, has man been so much less
      Than fits his fellowship with thee.
   High thoughts had shaped the foolish brow,
      The coward had grasp‚Äôd the hero‚Äôs sword,
   The vilest had been great, hadst thou,
      Just to thyself, been worth‚Äôs reward.
   But lofty honours undersold
      Seller and buyer both disgrace;
   And favours that make folly bold
      Banish the light from virtue‚Äôs face.


II.
_Love and Honour_.


   What man with baseness so content,
      Or sick with false conceit of right,
   As not to know that the element
      And inmost warmth of love‚Äôs delight
   Is honour?  Who‚Äôd not rather kiss
      A duchess than a milkmaid, prank
   The two in equal grace, which is
      Precedent Nature‚Äôs obvious rank?
   Much rather, then, a woman deck‚Äôd
      With saintly honours, chaste and good,
   Whose thoughts celestial things affect,
      Whose eyes express her heavenly mood!
   Those lesser vaunts are dimm‚Äôd or lost
      Which plume her name or paint her lip,
   Extinct in the deep-glowing boast
      Of her angelic fellowship.


III.
_Valour Misdirected_.


   I‚Äôll hunt for dangers North and South,
      To prove my love, which sloth maligns!‚Äô
   What seems to say her rosy mouth?
      ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not convinced by proofs but signs.‚Äô


LOVE IN IDLENESS.

1


   What should I do?  In such a wife
      Fortune had lavish‚Äôd all her store,
   And nothing now seem‚Äôd left for life
      But to deserve her more and more.
   To this I vow‚Äôd my life‚Äôs whole scope;
      And Love said, ‚ÄòI forewarn you now,
   The Maiden will fulfill your hope
      Only as you fulfil your vow.‚Äô


2


   A promised service, (task for days),
      Was done this morning while she slept,
   With that full heart which thinks no praise
      Of vows which are not more than kept;
   But loftier work did love impose.
      And studious hours.  Alas, for these,
   While she from all my thoughts arose
      Like Venus from the restless seas!


3


   I conn‚Äôd a scheme, within mind elate:
      My Uncle‚Äôs land would fall to me,
   My skill was much in school debate,
      My friends were strong in Salisbury;
   A place in Parliament once gain‚Äôd,
      Thro‚Äô saps first labour‚Äôd out of sight,
   Far loftier peaks were then attain‚Äôd
      With easy leaps from height to height;
   And that o‚Äôerwhelming honour paid,
      Or recognised, at least, in life,
   Which this most sweet and noble Maid
      Should yield to him who call‚Äôd her Wife.


4


   I fix‚Äôd this rule: in Sarum Close
      To make two visits every week,
   The first, to-day; and, save on those,
      I nought would do, think, read, or speak,
   Which did not help my settled will
      To earn the Statesman‚Äôs proud applause.
   And now, forthwith, to mend my skill
      In ethics, politics, and laws,
   The Statesman‚Äôs learning!  Flush‚Äôd with power
      And pride of freshly-form‚Äôd resolve,
   I read Helvetius half-an-hour;
      But, halting in attempts to solve
   Why, more than all things else that be,
      A lady‚Äôs grace hath force to move
   That sensitive appetency
      Of intellectual good, call‚Äôd love,
   Took Blackstone down, only to draw
      My swift-deriving thoughts ere long
   To love, which is the source of law,
      And, like a king, can do no wrong;
   Then open‚Äôd Hyde, where loyal hearts,
      With faith unpropp‚Äôd by precedent,
   Began to play rebellious parts.
      O, mighty stir that little meant!
   How dull the crude, plough‚Äôd fields of fact
      To me who trod the Elysian grove!
   How idle all heroic act
      By the least suffering of love!
   I could not read; so took my pen,
      And thus commenced, in form of notes,
   A Lecture for the Salisbury men,
      With due regard to Tory votes:
   ‚ÄòA road‚Äôs a road, though worn to ruts;
      They speed who travel straight therein;
   But he who tacks and tries short cuts
      Gets fools‚Äô praise and a broken shin‚Äî‚Äô
   And here I stopp‚Äôd in sheer despair;
      But, what to-day was thus begun,
   I vow‚Äôd, up starting from my chair,
      To-morrow should indeed be done;
   So loosed my chafing thoughts from school,
      To play with fancy as they chose,
   And then, according to my rule,
      I dress‚Äôd, and came to Sarum Close.

   Ah, that sweet laugh!  Diviner sense
      Did Nature, forming her, inspire
   To omit the grosser elements,
      And make her all of air and fire!

   To-morrow, Cowes‚Äô Regatta fell:
      The Dean would like his girls to go,
   If I went too.  ‚ÄòMost gladly.‚Äô  Well,
      I did but break a foolish vow!
   Unless Love‚Äôs toil has love for prize,
      (And then he‚Äôs Hercules), above
   All other contrarieties
      Is labour contrary to love.
   No fault of Love‚Äôs, but nature‚Äôs laws!
      And Love, in idleness, lies quick;
   For as the worm whose powers make pause,
      And swoon, through alteration sick,
   The soul, its wingless state dissolved,
      Awaits its nuptial life complete,
   All indolently self-convolved,
      Cocoon‚Äôd in silken fancies sweet.

   ‚ÄòPERHAPS she‚Äôs dancing somewhere now!‚Äô
      The thoughts of light and music wake
   Sharp jealousies, that grow and grow
      Till silence and the darkness ache.
   He sees her step, so proud and gay,
      Which, ere he spake, foretold despair:
   Thus did she look, on such a day,
      And such the fashion of her hair;
   And thus she stood, when, kneeling low,
      He took the bramble from her dress,
   And thus she laugh‚Äôd and talk‚Äôd, whose ‚ÄòNo‚Äô
      Was sweeter than another‚Äôs ‚ÄòYes.‚Äô
   He feeds on thoughts that most deject;
      He impudently feigns her charms,
   So reverenced in his own respect,
      Dreadfully clasp‚Äôd by other arms;
   And turns, and puts his brows, that ache,
      Against the pillow where ‚Äôtis cold.
   If, only now his heart would break!
      But, oh, how much a heart can hold.


II.
_Rachel_.


   You loved her, and would lie all night
      Thinking how beautiful she was,
   And what to do for her delight.
      Now both are bound with alien laws!
   Be patient; put your heart to school;
      Weep if you will, but not despair;
   The trust that nought goes wrong by rule
      Should ease this load the many bear.
   Love, if there‚Äôs heav‚Äôn, shall meet his dues,
      Though here unmatch‚Äôd, or match‚Äôd amiss;
   Meanwhile, the gentle cannot choose
      But learn to love the lips they kiss.
   Ne‚Äôer hurt the homely sister‚Äôs ears
      With Rachel‚Äôs beauties; secret be
   The lofty mind whose lonely tears
      Protest against mortality.

THE QUEEN‚ÄôS ROOM.

   There‚Äôs nothing happier than the days
      In which young Love makes every thought
   Pure as a bride‚Äôs blush, when she says
      ‚ÄòI will‚Äô unto she knows not what;
   And lovers, on the love-lit globe,
      For love‚Äôs sweet sake, walk yet aloof,
   And hear Time weave the marriage-robe,
      Attraction warp and reverence woof.

   My Housekeeper, my Nurse of yore,
      Cried, as the latest carriage went,
   ‚ÄòWell, Mr, Felix, Sir, I‚Äôm sure
      The morning‚Äôs gone off excellent!
   I never saw the show to pass
      The ladies, in their fine fresh gowns,
   So sweetly dancing on the grass,
      To music with its ups and downs.
   We‚Äôd such work, Sir, to clean the plate;
      ‚ÄôTwas just the busy times of old.
   The Queen‚Äôs Room, Sir, look‚Äôd quite like state.
      Miss Smythe, when she went up, made bold
   To peep into the Rose Boudoir,
      And cried, ‚ÄúHow charming! all quite new;‚Äù
   And wonder‚Äôd who it could be for.
      All but Miss Honor look‚Äôd in too.
   But she‚Äôs too proud to peep and pry.
      None‚Äôs like that sweet Miss Honor, Sir!
   Excuse my humbleness, but I
      Pray Heav‚Äôn you‚Äôll get a wife like her!
   The Poor love dear Miss Honor‚Äôs ways
      Better than money.  Mrs. Rouse,
   Who ought to know a lady, says
      No finer goes to Wilton House.
   Miss Bagshaw thought that dreary room
      Had kill‚Äôd old Mrs. Vaughan with fright;
   She would not sleep in such a tomb
      For all her host was worth a night!
   Miss Fry, Sir, laugh‚Äôd; they talk‚Äôd the rest
      In French; and French Sir‚Äôs Greek to me;
   But, though they smiled, and seem‚Äôd to jest,
      No love was lost, for I could see
   How serious-like Miss Honor was‚Äî‚Äô
      ‚ÄòWell, Nurse, this is not my affair.
   The ladies talk‚Äôd in French with cause.
      Good-day; and thank you for your prayer.‚Äô

   I loiter‚Äôd through the vacant house,
      Soon to be her‚Äôs; in one room stay‚Äôd,
   Of old my mother‚Äôs.  Here my vows
      Of endless thanks were oftenest paid.
   This room its first condition kept;
      For, on her road to Sarum Town,
   Therein an English Queen had slept,
      Before the Hurst was half pull‚Äôd down.
   The pictured walls the place became:
      Here ran the Brook Anaurus, where
   Stout Jason bore the wrinkled dame
      Whom serving changed to Juno; there,
   Ixion‚Äôs selfish hope, instead
      Of the nuptial goddess, clasp‚Äôd a cloud;
   And, here, translated Psyche fed
      Her gaze on Love, not disallow‚Äôd.

   And in this chamber had she been,
      And into that she would not look,
   My Joy, my Vanity, my Queen,
      At whose dear name my pulses shook!
   To others how express at all
      My worship in that joyful shrine?
   I scarcely can myself recall
      What peace and ardour then were mine;
   And how more sweet than aught below,
      The daylight and its duties done,
   It felt to fold the hands, and so
      Relinquish all regards but one;
   To see her features in the dark,
      To lie and meditate once more
   The grace I did not fully mark,
      The tone I had not heard before;
   And from my pillow then to take
      Her notes, her picture, and her glove,
   Put there for joy when I should wake,
      And press them to the heart of love;
   And then to whisper ‚ÄòWife!‚Äô and pray
      To live so long as not to miss
   That unimaginable day
      Which farther seems the nearer ‚Äôtis;
   And still from joy‚Äôs unfathom‚Äôd well
      To drink, in dreams, while on her brows
   Of innocence ineffable
      Blossom‚Äôd the laughing bridal rose.

I.
_Love‚Äôs Perversity_.


   HOW strange a thing a lover seems
      To animals that do not love!
   Lo, where he walks and talks in dreams,
      And flouts us with his Lady‚Äôs glove;
   How foreign is the garb he wears;
      And how his great devotion mocks
   Our poor propriety, and scares
      The undevout with paradox!
   His soul, through scorn of worldly care,
      And great extremes of sweet and gall,
   And musing much on all that‚Äôs fair,
      Grows witty and fantastical;
   He sobs his joy and sings his grief,
      And evermore finds such delight
   In simply picturing his relief,
      That ‚Äôplaining seems to cure his plight;
   He makes his sorrow, when there‚Äôs none;
      His fancy blows both cold and hot;
   Next to the wish that she‚Äôll be won,
      His first hope is that she may not;
   He sues, yet deprecates consent;
      Would she be captured she must fly;
   She looks too happy and content,
      For whose least pleasure he would die;
   Oh, cruelty, she cannot care
      For one to whom she‚Äôs always kind!
   He says he‚Äôs nought, but, oh, despair,
      If he‚Äôs not Jove to her fond mind!
   He‚Äôs jealous if she pets a dove,
      She must be his with all her soul;
   Yet ‚Äôtis a postulate in love
      That part is greater than the whole;
   And all his apprehension‚Äôs stress,
      When he‚Äôs with her, regards her hair,
   Her hand, a ribbon of her dress,
      As if his life were only there;
   Because she‚Äôs constant, he will change,
      And kindest glances coldly meet,
   And, all the time he seems so strange,
      His soul is fawning at her feet;
   Of smiles and simple heaven grown tired,
      He wickedly provokes her tears,
   And when she weeps, as he desired,
      Falls slain with ecstasies of fears;
   He blames her, though she has no fault,
      Except the folly to be his;
   He worships her, the more to exalt
      The profanation of a kiss;
   Health‚Äôs his disease, he‚Äôs never well
      But when his paleness shames her rose;
   His faith‚Äôs a rock-built citadel,
      Its sign a flag that each way blows;
   His o‚Äôerfed fancy frets and fumes;
      And Love, in him, is fierce, like Hate,
   And ruffles his ambrosial plumes
      Against the bars of time and fate.

_The Power of Love_.


   Samson the Mighty, Solomon
      The Wise, and Holy David all
   Must doff their crowns to Love, for none
      But fell as Love would scorn to fall!
   And what may fallen spirits win,
      When stripes and precepts cannot move?
   Only the sadness of all sin,
      When look‚Äôd at in the light of Love.


THE LOVE-LETTERS.

   ‚ÄòYou ask, Will admiration halt,
      Should spots appear within my Sun?
   Oh, how I wish I knew your fault,
      For Love‚Äôs tired gaze to rest upon!
   Your graces, which have made me great,
      Will I so loftily admire,
   Yourself yourself shall emulate,
      And be yourself your own desire.
   I‚Äôll nobly mirror you too fair,
      And, when you‚Äôre false to me your glass,
   What‚Äôs wanting you‚Äôll by that repair,
      So bring yourself through me to pass.
   O dearest, tell me how to prove
      Goodwill which cannot be express‚Äôd;
   The beneficial heart of love
      Is labour in an idle breast.
   Name in the world your chosen part,
      And here I vow, with all the bent
   And application of my heart
      To give myself to your content.
   Would you live on, home-worshipp‚Äôd, thus,
      Not proudly high nor poorly low?
   Indeed the lines are fall‚Äôn to us
      In pleasant places!  Be it so.
   But would you others heav‚Äônward move,
      By sight not faith, while you they admire?
   I‚Äôll help with zeal as I approve
      That just and merciful desire.
   High as the lonely moon to view
      I‚Äôll lift your light; do you decree
   Your place, I‚Äôll win it; for from you
      Command inspires capacity.
   Or, unseen, would you sway the world
      More surely?  Then in gracious rhyme
   I‚Äôll raise your emblem, fair unfurl‚Äôd
      With blessing in the breeze of time.
   Faith removes mountains, much more love;
      Let your contempt abolish me
   If ought of your devisal prove
      Too hard or high to do or be.‚Äô

   I ended.  ‚ÄòFrom your Sweet-Heart, Sir,‚Äô
      Said Nurse, ‚ÄòThe Dean‚Äôs man brings it down.‚Äô
   I could have kiss‚Äôd both him and her!
      ‚ÄòNurse, give him that, with half-a-crown.‚Äô
   How beat my heart, how paused my breath,
      When, with perversely fond delay,
   I broke the seal, that bore a wreath
      Of roses link‚Äôd with one of bay.

   ‚ÄòI found your note.  How very kind
      To leave it there!  I cannot tell
   How pleased I was, or how you find
      Words to express your thoughts so well.
   The Girls are going to the Ball
      At Wilton.  If you can, _do_ come;
   And any day this week you call
      Papa and I shall be at home.
   You said to Mary once‚ÄîI hope
      In jest‚Äîthat women _should_ be vain:
   On Saturday your friend (her Pope),
      The Bishop dined with us again.
   She put the question, if they ought?
      He turn‚Äôd it cleverly away
   (For giddy Mildred cried, she thought
      We _must_), with ‚ÄúWhat we must we may.‚Äù
   ‚ÄòDear papa laugh‚Äôd, and said ‚Äôtwas sad
      To think how vain his girls would be,
   Above all Mary, now she had
      Episcopal authority.
   But I was very dull, dear friend,
      And went upstairs at last, and cried.
   Be sure to come to-day, or send
      A rose-leaf kiss‚Äôd on either side.
   Adieu!  I am not well.  Last night
      My dreams were wild: I often woke,
   The summer-lightning was so bright;
      And when it flash‚Äôd I thought you spoke.‚Äô

_Joy and Use_.


   CAN ought compared with wedlock be
      For use?  But He who made the heart
   To use proportions joy.  What He
      Has join‚Äôd let no man put apart.
   Sweet Order has its draught of bliss
      Graced with the pearl of God‚Äôs consent,
   Ten times delightful in that ‚Äôtis
      Considerate and innocent.
   In vain Disorder grasps the cup;
      The pleasure‚Äôs not enjoy‚Äôd but spilt,
   And, if he stoops to lick it up,
      It only tastes of earth and guilt.
   His sorry raptures rest destroys;
      To live, like comets, they must roam;
   On settled poles turn solid joys,
      And sunlike pleasures shine at home.

‚Äò_She was Mine_.‚Äô


   ‚ÄòThy tears o‚Äôerprize thy loss!  Thy wife,
      In what was she particular?
   Others of comely face and life,
      Others as chaste and warm there are,
   And when they speak they seem to sing;
      Beyond her sex she was not wise;
   And there is no more common thing
      Than kindness in a woman‚Äôs eyes.
   Then wherefore weep so long and fast,
      Why so exceedingly repine!
   Say, how has thy Beloved surpass‚Äôd
      So much all others?‚Äô  ‚ÄòShe was mine.‚Äô


THE REVULSION.

   ‚ÄôTwas when the spousal time of May
      Hangs all the hedge with bridal wreaths,
   And air‚Äôs so sweet the bosom gay
      Give thanks for every breath it breathes,
   When like to like is gladly moved,
      And each thing joins in Spring‚Äôs refrain,
   ‚ÄòLet those love now who never loved;
      Let those who have loved love again;‚Äô
   That I, in whom the sweet time wrought,
      Lay stretch‚Äôd within a lonely glade,
   Abandon‚Äôd to delicious thought
      Beneath the softly twinkling shade.
   The leaves, all stirring, mimick‚Äôd well
      A neighbouring rush of rivers cold,
   And, as the sun or shadow fell,
      So these were green and those were gold;
   In dim recesses hyacinths droop‚Äôd,
      And breadths of primrose lit the air,
   Which, wandering through the woodland, stoop‚Äôd
      And gather‚Äôd perfumes here and there;
   Upon the spray the squirrel swung,
      And careless songsters, six or seven.
   Sang lofty songs the leaves among,
      Fit for their only listener, Heaven.
   I sigh‚Äôd, ‚ÄòImmeasurable bliss
      Gains nothing by becoming more!
   Millions have meaning; after this
      Cyphers forget the integer.‚Äô


2


   And so I mused, till musing brought
      A dream that shook my house of clay,
   And, in my humbled heart, I thought,
      To me there yet may come a day
   With this the single vestige seen
      Of comfort, earthly or divine,
   My sorrow some time must have been
      Her portion, had it not been mine.
   Then I, who knew, from watching life,
      That blows foreseen are slow to fall,
   Rehearsed the losing of a wife,
      And faced its terrors each and all.
   The self-chastising fancy show‚Äôd
      The coffin with its ghastly breath;
   The innocent sweet face that owed
      None of its innocence to death;
   The lips that used to laugh; the knell
      That bade the world beware of mirth;
   The heartless and intolerable
      Indignity of ‚Äòearth to earth;‚Äô
   At morn remembering by degrees
      That she I dream‚Äôd about was dead;
   Love‚Äôs still recurrent jubilees,
      The days that she was born, won, wed;
   The duties of my life the same,
      Their meaning for the feelings gone;
   Friendship impertinent, and fame
      Disgusting; and, more harrowing none,
   Small household troubles fall‚Äôn to me,
      As, ‚ÄòWhat time would I dine to-day?‚Äô
   And, oh, how could I bear to see
      The noisy children at their play.
   Besides, where all things limp and halt,
      Could I go straight, should I alone
   Have kept my love without default,
      Pitch‚Äôd at the true and heavenly tone?
   The festal-day might come to mind
      That miss‚Äôd the gift which more endears;
   The hour which might have been more kind,
      And now less fertile in vain tears;
   The good of common intercourse,
      For daintier pleasures, then despised,
   Now with what passionate remorse,
      What poignancy of hunger prized!
   The little wrong, now greatly rued,
      Which no repentance now could right;
   And love, in disbelieving mood,
      Deserting his celestial height.
   Withal to know, God‚Äôs love sent grief
      To make me less the world‚Äôs, and more
   Meek-hearted: ah, the sick relief!
      Why bow‚Äôd I not my heart before?


3


   ‚ÄòWhat,‚Äô I exclaimed, with chill alarm,
      ‚ÄòIf this fantastic horror shows
   The feature of an actual harm!‚Äô
      And, coming straight to Sarum Close,
   As one who dreams his wife is dead,
      And cannot in his slumber weep,
   And moans upon his wretched bed,
      And wakes, and finds her there asleep,
   And laughs and sighs, so I, not less
      Relieved, beheld, with blissful start,
   The light and happy loveliness
      Which lay so heavy on my heart.



CANTO VIII.
The Koh-i-noor.


PRELUDES.

I.
_In Love_.


   IF he‚Äôs capricious she‚Äôll be so,
      But, if his duties constant are,
   She lets her loving favour glow
      As steady as a tropic star;
   Appears there nought for which to weep,
      She‚Äôll weep for nought, for his dear sake;
   She clasps her sister in her sleep;
      Her love in dreams is most awake.
   Her soul, that once with pleasure shook,
      Did any eyes her beauty own,
   Now wonders how they dare to look
      On what belongs to him alone;
   The indignity of taking gifts
      Exhilarates her loving breast;
   A rapture of submission lifts
      Her life into celestial rest;
   There‚Äôs nothing left of what she was;
      Back to the babe the woman dies,
   And all the wisdom that she has
      Is to love him for being wise.
   She‚Äôs confident because she fears;
      And, though discreet when he‚Äôs away,
   If none but her dear despot hears,
      She prattles like a child at play.
   Perchance, when all her praise is said,
      He tells the news, a battle won,
   On either side ten thousand dead.
      ‚ÄòAlas!‚Äô she says; but, if ‚Äôtwere known,
   She thinks, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs looking on my face!
      I am his joy; whate‚Äôer I do,
   He sees such time-contenting grace
      In that, he‚Äôd have me always so!‚Äô
   And, evermore, for either‚Äôs sake,
      To the sweet folly of the dove,
   She joins the cunning of the snake,
      To rivet and exalt his love;
   Her mode of candour is deceit;
      And what she thinks from what she‚Äôll say
   (Although I‚Äôll never call her cheat),
      Lies far as Scotland from Cathay.
   Without his knowledge he was won;
      Against his nature kept devout;
   She‚Äôll never tell him how ‚Äôtwas done,
      And he will never find it out.
   If, sudden, he suspects her wiles,
      And hears her forging chain and trap,
   And looks, she sits in simple smiles,
      Her two hands lying in her lap.
   Her secret (privilege of the Bard,
      Whose fancy is of either sex),
   Is mine; but let the darkness guard
      Myst‚Äôries that light would more perplex!


II.
_Love Thinking_.


   What lifts her in my thought so far
      Beyond all else?  Let Love not err!
   ‚ÄôTis that which all right women are,
      But which I‚Äôll know in none but her.
   She is to me the only Ark
      Of that high mystery which locks
   The lips of joy, or speaks in dark
      Enigmas and in paradox;
   That potent charm, which none can fly,
      Nor would, which makes me bond and free,
   Nor can I tell if first ‚Äôtwas I
      Chose it, or it elected me;
   Which, when I look intentest, lo,
      Cheats most mine eyes, albeit my heart,
   Content to feel and not to know,
      Perceives it all in every part;
   I kiss its cheek; its life divine
      Exhales from its resplendent shroud;
   Ixion‚Äôs fate reversed is mine,
      Authentic Juno seems a cloud;
   I feel a blessed warmth, I see
      A bright circumference of rays,
   But darkness, where the sun should be,
      Fills admiration with amaze;
   And when, for joy‚Äôs relief, I think
      To fathom with the line of thought
   The well from which I, blissful, drink,
      The spring‚Äôs so deep I come to nought.

   ‚ÄòI saw you take his kiss!‚Äô  ‚Äò‚ÄôTis true.‚Äô
      ‚ÄòO, modesty!‚Äô  ‚Äò‚ÄôTwas strictly kept:
   He thought me asleep; at least, I knew
      He thought I thought he thought I slept.‚Äô


THE KOH-I-NOOR.

1


   ‚ÄòBe man‚Äôs hard virtues highly wrought,
      But let my gentle Mistress be,
   In every look, word, deed, and thought,
      Nothing but sweet and womanly!
   Her virtues please my virtuous mood,
      But what at all times I admire
   Is, not that she is wise or good,
      But just the thing which I desire.
   With versatility to sing
      The theme of love to any strain,
   If oft‚Äônest she is anything,
      Be it careless, talkative, and vain.
   That seems in her supremest grace
      Which, virtue or not, apprises me
   That my familiar thoughts embrace
      Unfathomable mystery.‚Äô


2


   I answer‚Äôd thus; for she desired
      To know what mind I most approved;
   Partly to learn what she inquired,
      Partly to get the praise she loved.


3


   I praised her, but no praise could fill
      The depths of her desire to please,
   Though dull to others as a Will
      To them that have no legacies.
   The more I praised the more she shone,
      Her eyes incredulously bright,
   And all her happy beauty blown
      Beneath the beams of my delight.
   Sweet rivalry was thus begot;
      By turns, my speech, in passion‚Äôs style,
   With flatteries the truth o‚Äôershot,
      And she surpass‚Äôd them with her smile.


4


   ‚ÄòYou have my heart so sweetly seiz‚Äôd,
      And I confess, nay, ‚Äôtis my pride
   That I‚Äôm with you so solely pleased,
      That, if I‚Äôm pleased with aught beside,
   As music, or the month of June,
      My friend‚Äôs devotion, or his wit,
   A rose, a rainbow, or the moon,
      It is that you illustrate it.
   All these are parts, you are the whole;
      You fit the taste for Paradise,
   To which your charms draw up the soul
      As turning spirals draw the eyes.
   Nature to you was more than kind;
      ‚ÄôTwas fond perversity to dress
   So much simplicity of mind
      In such a pomp of loveliness!
   But, praising you, the fancy deft
      Flies wide, and lets the quarry stray,
   And, when all‚Äôs said, there‚Äôs something left,
      And that‚Äôs the thing I meant to say.‚Äô
   ‚ÄòDear Felix!‚Äô  ‚ÄòSweet, my Love!‚Äô  But there
      Was Aunt Maude‚Äôs noisy ring and knock!
   ‚ÄòStay, Felix; you have caught my hair.
      Stoop!  Thank you!‚Äô  ‚ÄòMay I have that lock?‚Äô
   ‚ÄòNot now.  Good morning, Aunt!‚Äô  ‚ÄòWhy, Puss,
      You look magnificent to-day.‚Äô
   ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs Felix, Aunt.‚Äô  ‚ÄòFox and green goose!
      Who handsome gets should handsome pay!
   Aunt, you are friends!‚Äô  ‚ÄòAh, to be sure!
      Good morning!  Go on flattering, sir;
   A woman, like the Koh-i-noor,
      Mounts to the price that‚Äôs put on her.‚Äô

PRELUDES.

I.
_The Nursling of Civility_.


   LO, how the woman once was woo‚Äôd;
      Forth leapt the savage from his lair,
   And fell‚Äôd her, and to nuptials rude
      He dragg‚Äôd her, bleeding, by the hair.
   From that to Chloe‚Äôs dainty wiles
      And Portia‚Äôs dignified consent,
   What distance!  Bat these Pagan styles
      How far below Time‚Äôs fair intent!
   Siegfried sued Kriemhild.  Sweeter life
      Could Love‚Äôs self covet?  Yet ‚Äôtis snug
   In what rough sort he chid his wife
      For want of curb upon her tongue!
   Shall Love, where last I leave him, halt?
      Nay; none can fancy or forsee
   To how strange bliss may time exalt
      This nursling of civility.


II.
_The Foreign Land_.


   A woman is a foreign land,
      Of which, though there he settle young,
   A man will ne‚Äôer quite understand
      The customs, politics, and tongue.
   The foolish hie them post-haste through,
      See fashions odd, and prospects fair,
   Learn of the language, ‚ÄòHow d‚Äôye do,‚Äô
      And go and brag they have been there.
   The most for leave to trade apply,
      For once, at Empire‚Äôs seat, her heart,
   Then get what knowledge ear and eye
      Glean chancewise in the life-long mart.
   And certain others, few and fit,
      Attach them to the Court, and see
   The Country‚Äôs best, its accent hit,
      And partly sound its polity.


III.
_Disappointment_.


   ‚ÄòThe bliss which woman‚Äôs charms bespeak,
      I‚Äôve sought in many, found in none!‚Äô
   ‚ÄòIn many ‚Äôtis in vain you seek
      What only can be found in one.‚Äô


THE FRIENDS.

1


   Frank‚Äôs long, dull letter, lying by
      The gay sash from Honoria‚Äôs waist,
   Reproach‚Äôd me; passion spared a sigh
      For friendship without fault disgraced.
   How should I greet him? how pretend
      I felt the love he once inspired?
   Time was when either, in his friend,
      His own deserts with joy admired;
   We took one side in school-debate,
      Like hopes pursued with equal thirst,
   Were even-bracketed by Fate,
      Twin-Wranglers, seventh from the First;
   And either loved a lady‚Äôs laugh
      More than all music; he and I
   Were perfect in the pleasant half
      Of universal charity.


2


   From pride of likeness thus I loved
      Him, and he me, till love begot
   The lowliness which now approved
      Nothing but that which I was not,
   Blest was the pride of feeling so
      Subjected to a girl‚Äôs soft reign.
   She was my vanity, and, oh,
      All other vanities how vain!


3


   Frank follow‚Äôd in his letter‚Äôs track,
      And set my guilty heart at ease
   By echoing my excuses back
      With just the same apologies.
   So he had slighted me as well!
      Nor was my mind disburthen‚Äôd less
   When what I sought excuse to tell
      He of himself did first confess.


4


   Each, rapturous, praised his lady‚Äôs worth;
      He eloquently thus: ‚ÄòHer face
   Is the summ‚Äôd sweetness of the earth,
      Her soul the glass of heaven‚Äôs grace,
   To which she leads me by the hand;
      Or, briefly all the truth to say
   To you, who briefly understand,
      She is both heaven and the way.
   Displeasures and resentments pass
      Athwart her charitable eyes
   More fleetingly than breath from glass,
      Or truth from foolish memories;
   Her heart‚Äôs so touch‚Äôd with others‚Äô woes
      She has no need of chastisement;
   Her gentle life‚Äôs conditions close,
      Like God‚Äôs commandments, with content,
   And make an aspect calm and gay,
      Where sweet affections come and go,
   Till all who see her, smile and say,
      How fair, and happy that she‚Äôs so!
   She is so lovely, true, and pure,
      Her virtue virtue so endears,
   That often, when I think of her,
      Life‚Äôs meanness fills mine eyes with tears‚Äî‚Äô
   ‚ÄòYou paint Miss Churchill!  Pray go on‚Äî‚Äô
      ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs perfect, and, if joy was much
   To think her nature‚Äôs paragon,
      ‚ÄôTis more that there‚Äôs another such!‚Äô


5


   Praising and paying back their praise
      With rapturous hearts, t‚Äôward Sarum Spire
   We walk‚Äôd, in evening‚Äôs golden haze,
      Friendship from passion stealing fire.
   In joy‚Äôs crown danced the feather jest,
      And, parting by the Deanery door,
   Clasp‚Äôd hands, less shy than words, confess‚Äôd
      We had not been true friends before.



CANTO X.
The Epitaph.


PRELUDES.

I.
_Frost in Harvest_.


   THE lover who, across a gulf
      Of ceremony, views his Love,
   And dares not yet address herself,
      Pays worship to her stolen glove.
   The gulf o‚Äôerleapt, the lover wed,
      It happens oft, (let truth be told),
   The halo leaves the sacred head,
      Respect grows lax, and worship cold,
   And all love‚Äôs May-day promising,
      Like song of birds before they pair,
   Or flush of flowers in boastful Spring,
      Dies out, and leaves the Summer bare.
   Yet should a man, it seems to me,
      Honour what honourable is,
   For some more honourable plea
      Than only that it is not his.
   The gentle wife, who decks his board
      And makes his day to have no night,
   Whose wishes wait upon her lord,
      Who finds her own in his delight,
   Is she another now than she
      Who, mistress of her maiden charms,
   At his wild prayer, incredibly
      Committed them to his proud arms?
   Unless her choice of him‚Äôs a slur
      Which makes her proper credit dim,
   He never enough can honour her
      Who past all speech has honour‚Äôd him.


II.
_Felicity_.


   To marry her and take her home!
      The poet, painting pureness, tells
   Of lilies; figures power by Rome;
      And each thing shows by something else.
   But through the songs of poets look,
      And who so lucky to have found
   In universal nature‚Äôs book
      A likeness for a life so crown‚Äôd!
   Here they speak best who best express
      Their inability to speak,
   And none are strong, but who confess
      With happy skill that they are weak.


III.
_Marriage Indissoluble_.


   ‚ÄòIn heaven none marry.‚Äô  Grant the most
      Which may by this dark word be meant,
   Who shall forbid the eternal boast
      ‚ÄòI kiss‚Äôd, and kiss‚Äôd with her consent!‚Äô
   If here, to Love, past favour is
      A present boast, delight, and chain,
   What lacks of honour, bond, and bliss,
      Where Now and Then are no more twain!


THE EPITAPH.

1


   ‚ÄòAt Church, in twelve hours more, we meet!
      This, Dearest, is our last farewell.‚Äô
   ‚ÄòOh, Felix, do you love me?‚Äô  ‚ÄòSweet,
      Why do you ask?‚Äô  ‚ÄòI cannot tell.‚Äô


2


   And was it no vain fantasy
      That raised me from the earth with pride?
   Should I to-morrow verily
      Be Bridegroom, and Honoria Bride?
   Should I, in simple fact, henceforth
      Live unconditionally lord
   Of her whose smile for brightest worth
      Seem‚Äôd all too bountiful reward?
   Incredible life‚Äôs promise seem‚Äôd,
      Or, credible, for life too great;
   Love his own deity blasphemed,
      And doff‚Äôd at last his heavenly state.
   What law, if man could mount so high,
      To further insolence set bars,
   And kept the chaste moon in the sky,
      And bade him not tread out the stars!


3


   Patience and hope had parted truce,
      And, sun-like, Love obscured his ray
   With dazzling mists, driven up profuse
      Before his own triumphant way.
   I thought with prayer how Jacob paid
      The patient price of Rachel; them,
   Of that calm grace Tobias said,
      And Sarah‚Äôs innocent ‚ÄòAmen.‚Äô
   Without avail!  O‚Äôerwhelming wealth,
      The wondrous gift of God so near,
   Which should have been delight and health
      Made heart and spirit sick and sere.
   Until at last the soul of love,
      That recks not of its own delight,
   Awoke and bade the mists remove,
      And then once more I breathed aright;
   And I rehears‚Äôd my marriage vow,
      And swore her welfare to prefer
   To all things, and for aye as now
      To live, not for myself, but her.
   Forth, from the glittering spirit‚Äôs peace
      And gaiety ineffable,
   Stream‚Äôd to the heart delight and ease,
      As from an overflowing well;
   And, orderly deriving thence
      Its pleasure perfect and allow‚Äôd,
   Bright with the spirit shone the sense,
      As with the sun a fleecy cloud.
   If now to part with her could make
      Her pleasure greater, sorrow less,
   I for my epitaph would take
      ‚ÄòTo serve seem‚Äôd more than to possess.‚Äô
   And I perceiv‚Äôd, (the vision sweet
      Dimming with happy dew mine eyes),
   That love and joy are torches lit
      From altar-fires of sacrifice.


4


   Across the sky the daylight crept,
      And birds grew garrulous in the grove,
   And on my marriage-morn I slept
      A soft sleep, undisturb‚Äôd by love.



CANTO XI.
The Wedding.


PRELUDES.

I.
_Platonic Love_.


   RIGHT art thou who wouldst rather be
      A doorkeeper in Love‚Äôs fair house,
   Than lead the wretched revelry
      Where fools at swinish troughs carouse.
   But do not boast of being least;
      And if to kiss thy Mistress‚Äô skirt
   Amaze thy brain, scorn not the Priest
      Whom greater honours do not hurt.
   Stand off and gaze, if more than this
      Be more than thou canst understand,
   Revering him whose power of bliss,
      Angelic, dares to seize her hand,
   Or whose seraphic love makes flight
      To the apprehension of her lips;
   And think, the sun of such delight
      From thine own darkness takes eclipse.
   And, wouldst thou to the same aspire,
      This is the art thou must employ,
   Live greatly; so shalt thou acquire
      Unknown capacities of joy.


II.
_A Demonstration_.


   Nature, with endless being rife,
      Parts each thing into ‚Äòhim‚Äô and ‚Äòher,‚Äô
   And, in the arithmetic of life,
      The smallest unit is a pair;
   And thus, oh, strange, sweet half of me,
      If I confess a loftier flame,
   If more I love high Heaven than thee,
      I more than love thee, thine I am;
   And, if the world‚Äôs not built of lies,
      Nor all a cheat the Gospel tells,
   If that which from the dead shall rise
      Be I indeed, not something else,
   There‚Äôs no position more secure
      In reason or in faith than this,
   That those conditions must endure,
      Which, wanting, I myself should miss.


III.
_The Symbol_.


   As if I chafed the sparks from glass,
      And said, ‚ÄòIt lightens,‚Äô hitherto
   The songs I‚Äôve made of love may pass
      For all but for proportion true;
   But likeness and proportion both
      Now fail, as if a child in glee,
   Catching the flakes of the salt froth,
      Cried, ‚ÄòLook, my mother, here‚Äôs the sea.
   Yet, by the help of what‚Äôs so weak,
      But not diverse, to those who know,
   And only unto those I speak,
      May far-inferring fancy show
   Love‚Äôs living sea by coasts uncurb‚Äôd,
      Its depth, its mystery, and its might,
   Its indignation if disturb‚Äôd,
      The glittering peace of its delight.


IV.
_Constancy Rewarded_.


   I vow‚Äôd unvarying faith, and she,
      To whom in full I pay that vow,
   Rewards me with variety
      Which men who change can never know.


THE WEDDING.

1


   Life smitten with a feverish chill,
      The brain too tired to understand,
   In apathy of heart and will,
      I took the woman from the hand
   Of him who stood for God, and heard
      Of Christ, and of the Church his Bride;
   The Feast, by presence of the Lord
      And his first Wonder, beautified;
   The mystic sense to Christian men;
      The bonds in innocency made,
   And gravely to be enter‚Äôd then,
      For children, godliness, and, aid,
   And honour‚Äôd, and kept free from smirch;
      And how a man must love his wife
   No less than Christ did love his Church,
      If need be, giving her his life;
   And, vowing then the mutual vow,
      The tongue spoke, but intention slept.
   ‚ÄôTis well for us Heaven asks not how
      We take this oath, but how ‚Äôtis kept.


2


   O, bold seal of a bashful bound,
      Which makes the marriage-day to be,
   To those before it and beyond,
      An iceberg in an Indian sea!


3


   ‚ÄòNow, while she‚Äôs changing,‚Äô said the Dean,
      ‚ÄòHer bridal for her travelling dress,
   I‚Äôll preach allegiance to your queen!
      Preaching‚Äôs the thing which I profess;
   And one more minute‚Äôs mine!  You know
      I‚Äôve paid my girl a father‚Äôs debt,
   And this last charge is all I owe.
      She‚Äôs yours; but I love more than yet
   You can; such fondness only wakes
      When time has raised the heart above
   The prejudice of youth, which makes
      Beauty conditional to love.
   Prepare to meet the weak alarms
      Of novel nearness; recollect
   The eye which magnified her charms
      Is microscopic for defect.
   Fear comes at first; but soon, rejoiced,
      You‚Äôll find your strong and tender loves,
   Like holy rocks by Druids poised,
      The least force shakes, but none removes.
   Her strength is your esteem; beware
      Of finding fault; her will‚Äôs unnerv‚Äôd
   By blame; from you ‚Äôtwould be despair;
      But praise that is not quite deserv‚Äôd
   Will all her noble nature move
      To make your utmost wishes tree.
   Yet think, while mending thus your Love,
      Of snatching her ideal too.
   The death of nuptial joy is sloth:
      To keep your mistress in your wife,
   Keep to the very height your oath,
      And honour her with arduous life.
   Lastly, no personal reverence doff.
      Life‚Äôs all externals unto those
   Who pluck the blushing petals off,
      To find the secret of the rose.‚Äî
   How long she‚Äôs tarrying!  Green‚Äôs Hotel
      I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll like.  The charge is fair,
   The wines good.  I remember well
      I stay‚Äôd once, with her Mother, there.
   A tender conscience of her vow
      That Mother had!  She‚Äôs so like her!‚Äô
   But Mrs. Fife, much flurried, now
      Whisper‚Äôd, ‚ÄòMiss Honor‚Äôs ready, Sir.‚Äô


4


   Whirl‚Äôd off at last, for speech I sought,
      To keep shy Love in countenance,
   But, whilst I vainly tax‚Äôd my thought,
      Her voice deliver‚Äôd mime from trance:
   ‚ÄòLook, is not this a pretty shawl,
      Aunt‚Äôs parting gift.‚Äô  ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs always kind.‚Äô
   ‚ÄòThe new wing spoils Sir John‚Äôs old Hall:
      You‚Äôll see it, if you pull the blind.‚Äô


5


   I drew the silk: in heaven the night
      Was dawning; lovely Venus shone,
   In languishment of tearful light,
      Swathed by the red breath of the sun.

PRELUDES.

I.
_The Married Lover_.


   WHY, having won her, do I woo?
      Because her spirit‚Äôs vestal grace
   Provokes me always to pursue,
      But, spirit-like, eludes embrace;
   Because her womanhood is such
      That, as on court-days subjects kiss
   The Queen‚Äôs hand, yet so near a touch
      Affirms no mean familiarness,
   Nay, rather marks more fair the height
      Which can with safety so neglect
   To dread, as lower ladies might,
      That grace could meet with disrespect,
   Thus she with happy favour feeds
      Allegiance from a love so high
   That thence no false conceit proceeds
      Of difference bridged, or state put by;
   Because, although in act and word
      As lowly as a wife can be,
   Her manners, when they call me lord,
      Remind me ‚Äôtis by courtesy;
   Not with her least consent of will,
      Which would my proud affection hurt,
   But by the noble style that still
      Imputes an unattain‚Äôd desert;
   Because her gay and lofty brows,
      When all is won which hope can ask,
   Reflect a light of hopeless snows
      That bright in virgin ether bask;
   Because, though free of the outer court
      I am, this Temple keeps its shrine
   Sacred to Heaven; because, in short,
      She‚Äôs not and never can be mine.


II.
_The Amaranth_.


   Feasts satiate; stars distress with height;
      Friendship means well, but misses reach,
   And wearies in its best delight,
      Vex‚Äôd with the vanities of speech;
   Too long regarded, roses even
      Afflict the mind with fond unrest;
   And to converse direct within Heaven
      Is oft a labour in the breast;
   Whate‚Äôer the up-looking soul admires,
      Whate‚Äôer the senses‚Äô banquet be,
   Fatigues at last with vain desires,
      Or sickens by satiety;
   But truly my delight was more
      In her to whom I‚Äôm bound for aye
   Yesterday than the day before
      And more to-day than yesterday.


HUSBAND AND WIFE.

1


   I, while the shop-girl fitted on
      The sand-shoes, look‚Äôd where, down the bay,
   The sea glow‚Äôd with a shrouded sun.
      ‚ÄòI‚Äôm ready, Felix; will you pay?‚Äô
   That was my first expense for this
      Sweet Stranger, now my three days‚Äô Wife.
   How light the touches are that kiss
      The music from the chords of life!


2


   Her feet, by half-a-mile of sea,
      In spotless sand left shapely prints;
   With agates, then, she loaded me;
      (The lapidary call‚Äôd them flints);
   Then, at her wish, I hail‚Äôd a boat,
      To take her to the ships-of-war,
   At anchor, each a lazy mote
      Black in the brilliance, miles from shore.


3


   The morning breeze the canvas fill‚Äôd,
      Lifting us o‚Äôer the bright-ridged gulf,
   And every lurch my darling thrill‚Äôd
      With light fear smiling at itself;
   And, dashing past the Arrogant,
      Asleep upon the restless wave
   After its cruise in the Levant,
      We reach‚Äôd the Wolf, and signal gave
   For help to board; within caution meet,
      My bride was placed within the chair,
   The red flag wrapp‚Äôd about her feet,
      And so swung laughing through the air.


4


   ‚ÄòLook, Love,‚Äô she said, ‚Äòthere‚Äôs Frederick Graham,
      My cousin, whom you met, you know,‚Äô
   And seeing us, the brave man came,
      And made his frank and courteous bow,
   And gave my hand a sailor‚Äôs shake,
      And said, ‚ÄòYou ask‚Äôd me to the Hurst:
   I never thought my luck would make
      Your wife and you my guests the first.‚Äô
   And Honor, cruel, ‚ÄòNor did we:
      Have you not lately changed your ship?‚Äô
   ‚ÄòYes: I‚Äôm Commander, now,‚Äô said he,
      With a slight quiver of the lip.
   We saw the vessel, shown with pride;
      Took luncheon; I must eat his salt!
   Parting he said, (I fear my bride
      Found him unselfish to a fault),
   His wish, he saw, had come to pass,
      (And so, indeed, her face express‚Äôd),
   That that should be, whatever ‚Äôtwas,
      Which made his Cousin happiest.
   We left him looking from above;
      Rich bankrupt! for he could afford
   To say most proudly that his love
      Was virtue and its own reward.
   But others loved as well as he,
      (Thought I, half-anger‚Äôd), and if fate,
   Unfair, had only fashion‚Äôd me
      As hapless, I had been as great.


5


   As souls, ambitious, but low-born,
      If raised past hope by luck or wit,
   All pride of place will proudly scorn,
      And live as they‚Äôd been used to it,
   So we two wore our strange estate:
      Familiar, unaffected, free,
   We talk‚Äôd, until the dusk grew late,
      Of this and that; but, after tea,
   As doubtful if a lot so sweet
      As ours was ours in very sooth,
   Like children, to promote conceit,
      We feign‚Äôd that it was not the truth;
   And she assumed the maiden coy,
      And I adored remorseless charms,
   And then we clapp‚Äôd our hands for joy,
      And ran into each others arms.


THE EPILOGUE.

I


   ‚ÄòAH, dearest Wife, a fresh-lit fire
      Sends forth to heaven great shows of fume,
   And watchers, far away, admire;
      But when the flames their power assume,
   The more they burn the less they show,
      The clouds no longer smirch the sky,
   And then the flames intensest glow
      When far-off watchers think they die.
   The fumes of early love my verse
      Has figured‚Äî‚Äô  ‚ÄòYou must paint the flame!‚Äô
   ‚ÄôTwould merit the Promethean curse!
      But now, Sweet, for your praise and blame.‚Äô
   ‚ÄòYou speak too boldly; veils are due
      To women‚Äôs feelings.‚Äô  ‚ÄòFear not this!
   Women will vow I say not true,
      And men believe thine lips they kiss.‚Äô
   I did not call you ‚ÄúDear‚Äù or ‚ÄúLove,‚Äù
      ‚ÄòI think, till after Frank was born.‚Äô
   ‚ÄòThat fault I cannot well remove;
      The rhymes‚Äô‚Äîbut Frank now blew his horn,
   And Walter bark‚Äôd, on hands and knees,
      At Baby in the mignonette,
   And all made, full-cry, for the trees
      Where Felix and his Wife were set.
   Again disturb‚Äôd, (crickets have cares!)
      True to their annual use they rose,
   To offer thanks at Evening Prayers
      In three times sacred Sarum Close.


2


   Passing, they left a gift of wine
      At Widow Neale‚Äôs.  Her daughter said:
   ‚ÄòO, Ma‚Äôam, she‚Äôs sinking!  For a sign,
      She cried just now, of him that‚Äôs dead,
   ‚ÄúMary, he‚Äôs somewhere close above,
      Weeping and wailing his dead wife,
   With forceful prayers and fatal love
      Conjuring me to come to life.
   A spirit is terrible though dear!
      It comes by night, and sucks my breath,
   And draws me with desire and fear.‚Äù
      Ah, Ma‚Äôam, she‚Äôll soon be his in death!‚Äô


3


   Vaughan, when his kind Wife‚Äôs eyes were dry,
      Said, ‚ÄòThis thought crosses me, my Dove;
   If Heaven should proffer, when we die,
      Some unconceiv‚Äôd, superior love,
   How take the exchange without despair,
      Without worse folly how refuse?‚Äô
   But she, who, wise as she was fair,
      For subtle doubts had simple clues,
   Said, ‚ÄòCustom sanctifies, and faith
      Is more than joy: ah, how desire
   In any heaven a different path,
      Though, found at first, it had been higher?
   Yet love makes death a dreadful thought!
      Felix, at what a price we live!‚Äô
   But present pleasures soon forgot
      The future‚Äôs dread alternative;
   For, as became the festal time,
      He cheer‚Äôd her heart with tender praise,
   And speeches wanting only rhyme
      To make them like his winged lays.
   He discommended girlhood.  ‚ÄòWhat
      For sweetness like the ten-years‚Äô wife,
   Whose customary love is not
      Her passion, or her play, but life?
   With beauties so maturely fair,
      Affecting, mild, and manifold,
   May girlish charms mo more compare
      Than apples green with apples gold.
   Ah, still unpraised Honoria, Heaven,
      When you into my arms it gave,
   Left nought hereafter to be given
      But grace to feel the good I have.‚Äô


4


   Her own and manhood‚Äôs modesty
      Made dumb her love, but, on their road,
   His hand in hers felt soft reply,
      And like rejoinder found bestow‚Äôd;
   And, when the carriage set them down,
      ‚ÄòHow strange,‚Äô said he, ‚Äò‚Äôtwould seem to meet,
   When pacing, as we now this town,
      A Florence or a Lisbon Street,
   That Laura or that Catherine, who,
      In the remote, romantic years,
   From Petrarch or Camoens drew
      Their songs and their immortal tears!‚Äô
   But here their converse had its end;
      For, crossing the Cathedral Lawn,
   There came an ancient college-friend,
      Who, introduced to Mrs. Vaughan,
   Lifted his hat, and bow‚Äôd and smiled.
      And fill‚Äôd her kind large eyes with joy,
   By patting on the cheek her child,
      With, ‚ÄòIs he yours, this handsome boy?‚Äô

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
