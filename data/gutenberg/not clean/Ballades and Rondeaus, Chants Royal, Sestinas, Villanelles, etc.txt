_The crowning pleasure in the compilation of this book is the
permission to dedicate it to you, and this token of personal admiration
is not without special fitness, since you were among the earliest to
experiment in these French rhythms, and to introduce_ CHARLES D'ORLÉANS
_and_ FRANÇOIS VILLON _to the majority of English readers_.
_"Those old French ways of verse making that have been coming into
fashion of late. Surely they say a pretty thing more prettily for
their quaint old-fashioned liberty! That_ TRIOLET--_how deliciously
impertinent it is! is it not?... The variety of dainty modes wherein
by shape and sound a very pretty something is carved out of nothing at
all. Their fantastic surprises, the ring of their bell-like returns
upon themselves, their music of triangle and cymbal. In some of
them poetry seems to approach the nearest possible to bird-song--to
unconscious seeming through most unconscious art, imitating the
carelessness and impromptu of forms as old as the existence of birds,
and as new as every fresh individual joy in each new generation,
growing their own feathers, and singing their own song, yet always the
feathers of their kind, and the song of their kind."--_

This anthology is chosen entirely from poems written in the traditional
fixed forms of the _ballade_, _chant royal_, _kyrielle_, _rondel_,
_rondeau_, _rondeau redoublé_, _sestina_, _triolet_, _villanelle_, and
_virelai_, with the addition of the _pantoum_. That such a choice is
the result of circumstances it is needless to point out, since only
those that had found favour with English writers were available for
the purpose. So far as I know, this collection is the first of its
sort, although Mr. W. Davenport Adams' _Latter Day Lyrics_ included a
section chosen on the same lines. Having, in company, no doubt, with
many others, a genuine regard for the group Mr. Adams included there,
I had long hoped to see a more ample compilation of later work in
this school; but notwithstanding the steady increase in the number of
poems written in the forms systematically arranged herein, the ground
remained unoccupied, until the appearance of this book; which may
fairly claim to be the first in the field, since no other volume has
devoted its whole space to them, save in the rarer cases, where an
author has published a collection of original poems cast in one mould,
notably Mr. Swinburne's _Century of Roundels_ and Mr. Andrew Lang's
_Ballades in Blue China_.
In Mr. Adams' volume another valuable feature was the _Note on some
Foreign forms of Verse_ by Mr. Austin Dobson, which many years since
introduced to me the laws of the various forms and created my special
interest in them. It is no derogation to the charming group in the
former volume to say of the present collection, that it far exceeds its
predecessor in number and variety, for now there is a wide field to
choose from, whereas Mr. Adams was then limited to a selection from the
small number extant.
The rules which Mr. Austin Dobson was the first to formulate in English
are made the basis (side by side with the treatises of M. de Gramont,
M. de Banville, and other authorities) of the following chapter on the
rules of the various forms. Lest a name so intimately associated with
the introduction of the old French metrical shapes in English poetry
should appear to be brought in to add weight to my own attempt, and
the reputation of a master invoked for the work of one who at furthest
can but style himself an apprentice, I must ask that this necessary
tribute to Mr. Dobson's labours be taken only as an apology for so
freely using his material, and that his ready help is by no means to
be regarded in the faintest way as an imprimatur of any statements in
this prefatory matter, save those quoted avowedly and directly from his
writings.
It may be best to name at once the authorities who have been consulted
in the preparation of the introductory chapter. These include the
French treatises of De Banville, De Gramont, and Jullienne, Mr.
Saintsbury's _Short History of French Literature_, Mr. Hueffers'
_Troubadours_, an article by Mr. Gosse in the _Cornhill Magazine_,
July 1877, _Les Villanelles_ by M. Joseph Boulmier, _The Rhymester_ of
Mr. Brander Matthews, and many occasional papers on the various forms
that have appeared in English and American periodicals. To arrange in
one chapter the materials gathered from these and other sources is all
that I have attempted. If at times the need to crowd enough matter for
a volume into the limits of a few pages results in a want of lucidity,
I must plead the necessity imposed by limited space. To those who, by
their kindly permission, have allowed their poems to be quoted here,
the thanks that I can offer are as hearty as the expression of my
gratitude is brief. The somewhat onerous task of obtaining consent
from about two hundred authors has been turned to a pleasure, by the
evidence of interest taken in this, the first collection of the later
growth of this branch of poetic art. Nor did the help cease with the
loan of the poems; in many instances a correspondence followed that
brought to light fresh material, both for the body of the book and the
introductory chapter, and rendered assistance not easy to overvalue.
If any writer is quoted without direct permission, it was through
no want of effort to trace him, excepting in the case of a very few
that reached me in the shape of newspaper cuttings, wholly devoid of
any clue to the locality of the writer. To Mr. Austin Dobson my best
thanks are due. From Mr. Andrew Lang and Mr. Edmund Gosse I have also
appropriated material, acknowledged as often as practicable; also to
my friend, Mr. A. G. Wright, for invaluable help during the rather
monotonous task of hunting up and copying at the reading-room of the
British Museum; and to Mr. William Sharp, whose critical advice and
generous encouragement throughout have left a debt of gratitude beyond
payment.
In a society paper, _The London_, a brilliant series of these poems
appeared during 1877-8. After a selection was made for this volume, it
was discovered that they were all by _one_ author, Mr. W. E. Henley,
who most generously permitted the whole of those chosen to appear,
and to be for the first time publicly attributed to him. The poems
themselves need no apology, but in the face of so many from his pen,
it is only right to explain the reason for the inclusion of so large a
number.
From America Mr. Brander Matthews and Mr. Clinton Scollard have shown
sympathy with the collection, not only by permitting their works to
be cited, but also by calling my attention to poems by authors almost
unknown in England; while all those writers who in the new world are
using the old shapes with a peculiar freshness and vigour, gave ready
assent to the demand.
To Messrs. Cassell & Co., for allowing poems that appeared in
_Cassell's Family Magazine_ (those by Miss Ada Louise Martin and Mr.
G. Weatherley); to Messrs. Longman, for liberty to quote freely from
the many graceful examples that appeared in _Longman's Magazine_; to
Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, & Co., for endorsing Mr. Andrew Lang's
permission to include specimens from _Rhymes à la Mode_ and _Ballades
in Blue China_, the utmost thanks are due for the courtesy shown;
also to the proprietors of the _Century Magazine_, where so many of
the American poems (many since collected by the authors in their own
volumes) first appeared; and to Messrs Harper for permission to use
Mr. Coleman's _Sestina_, and Mr. Graham R. Tomson's _Ballade of the
Bourne_, which first appeared in their popular monthly. The poems that
are cited by the courtesy of Mr. John Payne appear respectively in
_Songs of Life and Death_ (W. H. Allen & Co.), _New Poems_ (ditto), and
_Poems by François Villon_ (Reeves & Turner), now out of print.
Having named so many who have lent aid, it is but fair to exonerate
them from any blame for errors that, no doubt, in spite of the utmost
care, may have crept in. In view of a later edition, I should be
glad to be informed of any additional data of the use of the forms
in English verse, which, if quoted, would add to the value of the
collection, or to have any erroneous statements corrected.
Notwithstanding the many shortcomings of my own share in the production
of this volume, I cannot doubt but that the charm of the poems
themselves will endear it to readers; and as a lover of the "Gallic
bonds," I venture to hope it may do some little towards their complete
naturalisation in our tongue.
_August 1887._
In the limited space available, it is hardly possible to give more than
a very crude sketch of the origin of these forms; but some reference
to early Provençal literature is inevitable, since the nucleus of
not a few of them can be traced among the intricate rhyming of the
Troubadours. Yet it would be beyond the purpose to go minutely into the
enticing history of that remarkable period, nor is it needful to raise
disputed questions regarding the origin of each particular fashion. The
number of books on Provençal subjects is great, the mere enumeration
of the names of those in the library of the British Museum would fill
several pages. The language itself has a fascination which allures
many to disaster, for as Mr. Hueffer points out, it "looks at first
sight so like the Latin and more familiar Romance languages that it
offers special temptations" to guess at its meaning, with very doubtful
success.
The term Provençal is usually applied to a dialect more correctly
known as "the Langue d'Oc, which, with the Langue d'Oil, forms the two
divisions of the Romance language spoken in the country we now know as
France;" but Mr. Saintsbury remarks that, strictly speaking, the Langue
d'Oc should not be called "French" at all, since it is hardly more akin
to the Langue d'Oil than it is to Spanish and Italian, and that those
who spoke it applied the term "French" to northern speech, calling
their own Limousin, or Provençal, or Auvergnat. The limits where it
prevailed extended far beyond Provence itself. Authorities differ
with regard to the exact boundaries. It will suffice for the present
purpose to take those Mr. Hueffer adopts--namely, the district within a
boundary formed by a line drawn from the mouth of the Gironde to that
of the Saone, in the north, while the southern limit includes parts of
Spain, such as Aragon, Valencia, Catalonia, and the Balearic Islands.
Herr Karl Bartsch, the eminent historian of Provençal literature,
divides it into three periods:--the first, to the end of the eleventh
century; the second, which is the one that marks the most flourishing
time of the poetry of the Troubadours, extending over the twelfth and
thirteenth; and the third period--of its decadence--in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries. To this may be added the attempt to revive
it in our own day, by the school of the so-called _Félibres_,
including Mistral, Aubanel, Alphonse Daudet, and others, who have
worked vigorously, and with no mean success, to produce a modern
literature in the old dialect, worthy of its former dignity. In this
preface it is impossible to mention any part of the prose of this
marvellous literature, which sprang almost suddenly into a gigantic
growth, that has been a fruitful theme for wonder and admiration ever
since, and left its influence widely felt. The point that is to the
purpose here, concerns the invention by the Provençal poets of many
set forms of verse, some few of which are still written, but most
so altered and renewed by later use, that their original character
is well-nigh obscured. The forms included in this book are often
erroneously attributed _en masse_ to the _jongleurs_ of Provence, yet
few assumptions are less true. Altered by the Trouvères, the fifteenth
century poets, the Ronsardists, and later writers, it is safer to
assign to the Troubadours only the germs which evolved gradually into
their now matured forms. To linger over the extraordinary period is
a temptation hard to dismiss; the very name still has a flavour of
romance, and brings a curious medley of images to the mind when it is
heard, many perhaps as far from the actual Provençal Troubadour as
_Nanki-Poo_ in the "_Mikado_" is from the wandering minstrel of the
court of King Thibaut. Of the Troubadours who have come down to fame,
four hundred and sixty are recorded by name, besides two hundred and
fifty-one pieces that have survived without evidence of their authors.
King Richard I. (our own Coeur de Lion), Guillem de Cabestanh, Peire
Vidal, Bertran de Born, The Monk of Montaudon, and many others, have
biographical sketches of exceeding interest allotted to them in Mr.
Hueffer's "The Troubadours." A halo of romance has gathered round
their names, and thrown a glamour over the record of their lives; to
read their history is to be transported to a region where all topics
but love and song are deemed unimportant trifles, unless the old
chroniclers are singularly untruthful in their statements. We know
now-a-days many a young poet's crushed life appears only in his verses,
and outside those he appears but an average Philistine to vulgar eyes.
Perhaps the "land of the nightingale and rose" was not so idyllic as
its historians paint it; but with every deduction, there yet remains
evidence of an exceptional importance attached to the arts, more
especially to that of song. To those who wrote, or rather sang, witty
impromptus (made often, we can but fancy, with much labour beforehand),
or produced dainty conceits in elaborate rhymes and rhythms, when
sound came perilously near triumphing over sense, a welcome was
extended, as widespread and far more personal in its application than
even that accorded to our modern substitute for the troubadour--the
popular novelist. The doings of the Courts of Love, set down in sober
chronicles, are hardly less fantastic than Mr. Gilbert's ingenious
operas. Matters of the most sentimental and amorous character were
debated in public, with all the earnestness of a question of state.
That their poetry was singularly limited in its character there is
little doubt, but Mr. Hueffer declares that it had its serious side,
often lost sight of, and that no small portion was devoted to stately
and dignified subjects. Mr. Lowell, on the other hand, in an essay on
Chaucer in _My Study Windows_, says--
"Their poetry is purely lyric in its most narrow sense, that is,
the expression of personal and momentary moods. To the fancy of
the critics who take their cue from tradition, Provence is a
morning sky of early summer, out of which innumerable larks rain a
faint melody (the sweeter because rather half divined than heard
too distinctly) over an earth where the dew never dries and the
flowers never fade. But when we open Raynouard it is like opening
the door of an aviary. We are deafened and confused by a hundred
minstrels singing the same song at once, and more than suspect the
flowers they welcome are made of French cambric, spangled with
dewdrops of prevaricating glass."
The forms in which the Provençal poets wrote were chiefly these:--The
oldest was called _vers_, and consisted of octosyllabic lines arranged
in stanzas; from this grew the _canzo_, with interlaced rhymes--later
on with the distinctive feature still prominent in French, but
unknown in English poetry, the rhymes _masculine_ and _feminine_.
The _canzo_ was used entirely for subjects of love and gallantry,
but the _sirvente_, composed of short stanzas, simply rhyming, and
corresponding one to the other, was employed for political and social
subjects, sometimes treated seriously, at others satirically. The
_tenso_ was a curious trial of skill in impromptu versification. Two
antagonists met and agreed that the one should reply on the opposite
side to any argument the first might select. The opening stanza,
chosen at will by the speaker, was imitated in the reply, both in
observance of its rhyme and rhythm, the same rhyme-sound being often
kept throughout the whole poem. It must not be forgotten that the
Langue d'Oc was singularly fertile in rhymes, so that the feat was less
arduous than it would be in other tongues. The _alba_, a farewell at
morning, and the _serena_, or evening song, the _pastorella_, devoted,
as its name implies, to pastoral subjects, appear to govern the themes
of the verses rather than the form. There is record, however, of the
_breu-doble_ (double short), invented by Guirant Riquier, a little
form with three rhymes, two of which are repeated twice in three
four-lined stanzas, and given once in a concluding couplet, while the
third finished each quatrain. The _retroensa_ is noticeable for its
refrain of more than one line. The sonnet has ceased to be claimed
as a Provençal invention, yet it must be noted, as at one time its
origin there was a favourite theory. The _ballade_, "a song serving
to accompany the dance," must not be confused with the later ballade;
and lastly, the greatest in most respects, the _sestina_, which, as
it occurs among the poems noticed technically later on, need not be
further mentioned here.
"The artificial verse-forms of Provence include some as peculiar and
arbitrary as ever issued from the brain of Persian poet--verse-forms
by the side of which the metrical glitter of _ballade_, _chant royal_,
_rondeau_, _rondel_, _triolet_, _virelai_ and _villanelle_ must pale,"
says a writer in the _Westminster Review_ (October 1878), and instances
the _tenso_ and the _sestina_ in proof of his assertion. Mr. Hueffer
also treats the _chant royal_ as mere child's play beside the intricate
feats displayed by the Troubadours. The above short list shows many
examples of forms using the refrain and some other features preserved
in Northern poetry; but the debt owed by the North to the Troubadours
is far less, according to later writers, than that assigned to
Provençal influence some few years ago. Mr. Saintsbury says that "poems
called _rondeaux_ and _ballades_, of loose construction and undecided
form, began to make their appearance at the end of the twelfth and
beginning of the thirteenth century," but the forms as we know them
owe their present shape to their reformation in Northern France,
culminating in the poems of Charles d'Orléans and François Villon.
In this revival, the _lai_ and _pastourelle_ kept their Provençal
titles, but were made much more exact in form, and never attained the
widespread celebrity of the newer shapes, which are to all intents and
purposes the models for the forms in this volume, save the _sestina_,
which is practically an Italian, and the _pantoum_, an Eastern form.
There is no space here to notice more than the names of a few of even
the most prominent of the poets who succeeded the Provençal singers
in their use of these forms. There are thousands of ballades in MSS.
in the Royal French Library, by known and unknown writers. Eustache
Deschamps (1328-1415), a friend of Chaucer's, "has left no less than
numbers from his pen; also an important _Art of Poetry_, a treatise
rendered at once necessary and popular by the fashion of artificial
name of Jehan Froissart (1337-1410), the chronicler. Messire Guy de
la Tremouille, according to Mr. Gosse, is supposed to have been the
first to devise the elaborate rules of construction of the ballade,
which have been in force ever since. He was guard of the Oriflamme in
honour. That he cultivated the form we know, besides writing an "Art of
making Chansons, Ballades, Virelais, and Rondels," which is a valuable
relic of his time. Jehannot de Lescurel, "of whom absolutely nothing
is known, has left sixteen ballades, fifteen rondeaus (not in regular
form), and other pieces, said to be 'of singular grace, lightness, and
elegance.'"
Guillaume de Machault (1284-1377) was also a voluminous writer. One of
his poems, a _chanson balladée_, is printed in Mr. Saintsbury's _Short
History of French Literature_, which contains also a _Ballade_ by Alain
Chartier (1390-1458), the hero of the famous story of the kiss of Queen
Margaret of Scotland, and other specimens of this period, in a succinct
and trustworthy account of the growth of French poetry, surpassed by no
book in our own language.
Charles d'Orléans (1391-1466), noticed among the English writers,
is specially honoured as the master of the rondel; while François
Villon (1431-1485) stands out as the "prince of all ballade-makers."
For brief, but splendid sketches of these two, Mr. R. L. Stevenson's
_Familiar Studies of Men and Books_ should be consulted, while for
more prosaic description there is no lack of data. Since the revival
of interest in Villon, France has done tardy but unstinted honour to
her most famous poet, as it is the fashion just now to style him, but
there is a doubt whether the praise given is not in danger of being
exaggerated. Yet, making all allowances, there is vital humanity in his
wondrous writings, that now, after four hundred years, read as living
and modern in their presentation of life, as though they were by a
realist of our own day. In Villon, student, poet, housebreaker, we
find the forerunner of the Zola of to-day--one who, in so eminently an
artificial form as the ballade, cast aside all conventional restraints,
and sang of what he saw and knew. It is much to be regretted that
space forbids more translations of his poems to be included in this
collection. For those who wish to tackle him in his old, and by no
means easy, French, a good edition is published for a franc, in the
_Collection Jannet-Picard (Paris)_. Mr. Payne has translated the whole
of his authentic works into English in a volume, at present out of
print, which contains also a very graphic and full biography of this
remarkable man. Space forbids insertion of the sketch of his life
prepared for this chapter. Born in 1431, student 1448, B.A. in 1452,
writing his _Lesser Testament_ in 1446, his _Greater Testament_ in
truly, more infamy, than a whole generation of lesser poets. He was
condemned to die--he wrote his marvellous _Ballade of the Gibbet_ while
lying under sentence of death--but escaped. Where he died is unknown,
the date of his _Greater Testament_ being the last record of Master
François Villon of Paris.
In 1493 appeared _L'art et science de rhéthorique pour faire rigmes et
ballades_, by Henry de Croï--an invaluable treatise on French Poetics.
The works of Pierre Gringoire (1478-1544) must be named, if only for
the fact of De Banville's splendid ballade in his comedy "Gringoire,"
founded on an incident in the poet's life. By Mr. Lang's permission a
translation is quoted in the body of this volume. Mr. John Payne also
englished it, in the _Dublin University Magazine_, 1879. The works of
Clement Marot (1497-1544) demand special note, since his _ballades_ and
_chants royaux_ are now accepted as the ideal models for imitation.
In his _Art Poëtique_, 1555, Thomas Sibilet reviews many of the
former writers, and gives the rules of the poetry then in force.
Immediately after this date came another change; with the famous
school of Ronsard (1524-1585) and the _Pléiade_, as they are styled,
one of whom, however, Du Bellay, was eager to abolish the _ballade_
and _chant royal_ in favour of the _sonnet_. The members of this group
produced some notable work in strict forms. Among the Ronsardists we
find Grévin the dramatist, who wrote some graceful poems which he
called _Villanesques_--a modified form of the _Villanelle_--and Jean
Passerat (1534-1602) who is specially noteworthy, since in his hand the
_Villanelle_ crystallised into its present shape, Joseph Boulmier, in
the last revival, making this form his special study, and writing all
his verses after Passerat's model given elsewhere in this volume.
The rondeau was revived in great splendour in the middle of the
seventeenth century. Foremost among the brilliant group is Voiture
(1598-1648), the acknowledged master of this form. Only thirty of
his rondeaus are left, but each one of these is a masterpiece, and
may be studied for all the subtle devices and dainty inventions that
the form has yet yielded. Benserade (1612-1691) and Sarrasin were
also famous for rondeau-making, the former translating the whole of
Ovid's _Metamorphoses_ into rondeaus, which were sumptuously printed
at the King's Press at a cost of 10,000 francs. When Voiture died in
poem--possibly the most funny serious elegy ever composed--in which,
among other strange mourners, he makes the 'poor little triolet,' all
in tears, trot by the side of the dead poet," who, according to Mr.
Gosse, from whom the above paragraph is quoted, had never written one
in his life. Sarrasin also left a curious specimen of the _Glose_,
written on the famous Sonnet "de IOB" by Benserade. In 1649 Gérard de
Saint Amant wrote a volume of sixty-four triolets. From the seventeenth
to the nineteenth century no important examples occur. About thirty
years ago De Banville revived these old shapes, and initiated a
movement that Daudet, Glatigny, Boulmier, and a host of others have
helped forward, so that now modern French literature is flooded with
examples of the forms-the ballade, rondeau, and triolet being the most
widely used.
Having imperfectly followed the growth of the forms in France, it
will be interesting to give a few notes of the various attempts made
to acclimatise some in England. Although no effort previous to 1873
warrants us in claiming an English pedigree for them, yet it is
curious to see how often the attempt was made to write them in our own
tongue. The sonnet gradually grew into use, until it became as little
an exotic as the potato, to employ an uncouth simile; the ballade and
rondeau--hardly more formal in their rules, and with susceptibilities
of infinite grace and beauty--failed to be even residents amongst
us, much less naturalised subjects, sharing the rights and duties of
citizens. Chaucer is believed to have used these forms, as in "The
Legend of Good Women" he says, speaking of himself--
"Many a himpne for your holy daies
That highten balades, roundels, virelaies."
His "Balade de Vilage sauns Peynture," however, does not correspond
with the accepted form. Mr. Gosse says that the Chaucer of 1651
contains a number of poems attributed to himself and Lydgate "which
are merely pieces in rhyme-royal, so arranged as to imitate the French
ballade: without its severity of form."
The following is a roundel attributed to Chaucer:--
So hath your beauty fro your hertè chased
Pitee, that mee availeth not to pleyne;
Giltles my deth thus have ye purchased,
I sey you soth, me nedeth not to fayne;
So hath, etc.
Alas, that Nature hath in you compassed
So grete beaute, that no man may atteyne
So hath, etc.

and is especially interesting in connection with the history of the
forms in English use.
Of his immediate followers, Lydgate, a monk of Bury, author of _London
Lyckpenny_, is said by Guest to have written a "roundle," and one by
Thomas Occleve is printed in Morley's _Shorter English Poems_.
John Gower (1340-1408), author of _Confessio Amantis_, at the
coronation of Henry IV. presented the king with a collection of fifty
_Ballades_, written in the Provençal manner, "to entertain his noble
court." The thin oblong MS., on vellum, which contains them is still
extant in the Marquis of Stafford's library at Trentham, and in 1818 it
was printed for the Roxburghe Club; but as the poems are unfortunately
written in French, they do not assist in supporting a claim for the
early use of the form in England. Professor Henry Morley has translated
one for his _English Writers_; it follows the rhymes accurately, but
has a somewhat trite subject. A critic has well said of it, that the
poets of Gowers's day "were not burdened with solving 'the riddle of
the painful earth.' It may be that a good deal of their guileless
delight in things fresh and young was feigned, but then so is much
of our more pretentious philosophy." From its special interest it is
quoted here--
Winter departs, and comes the flowery May,
And round from cold to heat the seasons fly;
The bird that to its nest had lost the way
Rebuilds it that he may rejoice thereby.
Like change in my love's world I now descry,
With such a hope I comfort myself here,
And you, my lady, on this truth rely:
When grief departs the coming joys are near.
My lady sweet, by that which now I say
You may discover how my heart leaps high,
That serves you, and has served you many a day,
As it will serve you daily till I die.
Remember, then, my lady, knowing why,
That my desire for you will never veer
As God wills that it be, so be our tie:
When grief departs the coming joys are near.
The day that news of you came where I lay,
It seem'd there was no grief could make me sigh;
Wherefore of you, dear lady mine, I pray
By your own message--when you will, not I--
Send me what you think best as a reply
Wherewith my heart can keep itself from fear;
And, lady, search the reason of my cry--
When grief departs the coming joys are near.
_Envoy._
O noble Dame, to you this note shall hie,
And when God wills I follow to my dear.
This writing speaks, and says, till I am by,
When grief departs the coming joys are near.
John Shirley, who lived about 1440, made a collection of _Ballades_,
_Roundels_, _Virelais_, and Tragedies, in MSS., which are still
extant in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. After noticing Gower, who
wrote ballades in French, Charles d'Orléans, who wrote rondels in
English, comes as another instance of the early use, but again as a
mere exception, since the accident which led both writers to adopt
exotic forms is outside the history of our native poetry, and cannot
be brought forward to prove their early naturalisation. Of Charles
d'Orléans much might be said worth saying, but there are so many
sources of information open, that here we need note only the poems
written during his captivity. He is said to have been our prisoner for
about twenty-five years, and during that time to have acquired a taste
for our language. The Abbé Sallier, who unearthed the manuscript of
his poems in the Royal Library at Paris during the last century, says
he wrote but two in English; but in the MS. at the British Museum,
the Rev. H. F. Cary, the translator of Dante, found three, quoted in
his _Early French Poets_ (Bohn, 1846). The editor of that volume, the
Rev. Henry Cary, son of the author, mentions in a footnote a large
collection among the Harleian MSS., attributed to Charles d'Orléans,
but throws doubt on their being more than translations. Into this
question there is no space to enter. These are the three from Cary's
book:--
Go forth, my hert, with my lady;
Loke that ye spar no bysines
To serve her with such lolyness
That ye gette her oftyme prively
That she kepe truly her promes.
Go forth, etc.
Abyde alone in hevynes;
And ye that dwell with your mastris
In plaisaunce glad and mery,
Go forth, etc.
My hertly love is in your governas,
And ever shall whill that I live may.
I pray to God I may see that day
That ye be knyt with trouthful alyans.
Ye shall not fynd feyning or variaunce
As in my part; that wyl I truly say.
My hertly, etc.
Bewere, my trewe innocent hert,
How ye hold with her aliauns,
That somtym with word of plesuns
Resceyved you under covert.
Without warnyng or deffiauns.
Bewere, my, etc.
And ye shall pryvely or appert
See her by me in loves dauns,
With her faire femenyn contenauns
Ye shall never fro her astert.
Bewere, my, etc.
Spenser (1553-1599) is said (but I cannot trace the authority) to have
used some of these forms. Again, Sir Philip Sidney's (1554-1586) famous
ditty, "My true love hath my heart," recalls the rondel, but cannot
claim to be one. Drummond of Hawthornden (1585-1649) has a fine sestina
(too long for quotation), "Sith gone is my delight and only pleasure."
_The Trivial Poems, and Triolets_ of Patrick Carey deserve mention.
This volume was unknown until the beginning of the present century,
although dated Warnefurd, 1651. The poems were brought into notice by
Sir Walter Scott, who obtained the MSS. from John Murray, and after
inserting a few in the _Edinburgh Annual Register_, 1810, published the
whole for the first time in 1819. The following specimen is taken from
Scott's reprint, p. 43:--
Worldly designes, feares, hopes, farwell!
Farwell all earthly joyes and cares!
On nobler thoughts my soule shall dwell
Worldly designes, feares, hopes, farwell!
Att quiett, in my peacefull cell,
I'le thincke on God, free from your snares;
Worldly designes, feares, hopes, farwell!
Farwell all earthly joyes and cares.
In the _Athenæum_, May 7, 1887, is a long article on Carey, signed C.
F. S. Warner, M. A. Charles Cotton, the friend of Izaak Walton, wrote
a rondeau, "a very ungallant example," cited in Dr. Guests' _History
of English Rhythms_. There is also one unquotable, by reason of its
subject, among the correspondence of Alexander Pope (1688-1744), and
in the _Rolliad_, 1784, a volume of satires in prose and verse, that
enjoyed a great popularity for a time, there is a set of five rondeaus,
written in pure form after the Voiture model. They satirise North,
Eden, Pitt, and Dorset, and are perfect in construction, and vigorous
in their ridicule. The popularity of these effusions led to many
imitations in the periodical prints at the beginning of this century,
few, however, of sufficient merit to be worth reviving. By the courtesy
of Mr. Austin Dobson, the owner, I am able to extract a specimen from a
scarce and little-known book, entitled _Rondeaulx; translated from the
Black Letter French Edition of 1527, by J. R. Best, Esq._;--
#Rondeaulx en Nombre trois cens cinquante.#
#Singuliers et a tous propos. Nouvellement#
#Imprimez a Paris. Avec Privelege#
#On les vend en la grant salle du palays au#
#Premier pillier en la boutique de Galliot du#
#Pre marchaut librarie jure de L'universite.#
The dedication to Robert Studley Vidal, Esq., is dated 1838. The first
poem is preceded by a quaint apology, that unfortunately is too long
to quote, but the rondeau itself, if its rhythm is faulty and its
language ungraceful, shows that the original had sterling advice to
offer, and that the translator was not ignorant of the true rules of
the form.
A good rondeau I was induced to show
To some fair ladies some short while ago;
Well knowing their ability and taste,
I asked, should ought be added or effac'd,
And prayed that every fault they'd make me know
The first did her most anxious care bestow
To impress one point from which I ne'er should go:
"Upon a good beginning must be based
A good rondeau."
Zeal bid the other's choicest language glow:
She softly said, "Recount your weal or woe,
Your every subject free from pause or haste:
Ne'er let your hero fail, nor be disgraced."
The third--"With varying emphasis should flow
A good rondeau."
In Mr. Oxenford's _Book of French Songs_, now published with Miss
Costello's _Specimens of the Early Poetry of France_, in a volume of
the _Chandos Classics_, there is one ballade given (with its original
French, both without envoy); but although noting the peculiarity that
each stanza has the same terminations, Mr. Oxenford has not kept it
in his translation, nor has Miss Costello, in a numerous collection
of ballades, rondels, lais, and other forms, once paraphrased them
accurately, usually varying even the refrain; nor can I see, in her
voluminous notes, that she draws attention to this important feature,
although she gives the particulars of the eccentricities of rhyming
known as _Fraternisée, Brisée_, and the like, and condemns their
triviality rather strongly. In the edition before me no date is given;
the authoress died in 1870. The oft-quoted Rondeau by Leigh Hunt is so
beautiful in itself that all its shortcomings in the matter of form
may be readily pardoned, and if--but the saving clause is great--others
as beautiful could be built on the same shape, a "Leigh Hunt" variation
would be a welcome addition to the forms in English; but it is no
_rondeau_, and has not the faintest claim to be so styled. Probably it
is familiar to all readers, but in case even one should not know it, it
is quoted here:--
"Jenny kissed me when we met,
Jumping from the chair she sat in.
Time, you thief, who love to get
Sweets upon your list, put that in!
Say I'm weary, say I'm sad;
Say that health and wealth have missed me;
Say I'm growing old, but add--
Jenny kissed me."
If Mr. Swinburne's examples of the forms in his earlier volumes be not
counted (since he then ignored many of the rules that, as his later
books show, he can use with such splendid mastery), to Mr. Andrew
Lang's _Lays and Lyrics of Old France_ (Longman, 1872) must be assigned
the honour of leading the way in the reproduction in English of the old
French metrical forms, made in conformance to their ascertained laws.
How far that volume led the way to the modern employment of these forms
for original poetry in our own tongue, is not so easily proved. One
thing, at least, is certain, that Mr. Austin Dobson, Mr. Edmund Gosse,
Mr. W. E. Henley, Mr. Payne, and one or two other writers, were each,
unknown to the rest, trying the new measures. In the words of one of
these, "the study of French literature was in the air;" and naturally,
as we now see, the new movement began simultaneously to adapt its rules
to English conditions. To Mr. Bridges belongs the honour of printing
the first Triolet in modern English; but he expressly disclaims being
looked upon as the apostle for the naturalisation of the exotic forms,
for which he had no peculiar sympathy, and after his _Poems_, 1873,
ceased to use. So little were his experiments appreciated, that their
presence in his volume was considered prejudicial to its success,
by competent authorities of the day, who little foresaw the rapid
growth that would so soon spring up. To Mr. Austin Dobson is assigned
the first _ballade_, "The Prodigals;" to Mr. Edmund Gosse the first
_villanelle_ and _chant royal_; and to Mr. W. E. Henley the first
_double ballade_, and a few other variations. But it is most likely
that the priority of some of these was due to the mere accident of
publication, and that it is more near the truth to regard the whole
as a contemporaneous movement toward French rhythms, thought out and
experimented upon by many writers, ignorant of the fact that they were
not alone in the study, and that others were working upon the same
lines. One of the first who made trial of these French rhythms has (I
believe) never published any; yet examples of their use by the author
of _A Child's Garden of Verse_ would have added greatly to the interest
of this collection, but the author has willed that they should remain
unquoted, so I can only regret their absence.
From 1873 to 1877 a fair number had appeared, but these were produced
almost entirely by the writers already named. From 1877, however, the
number of those who made them increased rapidly. In that year Mr.
Dobson's _Proverbs in Porcelain_ was published, containing a series of
these forms, which, as internal evidence of much subsequent work shows,
have been accepted as typical models to be followed in their English
use. The series in _The London_ noticed elsewhere, during this year and
be traced to some extent by the examples here collected. In America
about the same time the new fashion in versemaking was taken up very
warmly, and to the present day the Americans have shown themselves more
cordial towards the Gallic measures than even our own countrymen. In
the popular periodicals of the United States there are more specimens
than in our English magazines, and the appearance of so many examples
in this book shows that the American poets have caught a great deal of
the peculiar quality, hard to define but easy to recognise, which the
forms demand. Then came Mr. W. Davenport Adams's _Latter Day Lyrics_,
with a section devoted to these forms, and "A Note on Some Foreign
Forms of Verse," by Mr. Dobson. Since then the poems written in these
styles have been increasing in number, until the idea of collecting
them in one volume, long in my mind, was favourably entertained by Mr.
William Sharp, the general editor of the series in which this book
appears.
The taste for these _tours de force_ in the art of versemaking is
no doubt an acquired one; yet to quote the first attempt to produce
a lyric with a repeated burden would take one back to the earliest
civilisation. The use of the refrain and conventional arrangement of
rhyme in these forms differs as widely from the burdens of the old
examples, as the purely conventional design of Greek art from the
savage patterns of its ancestral stock. Whether the first refrains
were used for decorative effect only, or to give the singer time to
recollect or to improvise the next verse, it matters little, since
the once mere adjunct was made in later French use an integral and
vital part of the verse. The charm of these strictly written verses
is undoubtedly increased by some knowledge of their technical rules.
As a subtle harmony of colours may reveal, to those who can grasp
it, a miracle of skill and science, while it is no more nor less
than "a pretty picture" to others--or polyphonic harmony, with all
the resources of the science of music, may be employed to enrich a
clear popular melody, to which the unmusical can yet nod their heads
and fancy they understand it all; so a ballade or rondeau may be so
deftly wrought, with an infinity of care and grace, that those who
read it simply as a dainty poem never suspect the stern laws ordering
the apparent spontaneity of the whole. To approach ideal perfection,
nothing less than implicit obedience to all the rules is the first
element of success; but the task is by no means finished there. Every
quality that poetry demands, whether clearness of thought, elegance of
expression, harmonious sound, or faultless rhythm, is needed as much
in these shapes as in unfettered verse, and not until all those are
contributed comes the final test of the poem itself; whether it utters
thoughts worth uttering, or suggests ideas worth recalling. It may be
said, without fear of exaggeration, that all the qualities required to
form a perfect lyric in poetry are equally needful here, _plus_ a great
many special ones the forms themselves demand. To the students of any
art there is always a peculiar charm when the highest difficulties are
surmounted with such ease, that the consummate art is hidden to all
who know not the magic password to unveil it. But for those who have
no special knowledge of poetry, it is pertinent to inquire what good
these ingenious _tours de force_ achieve, and why the poem could not
please as well if it was written in ordinary verse? This is hard to
answer; but the fact remains that in every phase of art, whether music,
picture, or poem, such technical achievements have invariably found
admirers in any period of advanced civilisation. It has been said that
these forms display no higher aim than the verses printed to resemble
an hour-glass or altar, in some of our early poets; but such an
accusation is hardly worthy of serious reply. If the sonnet in Italian
form has gained world-wide fame, the principle of fixed form is at once
shown to be acceptable to the majority of scholars, and it becomes
only a question of degree whether these rondeaus and ballades gain so
prominent a place. It is hardly fair to expect to find among these
forms a lyric that has caught the ear of the public, and won its way
to the hearts of everyone; fifteen years of use is all they may claim,
and compared with the lyric poetry guileless of bonds, during the same
period, they at least hold their own. It must also be remembered that
they were adopted by the younger men, who won no small amount of their
present fame by these pretty devices.
ON THE RULES OF THE VARIOUS FORMS.--There are several general laws
governing these fixed metrical forms that must be insisted on at
the outset. The rule of the limited number of rhymes holds good of
nearly all. One feature prominent in the French rules is impossible in
English, as the difference between the rhyme masculine on words that
have not the _e_ mute for their final letter, and the rhyme feminine
on words that possess the _e_ mute, is unknown to us; but side by
side with the release from one binding law in French verse, a new one
is imposed. In that language, words of exactly similar _sound_ and
_spelling_ may be used to rhyme together, provided the meaning of the
words is distinct--such license the most doggerel bard would reject in
English--in spite of the precedent Milton offers, having "Ruth" and
"ruth" in one of his sonnets. Purists forbid in our tongue the use of
words of distinct spelling, but identical sound, as "sail" and "sale,"
"bear" and "bare;" nor would they allow words closely allied, as
"claim," "disclaim," "reclaim," to be employed, the strict rule being,
_that no syllable once used as a rhyme can be used again for that
purpose throughout the poem, not even if it be spelt differently while
keeping the same sound; nor if the whole word is altered by a prefix;
the syllable that rhymes must always be a new one both in sense and
sound_. It is this feature of the many rhymes to be found on a limited
root-sound that proves the initial difficulty in these shapes.
If the above rule is thought too strict--and it must be owned very
few writers acknowledge it to the extent of excluding such words as
"claim, acclaim, prove, reprove," etc.--at least such words should
be kept as far apart as possible, not used in the same stanza, if it
can be avoided, and never to rhyme with one another. Next in order,
but of equal, perhaps primary importance, is the use of the refrain.
This recurrent phrase is common in many languages; but the way these
ballades, rondeaus, and other shapes employ it, differs from all
others. In most old ballads and folk-songs the refrain comes as a
mere jingle, or, at best, an interlude, not reflecting the idea of
the verse it closes, nor varying its sense in spite of retaining its
sound, as it does in a perfect example of these forms. An ordinary
refrain in other poetry is usually kept to one note resounding through
the whole poem, much as the drone-bass in "pifferari" or "musette"
music is kept going throughout. In music there is another form of
bass always kept continuous--the ground-bass, on which Handel and
Bach built some mighty choruses; but in this the repeated sequence of
notes in the phrase, although they occur again and again unaltered,
have the superstructure welded into them, one splendid harmony--not,
as in the other, a melody merely floating over the accompaniment of
the one note or chord of the drone bass. It may be a somewhat forced
parallel, but in the instance quoted, and the fugue, canon, and other
contrapuntal laws of classical music, there is much in common with
these laws of strict metrical verse. The enormous use of set forms
in the masterpieces of tone-art may be a happy augury to the future
that yet awaits them in word-art. It may be said that at present the
poems dare claim no such success as the contrapuntal devices in music
can show, where the greatest works employ such devices frequently;
yet the leap from the simple forms of counterpoint to the works of
the mighty John Sebastian took but comparatively few years, although
the distance was so great. But fanciful parallels of this sort are
rarely satisfactory to any, except their maker, and need not be dwelt
on here. The refrain in each case is noticed more especially among the
laws of each form, but with regard to all the forms it is necessary to
insist on the importance of introducing it unaltered in sound on each
recurrence; it is sometimes changed by using, say, "and" for "but," or
"then" for "if;" but, without condemning any who take this license, it
is better to avoid it. Still, any change of meaning that be obtained by
alteration of punctuation, accent, or even of spelling, provided the
sound is unchanged, is not merely allowable but desirable, in lighter
verse especially. Without recommending the use of the pun pure and
simple, where its easy vulgarity would quickly be fatal to the dainty
conceits that mark the best humorous verse in these forms, yet any
pretty play upon words, or a sentence with new meaning read into it by
the context, is more than permissible, being present in the best models
of the Voiture rondeau and many triolets and ballades. This applies
chiefly to poems of the class called _Vers de Société_, for want of an
English synonym. The comic papers of our own country show no use of the
form quite so fine in burlesque treatment as some of the American ones,
notably the chant royal, _Mrs. Jones_, by Mr. H. C. Bunner; in the
burlesque examples printed in this book it will be seen that the forms
can be made to give added zest to satire or humour, beside imparting a
certain scholarly finish, that itself raises them from the terribly
dead level of much of our so-called comic poetry. A few shapes yet
await presentation in English dress. I have not succeeded in finding
specimens of the _glose_ or the _virelai_ (rhythme d'Alain Chartier),
while the example of the _virelai_ (_nouveau_), Mr. Dobson's "July,"
is the only one brought to light. The _lai_ and the _rondelet_ are
also very little used, so that anyone interested in these old measures
will yet find plenty of unhackneyed forms for experimenting upon. It
is curious that the sonnet, no less exacting in its technical rules,
and far more imperious in the treatment it demands, finds so many eager
followers, for with its wealth of literature, the chance of attaining
to the second rank even, among such splendid poems, requires a high
amount of talent, if not absolute genius. In the rondeau, or ballade,
many writers who are ignored in the ampler crowd of sonnet-makers might
find pleasing forms, not merely to display true poetic thoughts (if
they have the power to do so), but verse that has in its shape some air
of novelty still, and would sound less like the faint re-echoes of a
stronger song, the frequent effect of many a modern sonnet.
These few prefatory lines may well close with De Banville's own words
(in Mr. Lang's English)--"This cluster of forms is one of our most
precious treasures, for each of them forms a rhythmic whole, complete
and perfect, while at the same time they all possess the fresh and
unconscious grace which marks the production of primitive times." As
the translator adds, "There is some truth in this criticism, for it is
a mark of man's early ingenuity in many arts to seek complexity (where
you would expect simplicity), and yet to lend to that complexity an
infantine naturalness. One can see this phenomenon in early decorative
art, and in early law and custom, and even in the complicated
structure of primitive languages. Now, just as early and even savage
races are our masters in the decorative use of colour and of carving,
so the nameless mastersingers of ancient France may be our teachers in
decorative poetry--the poetry some call _vers de société_."
In analysing the structure of these forms, it would be, no doubt,
possible for a master to present them in English, as terse and
epigrammatic as the French of de Banville or de Gramont. But there
would be a danger in so doing. A famous prelate is said to have
apologised for a long letter, on the ground that he had not time to
write a short one: this anecdote may be paraphrased here, for it often
happens that many have time to run through a discursive, gossipy
description, when they could not devote the attention needful to
_read_ a short one. If every word is carefully chosen, and used in an
exact way to convey as much as possible, it requires no less careful
reading;--as in some of our Science Primers, where the material for
an ordinary chapter is condensed and reduced to the crystal of a
single sentence, that demands almost equal exactness in obtaining
its solution, if one would absorb all the learning compressed in so
small a compass. This excuse may serve in lieu of a better for the
somewhat prolix method in which these rules are presented. Let no one
imagine that the most perfect knowledge of the laws of these forms is
enough to start him in writing poetry; for such rules are but what the
fundamental rules of arithmetic are to astronomers--all important as
the basis, but powerless, without genius and science, to discover new
worlds, or formulate an hypothesis for the existence of known ones.
If such books as those the present chapter follows are looked upon as
handbooks to making _poetry_, that one stupendous flight of imagination
is probably the only one its author is fated to achieve.
THE BALLADE.--In the alphabetical sequence adopted in the arrangement
of this volume, the _Ballade_ happily comes first. This is as it
should be, since no other of these forms has been more frequently
used in English, nor, it may be, is any other so capable of variety,
since among its successful examples many different treatments will be
found. This form adapts itself to its subject, and may be sonorous or
stately, playful or easy, at the will of its writer, as, in capable
hands, it can strike any note in the gamut of passions, from religious
exaltation or fierce grim satire, to actual pathos, or, if needful,
pure burlesque. It is possible the _Ballade_ will never be written so
strictly to one model as the sonnet, but that many variations--to be
noticed presently--will each find admirers; but the existing examples
warrant a belief that the shape will continue in our poetry, for it is
impossible, in face of many hundred examples, to style it an exotic at
the present day.
The construction of the _Ballade_, although not less stern in insisting
on the introduction of a refrain than many of the other shapes, uses
it at wider intervals, and so escapes the besetting danger of such
forms as the _villanelle_ or _triolet_, where its constant recurrence
may easily become as senseless as the "with a fal, la, la" of the
old madrigal writers, unless it be very skilfully brought in. Again,
its length, generally of twenty-eight or thirty-five lines, with the
refrain in either case appearing but four times, allows room to display
the subject, and yet forbids the diffuseness of many ordinary lyrics,
where one fancies a happy rhyme-sound is often responsible for the
intrusion of an additional couplet or quatrain, that weakens the whole
poem. Its length, moreover, strictly within hard and fast limits though
it be, is not so cramped as the fourteen lines of the true sonnet,
nor has tradition fixed the style of treatment of the central idea.
The narrative ballade is perfectly legitimate, provided the writer
has sufficient power to overcome the extreme difficulty it presents.
It is often urged that the unalterable sequence of rhymes, which must
be found after the set of three or five are once chosen, proves a
hindrance to the imagination of the poet who uses it. M. Lemâitre has
answered this objection very aptly. He says--"The poet who begins a
ballade does not know very exactly what he will put into it. The rhyme,
and nothing but the rhyme, will whisper things unexpected and charming,
things he would never have thought of but for her, things with strange
and remote relations to each other, all united in the disorder of a
dream. Nothing, indeed, is richer in suggestion than the strict laws of
these difficult pieces; they force the fancy to wander afield, hunting
high and low; and while she seeks through all the world the foot that
can wear Cinderella's slipper, she makes delightful discoveries by the
The BALLADE, in its normal type, consists of three stanzas of eight
lines, followed by a verse of four lines, known as the envoy, or three
verses of ten lines, with envoy of five, each of the stanzas and the
envoy closing with the refrain. The most important rules for the
ballade may be put briefly:--_First_, The same set of rhymes in the
same order they occupy in the first stanza must repeat throughout the
whole of its verses. _Secondly_, No word once used as a rhyme must be
used again for that purpose in the whole length of the poem. _Thirdly_,
Each stanza and the envoy must close with the refrain; the envoy
always taking the same rhymes as the last half of the preceding verse,
in the same order. For the eight-lined ballade, but three rhymes are
allowable. In ordinary rhyme formula the sequence of these is A, B, A,
B, B, C, B, C, for each of the three verses, and B, C, B, C, for the
envoy. The importance of the refrain must now be noticed. Old writers
and purists of our own time insist that the length of the refrain
should govern not only the length of each line, but the number of the
lines; in other words, that a refrain of eight syllables involves the
choice of an eight-lined stanza, while the refrain of ten syllables
demands a ten-lined verse. This is the strict rule of the ballade as
written by Clement Marot, and by some modern writers; but it must be
clearly understood that it is only the rule for the ideally pure form,
and that variations in this respect are perfectly allowable. Now the
importance of the refrain in one aspect is given, a still more vital
point must be named--namely, that the sense of the refrain must be
supreme throughout the ballade, the culminating line of each stanza
always brought in without effort as the natural close of the verse.
In the verses a special feature must not be overlooked, namely, that
the stanza (of eight or ten lines, as the case may be) should carry
an unbroken sense throughout, and not split into two verses of four
lines or five lines, that are by chance printed as though they were
one. The needful pauses for punctuation are of course allowed, but the
sense should not finish at the end of the first quatrain (or quintain),
but demand the rest of the verse to complete the idea presented. All
these apparently trivial details must be regarded if the ballade is
attempted. The advice given in _Alice in Wonderland_, "Take care of
the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves," whether in
that way or its inversion, "Take care of the sounds and the sense will
take care of itself," is exactly the direct opposite of the true rule.
Neither sense nor sound may be scamped here. If you neglect the sounds
it is no ballade; if you neglect the sense--why write it at all? No one
is compelled to use these complex forms, but if chosen, their laws
must be obeyed to the letter if success is to be attained. The chief
pleasure they yield consists in the apparent spontaneity, which is the
result of genius, if genius be indeed the art of taking infinite pains;
or, if that definition is rejected, they must yet exhibit the art which
conceals art, whether by intense care in every minute detail, or a
happy faculty for naturally wearing these fetters. The dance in chains
must be skilful, the chains worn as decorative adjuncts, and the whole
with as much apparent ease as the unfettered dancer could produce, or
woe betide the unlucky wight who attempts to perform in them.
The ENVOY is so peculiarly a feature of the Ballade and Chant Royal,
that it is needful to draw our attention to the invocation which with
it invariably commences. Of old this envoy was really addressed to
the patron of the poet, or at least to the high dignitary to whom he
dedicated his ballade. So that we find Prince! or Princess! Sire! or
some mythical or symbolical personality invoked in the opening word.
Often the person chosen was in very truth a noble of the rank assigned,
but the custom of opening the envoy in this fashion grew so common that
it lost its special fitness, and was often employed as a conventional
ascription to those not of noble rank, while in some instances all
the lovers' ballades intended for their own ladies were yet ascribed
by the poets to the "Princess" of the court, who quite understood the
fiction employed, and accepted praise of the golden hair and blue eyes
of the rightful owner of the poem, while possibly her royal tresses
were black and her eyes brown. In the number of ballades included
in this collection the larger number will still be found to follow
the old custom, which is so marked that the use of this dedication
certainly carries out the spirit of the poem, in accordance with its
original design. The envoy is not only a dedication, but should be the
peroration of the subject, and richer in its wording and more stately
in its imagery than the preceding verses, to convey the climax of the
whole matter, and avoid the suspicion that it is a mere postscript, as
it were, to the ballade.
In the ballade with stanzas of ten lines, usually of ten syllables
each, four rhymes are permitted in this order--A, B, A, B, B, C, C,
D, C, D, with C, C, D, C, D for the envoy. It is not needful to quote
examples, or describe varieties with eight or ten-lined stanzas, that
have lines of equal or unequal length, but in other respects follow
all the true rules. De Gramont has observed that the strict laws of
the _ballade_ belong more to the prosodists who studied the form
after it had ceased to be in current use, and that the writers of the
_ballade_ themselves frequently took great liberty. In some by Marot
there are verses of eleven or twelve decasyllabic lines, and in poets
who preceded him, some with thirteen and fourteen lines to the stanza,
while the number of verses has also been flagrantly disregarded, some
even using four or five verses, and still worse, having different
rhymes to them; but in such cases the poem must not be regarded as an
irregular ballade, nor a ballade at all, but simply as a set of verses
with refrain.
The _Ballade with double refrain_, of which the "Frere Lubin" of
Clement Marot is the only well-known example in old French, is said
by Thomas Sibilet, in his _Art Poétique_, 1555, to be "_autant rare
que plaisante_." Its point of difference is that a second refrain is
introduced at the fourth line of each stanza, and the second of the
envoy. This necessarily alters the order of the rhymes of the envoy.
In the best known English example the rhyme order is A, B, A, B, B,
C, B, C, with B, B, C, C, for the envoy. There are several in modern
English, and some in recent French.
The _Double Ballade_ consists of six stanzas of eight or ten lines, and
is written usually without an envoy. The "Ballade of Dead Lions," in
_London_, January 12, 1878, was the first English specimen; it is not
quoted here, as its subject is now out of date. De Banville has written
several. "_Pour les bonnes gens_," "_Des sottises de Paris_" are two in
his "_Trente-six Ballades Joyeuses_" written in this form.
M. de Banville humorously reveals a secret of the poet's workshop,
and gives a method to construct a "correct" ballade in a mechanical
fashion, dispensing with genius, and easy to work--First, at one
sitting write the last half of all the verses, and at another time
the first half, then join them together, and the result will be an
irremediably bad ballade; but elsewhere he writes, in all seriousness
this time, "All the art is to bring in the refrain without effort,
naturally, gaily, and at each time with novel effect and with fresh
light cast on the central idea. 'Now you can' teach 'no one to do that,
and M. de Banville never pretends to give any receipts for cooking
_rondels_ or _ballades_ worth reading.' Without poetic vision all is
mere marqueterie and cabinetmaker's work; that is, so far as poetry is
The CHANT ROYAL is now accepted by most writers as merely a larger
form of the ballade, written with five verses of eleven lines, and
envoi of five. De Gramont treats the idea to regard it as a distinct
form as a mere fanciful attempt of prosodists, founded chiefly on the
fact that Clement Marot has left four so named which conform to the
above rule; but he shows that on the one hand there are ballades with
stanzas of eleven lines, and on the other chants royal with ten only.
It has been suggested that the _Chant Royal_ derived its name from
the subjects that are more usually dedicated to its use; but while
these are generally sublime topics treated in dignified allegory, yet
there are examples extant entirely devoid of these characteristics.
Again, the idea that it owes its name to being a form selected for
competition before the king for the dignity of laureate, and hence
dubbed royal-song, he also rejects, and points out that its name
simply denotes that it is the most excellent form of the ballade (as
we might say, the "king of ballades" in English), one that, from
the increased length, both in stanzas and number of lines in each,
largely augments the difficulties of construction met with in the
true ballade, and marks it as "the final _tour de force_ of poetic
composition." Henry de Croï derives the title of this form from the
fact that persons excelling in the composition of chants royal were
worthy to be crowned with garlands like conquerors and kings. It is
a moot point with students whether the ballade or chant royal is the
earlier and original poem. The chant royal in the old form is usually
devoted to the unfolding of an allegory in its five stanzas, the envoy
supplying the key; but this is not always observed in modern examples.
Whatever be the subject, however, it must always march in stately
rhythm with splendid imagery, using all the poetic adornments of
sonorous, highly-wrought lines and rich embroidery of words to clothe
a theme in itself a lofty one. Unless the whole poem is constructed
with intense care, and has intrinsic beauty of its own of no mean
order, the monotony of its sixty-one lines rhymed on five sounds is
unbearable. In spite of the increased burden imposed by the necessity
of so many similar rhymes, no shadow of "poetic" or other license must
be taken. Nothing short of complete success can warrant the choice of
this exacting form, which demands all that can be given to it; enriched
with all the elaboration of consummate art in its every detail, and
rising stanza by stanza, until the climax is reached in the envoy.
The laws of the ballade apply to the chant royal, with some added
details of its own. The rhyme order is usually--a, b, a, b, c, c, d, d,
e, d, e, with envoy of d, d, e, d, e. An example by Deschamps, "_Sur le
mort du Seigneur de Coucy_," observes this order, a, b, a, b, b, c, c,
d, c, d, and envoy, c, c, d, c, c, d. In either case the rhyme-order
must be kept the same for each stanza, and the envoy commenced with an
invocation as in the old ballades.
CHAIN VERSE.--There is one beautiful poem in so-called chain verse,
which has so much likeness to these once-exotic forms that it deserves
quotation in full, if only as an example of a native specimen of poetic
ingenuity. It has little affinity with the chain verse of French art,
as then the one word only grew from each line into the other (La rime
Enchaînée).
Dieu des Amans, de mort me garde
Me gardant donne-moi bonheur,
Et me le donnant prend ta darde
Et la prenant navre son coeur
Et le navrant me tiendras seur.
--_Clement Marot._
The following hymn was written by John Byrom, and published in vol. ii.
of his _Posthumous Poems_, 1773:--
My spirit longeth for Thee,
Within my troubled breast,
Although I be unworthy
Of so Divine a Guest.
Of so Divine a Guest
Unworthy though I be,
Yet has my heart no rest,
Unless it comes from Thee.
Unless it comes from Thee,
In vain I look around;
In all that I can see
No rest is to be found.
No rest is to be found
But in thy blessèd love:
Oh, let my wish be crowned,
And send it from above.
_The Answer._
Cheer up, desponding soul,
Thy longing pleased I see:
'Tis part of that great whole
Wherewith I longed for Thee.
Wherewith I longed for Thee
And left my Father's throne,
From death to set thee free,
To claim thee for my own.
To claim thee for my own
I suffered on the cross:
O! were my love but known,
No soul need fear its loss.
No soul need fear its loss,
But, filled with love divine,
Would die on its own cross
And rise for ever thine.
This has so many points resembling the forms in this book, that it
seemed worth quoting, if only to compare with the Malay Pantoum, the
Villanelle, and the Rondel.
KYRIELLE.--The _Kyrielle_ is so simple, and so widely used by writers,
all unwittingly, that but for M. de Banville including it, it would
be left unnoticed here. It is merely a poem in four-lined verses of
eight-syllable lines, having the last line of each the same. Our hymn
books show many, witness "Jesus! Son of Mary, hear," or "Jesus, our
Love, is crucified." It is a device so evident that it has naturally
been used in almost all schools of poetry, and may be dismissed with no
more words here.
PANTOUM.--The _Pantoum_, at first sight, has little reason for being
included in a volume of verse in strict traditional forms, that are
nearly all of French origin, since it is of Malay invention; but being
