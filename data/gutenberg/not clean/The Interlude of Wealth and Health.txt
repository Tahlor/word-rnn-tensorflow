This early English text was printed in a black-letter font. Some of
the letters used are not found on a typewriter. In the e-text those
letters that have no modern equivalent are transcribed with their
meaning. For example, there is a letter that looks like a "w" with a
"t" over it. This means with. You will find this in the text as
All typos were kept as close as possible to the original. This
e-text is based on the 1907 edition which included a long list of
these typos and some of their possible meanings along with the
editor's note. This list had many letters typeset upside down. For
this e-text they were righted.
Long s has been changed to standard short s.
In the plain text version, letters with a macron over them are
denoted by placing them in brackets with an = beside them, such as
are shown with tilde.
Speaker names are surrounded by + like +Health+.

_March 1907._ W.W. Greg.
Early in the craft year which began on 19 July 1557, and was the first
of the chartered existence of the Stationers' Company, John Waley, or
Wally, entered what was no doubt the present play on the Register along
with several other works. The entry runs as follows:
To master John wally these bokes Called Welth and helthe/the
treatise of the ffrere and the boye / stans puer ad mensam another
of youghte charyte and humylyte an a b c for cheldren in englesshe
with syllabes also a boke called an hundreth mery tayles ij^s
That Waley printed an edition is therefore to be presumed, but it does
not necessarily follow that the extant copy, which though perfect bears
neither date nor printer's name, ever belonged to it. Indeed, a
comparison with a number of works to which he did affix his name
suggests grave doubts on the subject. Though not a high-class printer,
there seems no reason to ascribe to him a piece of work which for
badness alike of composition and press-work appears to be unique among
the dramatic productions of the sixteenth century.
'Wealth and health' appears among the titles in the list of plays
appended to the edition of Goffe's _Careless Shepherdess_, printed for
Rogers and Ley in 1656. The entry was repeated with the designation
addition, in those of Kirkman in 1661 and 1671. In 1691 Langbaine wrote
'_Wealth and Health_, a Play of which I can give no Account.' Gildon has
no further information to offer, nor have any of his immediate
followers. Chetwood, in 1752, classes it among 'Plays Wrote by Anonymous
it 'an Interlude' and dates it 1602. This invention was only copied in
those lists which depended directly on Chetwood's, such as the
_Playhouse Pocket-Companion_ of 1779. Meanwhile, in his _Companion to
the Play-House_ of 1764, D.E. Baker, relying upon Coxeter's notes, gave
an essentially accurate description of the piece, except that he
asserted it to be 'full of Sport and mery Pastyme,' and described it as
an octavo. This entry has been copied by subsequent bibliographers, none
of whom have seen the original.
The play was among those discovered in Ireland in the spring of 1906 and
sold at Sotheby's on 30 June, when it was purchased for the British
Museum at the price of one hundred and ninety-five pounds. Its
press-mark is C. 34. i. 25.
The extremely careless typography of the original makes the task of
reprinting a difficult one. Ordinary misprints abound, and these have
been scrupulously retained, a list of irregularities being added below.
It has, however, proved impossible to arrive at any satisfactory method
of distinguishing between 'n' and 'u.' In the first hundred lines, which
are by no means the worst printed, there are thirty-two cases in which
the letter is indistinguishable, eighteen cases of an apparent 'u' which
should be 'n,' and seven cases of an apparent 'n' which should be 'u.'
When it is further remembered that there are few cases in which it is
possible to say for certain that a letter really is what it appears to
be, and none in which it may not be turned, some idea of the difficulty
in the way of reprinting will be obtained. To have followed the original
in this matter would have been to introduce another misprint into at
least every fourth line, while even so several hundred cases would have
remained which could only have been decided according to the apparent
sense of the passage. The only rational course was to treat the letters
as indistinguishable throughout, and to print in each instance
whichever the sense seemed to require. Again, as the superscript letters
'c,' 'e,' 't,' are seldom distinguishable, the printer has been given
the benefit of the doubt. Another difficulty arose in connection with
the speakers' names. In the original these have often dropt from their
proper places, which can now only be ascertained from the sense and the
not very regular indentation. With some hesitation it has been decided
to restore them to the positions they should apparently occupy, noting
all cases in which they are a line or more out in the original. Lastly
it may be remarked that in the speeches which aim at imitating foreign
languages the apparent readings of the very indistinct original have
been scrupulously reproduced, and no attempt has been made, even in the
subjoined list, to suggest any corrections.
In the last sheet some of the pages are cropt at the foot. In most cases
nothing more than the catchword has disappeared, and although between
lines 768 and 769 something seems to be lost, it is doubtful whether
this is due to the cropping, since D1^v has already one line too many.
The original is printed in the ordinary black letter of the period, of
the body known as English (20 ll. = 94 mm.).

¶ Here entreth Welth, and Helth synging together
a balet of two partes, and after speaketh
Welth.
Why is there no curtesy, now I am come
I tcowe that all the people be dume
Or els so god helpe me and halydum
They were almost a fleepe.
No wordes I harde, nor yet no talking
No instrument went nor ballattes synging
What ayles you all thus to syt dreaming                               10
Of whom take ye care?
Of my coming ye may be glad
Therefore I pray you be nof sad
For all your desyre shall be had
I can amende your cheare
By God I thinke ye haue forgotten me
I am welth of this realme looke upon me
For I am to euery man louing and freendly
For welth hath no pere.
+Helth.+ Brother welth haue ye not yet doone?                       20
ye prayse your selfe aboue the moone
Euery man may perceyue therby soone
That you lacke discresyon
+Weith.+ Wherfore, by god I cannot say to much
Iam so welthy of substaunce and rych
In all the worlde where is one such
As I am ofcomparison.
+Helth.+ Welth is good I cannot denay
Yet prayse your selfe so muche ye may
For welth oftentimes doth decay                                       30
And welth is nothing sure.
+Welth.+ Welth hath ben euer in this countrey
And here I purpose styll for to be
For this is the lande most mete for me
And here I wyll endure.
+Health+ Therin ye speake full louingle
For in this realme welth should be
yeth no displeasure I pray you hartely
But in the way of communicacion.
And for pastyme I would speake some wayes                           40
Of no comparison, nor to you no dyspayre,
I doo not intende that maner alwayes,
But for a recreation,
+Wealth+ Brother what soeuer ye say to me.
I wyll heare you paciently
I am content and I thanke you hartely
Begyn and say your pleasure
+Health+ I thanke you hartely then wyll I
Some what unto my purpose apply
Though welth be praised marualufly                                    50
Yet to myne understanding.
Welth is mutable, and that iu shame
And welth is hauty and proude of name
Welth is cruell, and in great blame
For welth ts euer wauerynge.
+Wealth.+ To whom haue I doone any harme can ye say,
Ye stander me nowe, yet I trust I may
Aunswere for my selte in euery maner way
Ye wyl not deny that?
+Health+ God forbyd but ye should do so                             60
And ye may doo it whether I wyl or no
Inlykewise, I must answer you also
Wh en ye say not true.
Though I be but to you a poore man
yet helth I height, the same I am
That is desyred vniuersally than
Some calles me as good as you
+Welth.+ As I, mary ther in deede ye do compare.
Such wordes myght brynge you soone in care
Lewde parson, thouart not ware                                        70
Of what substaunce I am
+Health.+ Yes I can tell what you are, be not dyspleased
welth is of great substaunce, that cannot be denyed
yet shew your comodities, and ye shalbe answerrd
I promyse you wellh is fugitiue.
+wealth+ What sayst thou, am I a fagetyue
I was neuer so taken vp in my lyfe
Nor called vnsure, well I wyll make no stryfe
yet where as thou dost say,
Thai I should show my commodityes alwayes                           80
The best for my selfe wherof I aske prayse
yf I shoulde stand her all my lyfe dayes
yet I coulde not say.
Nor halfe the benefites that commeth of me
yt cannot be tolde nor resyted shortly
Welth is the floure of althing earthly
That you cannot denye.
Ferste god saue, our soueraine Ladye the Queene
With all the counsel and all that with them bene
Am not I welth with them euer at ene                                  90
Who should be there but I?
Men of the lawe, and ioly rych marchauntes
There be welthy both of goodes and lands,
Without comparyson is in their handes
I welth hatg all freasure.
+Health.+ O good syr, of whom commeth all this
Of god only, to you no thanke Iwys
And yet mans welth stands not all in ryches
I dare saye that boldly,
Whan a man hath a cempetent liuing                                 100
with the grace of god that passeth all thyng
Loue of his neyghbour, and good reporting
Then is he welthy,
Welth of goodes is but a fame
Ye is welthy that hath a good name
Euery wyse man wyll coueyte the same
For otherwelth I not reche
yf a man haue neuer so much good name
Euerywise man wyll coueyte the same
if his dtsposicions be nought and wood                               110
Then he is but a wretch,
+Welth.+ Nay thou art a wretch, and a foole vnwyse
welth of ryches thus to despyse
Doest thou not se all the worlde aryse
By goodes and substaunce
He that hath plenty of syluer and golde
May haue all thyng whatsoeuer he woulde
Whan can welth lacke, seing all thing is solde
And welth is of assuraunce.
+Health+ I denye that, your saying is nought                       120
Grace, heauen, nor cunning, cannot be bought
without great paine, ad good dedes wrought
Els man cannot them haue.
+wealth+ Stop thereat, and hold thy peace
May not men by heauen with richesse
As to bylde churches and make bye wayes
Such deedes mans soule doth saue
+Health+ Yea, but yet ye must marke one thynge
yf these goodes came with wronge doyng
Shall ye haue heauen for so spendynge                                130
Or yet any mede.
Nay nay except that man himselfe doo meeke
And make resystance the ryght honour to seeke
Els all such good dedes is not woth a leeke
welth hereof take heede.
+wealth.+ Why thinkest thou that all men which hath welth
Getteth theyr goodes with brybry and stealeth
Thy reporte is nought therfore Helthe
I counsell thee to say the best.
+Health+ So I wyll, but yet I must say true                        140
And now a lyttle more I wyll say to you
Much sorowe and care welth doth brewe
He is seldome in rest.
when a man is a lyttle hit and welthy
And hath in his cheste treasures plentye
Then wyl he wrangle, and do shreudly
By his power and might.
With his neighboures he wyll go to lawe
And a wreke his malyce for valew of strawe
welth is fykle and out nf awe                                        150
wylfull in wronge or ryght
+Welth.+ Thou speakest with a slaunderous tonge
All of euyll wyll, and yet it is wronge
welth in this realme hath bin longe
Of me commeth great honour.
Because that I welth hath great porte
All the worlde, hyther doth resorte
Therfore I welth, am this realmes comfort,
And here I wyll indure.
+Helth.+ So I wold ye should, and I shall do the same              160
Helth I am called, and that is my name
If I would not abyde heare I were to blame
For here I am well cherished
Yet say your selfe, nhw indifferenily
And if euery man doo not loue me
Helth as well as welth, yes verely
Therof I dare be reported
+Weith.+ Why should they loue thee? that woulde I knowe
As wel as me, I pray you showe
I am the superiour of hie and lowe                                   170
No man may compare with me.
+Helth.+ To shew why I wyll not be afraied
For I can bide by that I haue sayde
Yf welthy men be very well apayd
Or muche they set you by.
But of welth, if they haue neuer so much
Goodes, tryasure and golde, and be called rych
Yet yfthey lacke helth, there payne is suche
That they were better dye.
A man to were golde, and be in payne                               180
What ioy hath he? none, but would be fayne
To giue all his treasure for helth playne
Or els he were very mad:
For if a man be neuer so poure
Yet if he haue helth, that is a treasure,
Then for his liuing, he may laboure
And in his harte be glad,
+Welth.+ I neuer marked thus muche, nor vnderstood
That Helth was such a treasure, and to man so good
Wherfore I am sory, and I wil chaunge my moode                       190
Now I pray you forgiue me.
+Health+ I will forgiue or els I were to blame
And I pray you to forgiue me the same
I loue you hartly, and wyll prayse your name
yf it please youto keepe my company.
¶ Here entreth lyberty with a song & after speaketh

I see well ye looked not for my comming
Loe, out of syght out of remembryng

Goe pyke strawes and take me rest.
I pray you tell me whom I haue offended

+liberty+ What was the matter, I pray you tell
Me thinkes I ought to be of counsel
Or els I promyse you ye doo not well
With you I should beholde.
+Welth.+ The matter is doone we are agreed
To reason it more it shall not neede
O brother helth, thou art in deede
More preciouser than golde.
+liberty.+ Gods bodi how commeth this gere to pas
I am cast out at the cartes arse                                     230
The worlde is nothing as it was
For I am here refused
+Health+ Why be you angry that we doo agree
Then are ye not wyse, for ifye loue me
I will loue hym agayne, so it should be
Or els I were mysaduised
+yllibert+ Then of my loue ye set no store
My company I see well ye looked notfore
Farewell I wyll get me out of the doore

Willing to fulfil his soueraines commaundement

And we put you in trust for the same
To kepe such rule, it is a shame

As his fast in your kechin, or seller truly.

He warned vs that we should take hede
Of excesse and prodigalitie.                                         710
+Wytte+ I meruayle ye speake so of good remedy
It is I that can do more than he
Wyt can make shyft at necessity
When Remedi cannot be hearde

Sought god remedy and yet neuer rhe nere

For wit is a crafty lad.
+Wyll.+ And wyl is an vngracious stay
Wyl hath doone many thinges men say                                  720

Hauing in him self remorse, & mendes in tyme & space

Therfore I wyl stand asyde, & a lyttel whyle remaine
Of welth, Helth and Lybertye, for to inquire

+Remdi+ I am halfe ashamed, that long it hath ben sayd
That noble men by such wretches hath ben deceiued
they did reioyce and iest, and were very well apaide
Trusting to scape cleare, and styl for to haue rained
But now they shall not so, let them be wel assured                   900
That ylwyl and shrewde wyt shal haue but yl rest
For wheresoeuer they be I wyll breake theyr nest

This is a good example and lerning to you all
Now serue god and loue him, & for grace euer call
And ylwyl and shrewdewyt, from you I shall abstaine

+health.+ Forsoth syr ye sai trouth, they did vs great displesur
Full hard it is to vanquishe the vngrocious ylwyl
He is so croked, by flattery, dissulation & such other
Mannes mynd is so variable, & glad to report yl                      920
I feare many one yet wolde haue him raine styll
For some vnto their owne wyl hath so much affection
yet the devyl and yl wyl is both of one complexion
+liberty=+ yll wyll is nought, but worse is shrewdwyt
For he contryueth al subtil ymanginacien
yt were vnpossyble for a man els to doo it
shrewdwyt breweth myscef, & false conspyracion
He hath put me lyberty in prison, ad great tribulacion
+Remdi+ Be al of good chere, and haue no mistrust
The ende of yl wyl and shrewd wyt is but shame
Though they reygne a while, wrongfully and uniust
yet truth wyll appeare and their misdedes blame
Then wronge is subdued, and good remedy tane
