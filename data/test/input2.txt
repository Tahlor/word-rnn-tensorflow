Spring, the sweet Spring, is the year's pleasant king; 
Then blooms each thing, then maids dance in a ring, 
Cold doth not sting, the pretty birds do sing, 
Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo! 

The palm and may make country houses gay, 
Lambs frisk and play, the shepherds pipe all day, 
And we hear aye birds tune their merry lay, 
Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo! 

The fields breathe sweet, the daisies kiss our feet, 
Young lovers meet, old wives a-sunning sit, 
In every street these tunes our ears do greet, 
Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo! 
Spring, the sweet Spring! 

Phoebus, arise! 
And paint the sable skies 
With azure, white, and red: 
Rouse Memnon's mother from her Tithon's bed 
That she may thy career with roses spread: 
The nightingales thy coming each where sing: 
Make an eternal spring! 
Give life to this dark world which lieth dead; 
Spread forth thy golden hair 
In larger locks than thou wast wont before, 
And emperor-like decore 
With diadem of pearl thy temples fair: 
Chase hence the ugly night 
Which serves but to make dear thy glorious light. 

—This is that happy morn, 
That day, long wishéd day 
Of all my life so dark, 
(If cruel stars have not my ruin sworn 
And fates not hope betray), 
Which, purely white, deserves 
An everlasting diamond should it mark. 
This is the morn should bring unto this grove 
My Love, to hear and recompense my love. 
Fair King, who all preserves, 
But show thy blushing beams, 
And thou two sweeter eyes 
Shalt see than those which by Penéus' streams 
Did once thy heart surprize. 
Now, Flora, deck thyself in fairest guise: 
If that ye winds would hear 
A voice surpassing far Amphion's lyre, 
Your furious chiding stay; 
Let Zephyr only breathe 
And with her tresses play. 
—The winds all silent are, 
And Phoebus in his chair 
Ensaffroning sea and air 
Makes vanish every star: 
Night like a drunkard reels 
Beyond the hills, to shun his flaming wheels: 
The fields with flowers are deck'd in every hue, 
The clouds with orient gold spangle their blue; 
Here is the pleasant place— 
And nothing wanting is, save She, alas. 






When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced 
The rich proud cost of out-worn buried age; 
When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed, 
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage. 

When I have seen the hungry ocean gain 
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore, 
And the firm soil win of the watery main, 
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store. 

When I have seen such interchange of state, 
Or state itself confounded to decay, 
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate— 
That Time will come and take my Love away. 

—This thought is as a death, which cannot choose 
But weep to have that which it fears to lose. 






Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea, 
But sad mortality o'ersways their power, 
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, 
Whose action is no stronger than a flower? 

O how shall summer's honey breath hold out, 
Against the wreckful siege of battering days, 
When rocks impregnable are not so stout, 
Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays? 

O fearful meditation, where, alack! 
Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid? 
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back, 
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid? 

none, unless this miracle have might, 
That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
